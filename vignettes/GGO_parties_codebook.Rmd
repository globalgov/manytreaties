## Release 1.0

This document provides a brief overview of the coding rationale for key variables 
in the dataset of states' relationships to international agreements 
provided in `manytreaties::parties$GGO`. 

Note that this dataset was constructed as a complement to datasets such as 
the International Environmental Agreements Database (`manytreaties::parties$IEADB`)
and the Design of Trade Agreements Database (`manytreaties::parties$DESTA`).
As such, it is neither complete in observations nor variables,
but offers some additional or alternative coding to other datasets.

Work on this dataset was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)
[Grant Number 188976](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188976): 
"Power and Networks and the Rate of Change in Institutional Complexes" (PANARCHIC).

The variables are as follows:
`r paste(names(manytreaties::parties$GGO), collapse = ", ")`.

## Identification: stateID, treatyID, Title

These are the identifying variables of this dataset.
The `stateID` is a standard three-letter country code as defined in `manystates::code_states()`.
The `Title` is the title of the agreement as listed on the treaty text itself,
or as listed in the source from which the treaty was identified.
The `treatyID` is a meaningful shorthand ID created from a combination of
elements extracted from the agreement title and date.
See `manytreaties::code_agreements()` for more details.
