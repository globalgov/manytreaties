Provisions deal with, inter alia, the levying of duties (art. 2 to 8), custom controls (art. 9), smuggling (art. 12) and vessel and raft certificates (art. 22 to 25). Parties are to, inter alia, maintain in good order port facilities and the existing twopaths and Rhine channel (art. 28), exchange information and consult on hydro-technic projects and take all necessary steps to ensure that navigation on the Rhine is not obstructed (art. 30). Tribunals are to be established to try cases concerning navigation on the Rhine (art. 33), and the Rhine is to be divided into inspection districts to be surveyed by inspectors yearly (art. 42). Institutional mechanisms: A Central Commission is established to, inter alia, examine all complaints arising from the application of the Convention, render judgement in cases of appeal, and prepare each year a report on the state of the Rhine navigation (art. 45).;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;19631120|19721025|19791017;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE

Objectives: To determine uniform rules concerning the liability of operators of nuclear ships. Summary of provisions: Parties agree that the operator of a nuclear ship is absolutely liable for any nuclear damage upon proof of the causal link between the damage and a nuclear incident involving the nuclear fuel of, or radioactive products or waste produced in, such ships (art. II). The operator is required to maintain insurance, or other financial security covering his liability for nuclear damage (art. III). He also has a right of recourse in certain conditions, and may be exonerated partially or completely from his liability. Further articles provide for, inter alia, a financial limit to the operator's liability (art. III), prescription (art. V), and joint and several liability (art. VII). Damages which give right to compensation claims are defined in art. XIII. Parties undertake to adopt such measures as are necessary to ensure implementation of the provisions of the Convention (art. XII).

Summary of provisions: The operator of a nuclear installation is liable for nuclear damage on provision of proof that such damage was caused by an incident within the installation, or involving nuclear material originating therefrom or being sent thereto (art. 2). The liability of the operator in such a case is absolute, but the courts may make a finding of contributory negligence on the part of the person suffering such damage. In any case the operator will not be liable if the nuclear incident was due directly to an act of armed conflict, civil war, insurrection or a grave natural disaster of an exceptional character (art. 4). Limits of liability and limitation of action are established (arts. 5 and 6). The operator is to maintain insurance or financial security to cover his liability (art. 7).

Summary of provisions Parties may take such measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests from pollution or threat of pollution of the sea by oil (art. 1). Before taking action, a coastal State should notify the flag State of the ship, consult independent experts and notify any person whose interests may reasonably be expected to be affected by such action. In cases of extreme urgency measure may be taken at once. In any case the coastal State must endeavour to protect human life and assist persons in distress (art. 3). Such measures are not to go beyond what is reasonably necessary to achieve the end mentioned in article 1, and are to be proportionate to the damage, actual or threatened (art. 5).

Summary of provisions: This Agreement is made between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the European Atomic Energy Community (the Community) and the non- nuclear weapon States members of Euratom (hereafter the States). The States undertake to accept safeguards on all sources or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within their territories, under their jurisdiction or carried out under their control anywhere to verify that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (art. 1). Material accountancy is to be used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance, with containment and surveillance as important complementary measures (art. 29). The safeguards provided in this Agreement are to be implemented in a manner designed to avoid hampering the economic and technological development or international cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, to avoid undue interference in the peaceful nuclear activities of the Community and be consistent with prudent management practices (art. 5). The Agency agrees to take every precaution to protect commercial and industrial secrets and other confidential information (art.6). The Agreement specifies the conditions under which the safeguards apply and what information is to be provided. A reporting system is established (art. 59-69) along with an inspection procedure (art. 70-90). It establishes the conditions under which the transfer into or out of the States is to be the responsibility of the Community (art. 91-97). Important terms are defined in article 98.

Summary of provisions: The damage must originate beyond the coastal low-water line of a State Party, and be suffered in the territory, including the internal and territorial waters, of such a State, or in the areas in which it has sovereign rights over natural resources (art. 2). Liability rests on the operator of the installation from which such damage originates and extends five years after the abandonment of such installation as defined by the Convention (art. 3). The operator is to be exonerated, wholly or in part, if he can prove the damage was caused by an act or omission of the victim with the intent to cause damage, or by the victim s negligence. Liability of the operator is limited for each installation and each incident, unless damage caused by deliberate act of the operator himself (art. 6). Parties that are operators of a polluting installation undertake to waive all defences based on sovereignty (art. 13).

Summary of provisions: The Protocol was adopted within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). It is to apply exclusively to pollution damage caused in the territory of a Contracting Party and in its exclusive economic zone, and to preventive measures taken to prevent or minimise such damage (art. II). The owner of a ship is liable for any such pollution damage caused by the ship as a result of an incident (art. III), but he has a right to limit his liability (art. V). Where he avails himself from such a right, the owner of a ship is to constitute a fund to be distributed among the claimants in proportion to the amounts of their established claims. The owner of a ship registered in a State Party and carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo is to maintain insurance to cover his liability under the Convention (art. VII). Contracting States agree not to permit a ship under its flag to trade unless a certificate attesting that such insurance is in force has been issued. Other provisions provide for, inter alia, joint liability (art. IV), time limit of liability (art. VIII), jurisdiction for Courts to entertain actions for compensation under the Convention (art.

Objectives: To amend the 1971 International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damages to provide for improved scope and enhanced compensation. Summary of provisions: The Protocol was adopted in the framework of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Article 2 of the 1971 Fund Convention is amended to establish the 'International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund 1984', inter alia to provide compensation for pollution damage to the extent that the protection afforded by the 1984 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage is inadequate. Article 3 of the 1971 Fund Convention is amended to define a new scope of application, Article 4 is amended, inter alia, to set the amounts of compensation payable by the Fund, and a new paragraph 4 is added to Article 15 to provide for the liability of a Party which has not complied with its obligation under paragraph 2 of the Article, resulting in a financial loss for the Fund. Articles 1 to 36 quater of the 1971 Convention as amended by this Protocol are to be known as the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1984 (1984 Fund Convention). Three new Articles are inserted after Article 36 to set the rules for the transitional period commencing with the date of entry into force of the 1984 Fund Convention and ending with the denunciation of the 1971 Fund Convention. Other amended Articles are Articles 1, 4 to 13, 16, 18, 19, 21 to 27, 29, 31 to 33, and 35. Finally, Parties undertake to communicate annually to the Secretary-General of the IMO information on contributing oil (Art. 29).

Summary of provisions: The Parties agree to control the annual consumption and production of substances named in annex A at the 1986 annual level. Developing countries consuming less than 0.3 kg per capita of the controlled substances, on the entry into force of the Protocol for them, may delay compliance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of article 2 of the Protocol by ten years, provided in that period they do not exceed 0.3 kg per capita (arts. 2 and 5). A year after the entry of the Protocol into force Parties may not import the substances from a non-party to the Protocol. After January 1993 developing countries may not export such substances to a non-party (arts. 4 and 5). The Protocol also provides for measures of exchange of technology and information, calculation of control levels and assessment and review of the progress achieved.

Article 9 recognises the right of a coastal State to take measures in accordance with international law to protect its coastline from pollution or threat of pollution from a casualty or acts related thereto that may lead to harmful consequences. The State may give directions in relation to salvage operations. In making such directions, the State is to take into account the need to ensure the success of the salvage operation in order to save life or property, and preventing damage to the environment in general. Special compensation is payable by the owner of the vessel to a salvor with respect to a vessel that by itself or its cargo threatens to cause environmental damage and if the compensation has not been paid under the normal criteria for fixing reward (arts. 13 and 14).

Summary of provisions: Article 2.1 defines dangerous activity to cover various activities performed professionally and associated with dangerous substances, genetically modified organisms, micro-organisms or wastes (art. 2.1). The Convention imposes liability on the operator of a dangerous activity for the damage caused by the activity as a result of incidents at the time or during the period when he was exercising the control of that activity (art. 6.1) and on the operator of a site for the permanent deposit of waste, at the time when damage caused by waste deposited at that site becomes known (art. 7.1). The Convention exempts the operator from liability for damages in certain circumstances, such as an act of war or natural disaster or pollution at tolerable levels under local relevant circumstances (art. 8). It contains provisions giving due consideration to the fault of the person who suffered the damage, the causal link between the incident and the damage, and circumstances where several installations or several sites are involved in incidents (arts. 9, 10 and 11).
|
Each Party undertakes to ensure that operators conducting a dangerous activity on its territory be required to participate in a financial security scheme or to have and maintain a financial guarantee to cover the 1iability under the Convention (art. 12). The Convention provides a right of public access to information relating to the environment held by public authorities or by bodies with public responsibilities for the environment (arts. 14 and 15). It further enables persons concerned to request the court to order access to specific information held by an operator if this is necessary to establish the existence of a claim for compensation or the extent of an operator's liability (art. 16.1 and 16.2). Actions for compensation and other claims are limited in time (art. 17.2). Non- governmental environmental organizations may request the prohibition of an unlawful dangerous activity posing a grave threat of damage to the environment or seek orders requiring operators to carry out preventative or reinstatement measures (art. 18). Actions for compensation under the Convention may only be brought within a Party at the court of place where the damage was suffered; the dangerous activity was conducted or the defendant has his habitual residence (art. 19.1).
|
Institutional mechanisms: A Standing Committee is established to keep under review problems relating to the Convention (arts. 26 and 27).

Summary of provisions: This Protocol supersedes the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 between Contracting Parties to this Protocol which are also Parties to the Convention (art. 23). Parties undertake to apply a precautionary approach to environmental protection from dumping of wastes or other matter. Each Party is to endeavour to promote practices whereby those it has authorised to engage in dumping or incineration at sea bear the responsibility of meeting the pollution prevention and control requirements. Parties are to act so as not to transfer, directly or indirectly, damage or likelihood of damage from one part of the environment to another or transform one type of pollution into another (art.3). The Protocol prohibits the dumping of any wastes or other matter, with the exception of those listed in Annex I which identifies wastes or other matter that may be considered for dumping or in certain circumstances (arts. 4 (1) and 8). A permit is required for the dumping of wastes and other matter listed in Annex I. Parties agree to adopt administrative or legislative measures to ensure that issuance of permits meet certain conditions (art. 4, Annex 2). Parties are to pay particular attention to opportunities to avoid dumping in favour of environmentally preferable alternatives (art. 4). Incineration at sea of wastes or other matter is prohibited (art. 5), with the exception of securing the safety of human life or vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in emergencies (art.8). Parties undertake not to allow the export of wastes or other matter to other countries for dumping or incineration at sea (art. 6). Each Party is to, at its discretion, either apply the provisions of the protocol or adopt other effective measures to control the deliberate disposal of wastes or other matter in marine international waters where such disposal would be dumping or incineration at sea within the meaning of the definitions of the Protocol, if conducted at sea (art. 7). Finally, each Party undertakes to designate an appropriate authority to issue permits, to keep relevant records and to monitor the condition of the sea for the purpose of the Protocol (art. 9), as well as to provide IMO or other Parties with such records and the findings of the monitoring as well as information on the administrative and legislative measures taken to implement the Protocol (art.9.4).
|
Institutional mechanisms: No later than two years after the entry into force of the Protocol, the Meeting of Contracting Parties is to establish procedures and mechanisms necessary to assess and promote compliance with the Protocol (art. 11).

Summary of provisions: Radioactive waste and spent fuel are defined in article 2. The Convention applies to the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management resulting from the operation of civilian nuclear reactors and civilian applications respectively (art. 3). Each Contracting Party is to take appropriate steps to ensure that individuals, society and the environment are adequately protected against radiological hazards (art. 4 and 11). In so doing, each Contracting Party agrees, inter alia, to provide for effective protection of individuals, society and the environment, strive to avoid actions that impose reasonably predictable impacts on future generations greater than those permitted for the current generation and aim to avoid imposing undue burdens on future generations (art. 4 and 11). Regarding the siting of proposed facilities, each Contracting Party agrees inter alia to evaluate the likely safety impact of such facilities on individuals, society and the environment, to make information on their safety available to members of the public and to consult Contracting Parties in the vicinity of such facilities (art. 6 and 13). Moreover, the Contracting Parties agree to take the appropriate steps to ensure that the design and construction of such facilities provide for suitable measures to limit possible radiological impacts on individuals, society and the environment and take into account technical provisions for decommissioning (art. 7 and 14). Systematic environmental assessments, covering its operating lifetime, and the period following closure in the case of waste, are to be carried out and updated when necessary (art. 8 and 15). If during any period of active institutional control, an unplanned release of radioactive materials into the environment is detected, intervention measures are implemented if necessary (art. 17). Each Contracting Party undertakes to establish and maintain a legislative and regulatory framework and body to govern the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management (art. 19 and 20). Article 27 defines obligations regarding transboundary movement.
|
Institutional mechanisms: A reporting procedure is established by article 32. Meetings of the Parties are established to review the reports submitted by Contracting Parties (art. 30). The International Atomic Energy Agency is to provide secretariat for the meetings of the Contracting Parties (art. 37).

ECE/MP.WAT/11-ECE/CP.TEIA/9;NA;Objectives: To provide for a comprehensive regime for civil liability and for adequate and prompt compensation for damage caused by the transboundary effects of industrial accidents on transboundary waters. Summary of provisions: Article 2 defines the terms covered by the Protocol. Articles 4 and 9 provide for a strict liability of operators (not based on fault and financially limited), and articles 5 and 9 provide for a fault-based liability financially limitless. The operator is to take measures to prevent, minimise or mitigate possible loss or damage, or to arrange for environmental clean-up (art. 6). Persons liable under the Protocol have a right of recourse against any other person also liable under the Protocol (art. 7). Parties undertake to implement the Protocol by adopting all necessary legal measures, co-operating, providing for access to information and access to justice accordingly, and ensuring that their courts possess the necessary competence to entertain claims for compensation (art. 8 and 13). The Protocol also sets financial security with a view to guaranteeing that compensation is paid and time limits of liability (art. 10 and 11). Finally, Parties are to ensure mutual recognition and enforcement of judgements and arbitral awards relating to such liability as established under the Protocol (art. 18). Institutional mechanisms: A Meeting of the Parties is established (art. 21) to, inter alia, review the implementation and compliance with the Protocol, including relevant case law. The Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe is to carry out secretariat functions as provided in article 22. Parties are to inform it of any measures taken to implement the Protocol (art. 8).; www.unece.org/env/civil-liability/welcome.html ;"

ement of ships' ballast water and sediments. Parties are given the right to take, individually or jointly with other Parties, more stringent measures with respect to the prevention, reduction or elimination of the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through the control and management of ships' ballst water and sediments, consistent with international law. Parties should ensure that ballast water management practices do not cause greater harm than they prevent to their environment, human health, property or resources, or those of other States. Reception facilities: Under Article 5 'Sediment Reception Facilities' Parties undertake to ensure that ports and terminals where cleaning or repair of ballast tanks occurs, have adequate reception facilities for the reception of sediments. Research and monitoring: Article 6 'Scientific and Technical Research and Monitoring' calls for Parties individually or jointly to promote and facilitate scientific and technical research on ballast water management; and monitor the effects of ballast water management in waters under their jurisdiction. Survey, certification and inspection: Ships are required to be surveyed and certified (Article 7 'Survey and certification') and may be inspected by port State control officers (Article 9 'Inspection of Ships') who can verify that the ship has a valid certificate; inspect the Ballast Water Record Book; and/or sample the ballast water.

The Treaty establishing the Energy Community brings together the European Union, on one hand, and countries from the South East Europe and Black Sea region. The Energy Community?s mission is to extend the EU internal energy market to South East Europe and beyond on the basis of a legally binding framework. The principal instrument to achieve this aim is the adoption of the EU?s legislation, the so-called ?acquis communautaire?, in energy and related areas. To date, some 25 laws have been incorporated into the Energy Community?s legal framework, covering gas, electricity, security of supply, renewables, oil, energy efficiency, environment, competition and statistics. The Energy Community may also take measures to create a single energy market. (Source: www.energy-community.org);"

The Convention provides a sound legal basis for coastal States to remove, or have removed, from their coastlines, wrecks which pose a hazard to the safety of navigation or to the marine and coastal environments, or both. It will make shipowners financially liable and require them to take out insurance or provide other financial security to cover the costs of wreck removal. It will also provide States with a right of direct action against insurers. Articles in the Convention cover: Reporting and locating ships and wrecks - covering the reporting of casualties to the nearest coastal State; warnings to mariners and coastal States about the wreck; action by the coastal State to locate the ship or wreck; criteria for determining the hazard posed by wrecks, including depth of water above the wreck, proximity of shipping routes, traffic density and frequency, type of traffic and vulnerability of port facilities. Environmental criteria such as damage likely to result from the release into the marine environment of cargo or oil are also included; measures to facilitate the removal of wrecks, including rights and obligations to remove hazardous ships and wrecks - which sets out when the shipowner is responsible for removing the wreck and when a State may intervene; liability of the owner for the costs of locating, marking and removing ships and wrecks - the registered shipowner is required to maintain compulsory insurance or other financial security to cover liability under the convention; settlement of disputes.

The text of the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) outlines principles, rights and obligations for cooperative management and development of the Nile Basin water resources. Rather than quantifying 'equitable rights' or water use allocations, the Treaty intends to establish a framework to ""promote integrated management, sustainable development, and harmonious utilization of the water resources of the Basin, as well as their conservation and protection for the benefit of present and future generations"". For this purpose, the Treaty envisages the establishment of a permanent institutional mechanism, the Nile River Basin Commission (NRBC). The Commission would serve to promote and facilitate the implementation of the CFA and to facilitate cooperation among the Nile Basin States in the conservation, management and development of the Nile River Basin and its waters.
