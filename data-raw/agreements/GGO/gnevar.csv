Parties are to, inter alia, maintain in good order port facilities and the existing twopaths and Rhine channel (art. 28), exchange information and consult on hydro-technic projects and take all necessary steps to ensure that navigation on the Rhine is not obstructed (art. 30). Tribunals are to be established to try cases concerning navigation on the Rhine (art. 33), and the Rhine is to be divided into inspection districts to be surveyed by inspectors yearly (art. 42). Institutional mechanisms: A Central Commission is established to, inter alia, examine all complaints arising from the application of the Convention, render judgement in cases of appeal, and prepare each year a report on the state of the Rhine navigation (art. 45).","PrGS. 1869, p. 798, 836 UK Misc.

The net yield of these projects shall be divided equally between the two Republics and each of them shall also contribute equally to the costs; the Republic of the Sudan shall finance the above-mentioned projects out of its own funds and the United Arab Republic shall pay its share in the costs in the same ratio of 50 percent allotted for her in the yield of these projects; the United Arab Republic shall at the expiry of the two years, start the execution of the projects, at its own expense. And when the Republic of Sudan is ready to utilize its share according to the agreed programme, it shall pay to the United Arab Republic a share of all the expenses in the same ratio as the Sudan's share in benefit is to the total benefit of the projects provided that the share of either Republic shall not exceed one half of the total benefit of the project.

The States undertake to accept safeguards on all sources or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within their territories, under their jurisdiction or carried out under their control anywhere to verify that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (art. 1). Material accountancy is to be used as a safeguard measure of fundamental importance, with containment and surveillance as important complementary measures (art. 29). The safeguards provided in this Agreement are to be implemented in a manner designed to avoid hampering the economic and technological development or international cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, to avoid undue interference in the peaceful nuclear activities of the Community and be consistent with prudent management practices (art. 5). The Agency agrees to take every precaution to protect commercial and industrial secrets and other confidential information (art.6). The Agreement specifies the conditions under which the safeguards apply and what information is to be provided. A reporting system is established (art. 59-69) along with an inspection procedure (art. 70-90). It establishes the conditions under which the transfer into or out of the States is to be the responsibility of the Community (art. 91-97).

It is to apply to ships as defined in Regulations 1 and 2. Parties agree that an International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate (1973) is to be issued after survey in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 3 to any ship which is engaged in voyages to ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of other Parties to the Convention (Regulation 4). No such Certificate is to be issued to a ship entitled to fly the flag of a non-Party State (Regulation 5). Following Regulations deal with the form of the Certificate and with its duration. Parties also agree that the discharge of sewage into the sea is prohibited, except in cases defined in Regulations 8 and 9. Finally, Parties undertake to ensure the provision of facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage, without causing undue delay to ships, and notify the IMO of all cases where the facilities provided are alleged to be inadequate to meet the needs of the ships using them.",, www.imo.org ,International Maritime Organization (IMO),http://iea.uoregon.edu/pages/view_treaty.php?t=1973-PollutionFromShipsAnnexIV.EN.txt&par=view_treaty_html,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, articles 3 sub-paragraph (a), 6 paragraph 1, 7 paragraph 1, 8 paragraph 2 and 18 paragraph 1 of the Convention are replaced by new ones. A new paragraph 3bis is added in article 15 of the Convention providing an option for Parties to determine by specific measures of national legislation a system of liability to be applied to claims for loss of life or personal injury to passengers of a ship, provided that the limit of liability is not lower than that prescribed in the Convention.",BGBl. 2000 II 790, www.imo.org ,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary of provisions: Chapter I defines the terms covered by the Convention and the scope of its application, in respect of damage, claims, and ships. Chapter II concerns liability of the owner of the ship carrying hazardous and noxious substances who is entitled to limit his liability in accordance with art. 9, and is to constitute a fund for the total sum representing the limit of his liability, to be distributed amongst the claimants. Furthermore, the owner is to maintain insurance or other financial security to cover liability for damage under this Convention (art. 12), and is to be issued a compulsory insurance certificate to be allowed to trade under the flag of a Party. Chapter III provides for compensation by the International Hazardous and Noxious Substances Fund (HNS Fund) in cases where persons suffering damage have been unable to obtain full and adequate compensation under the terms of chapter II. Compulsory contributions to the HNS Fund are to be made by shipping industries and people with cargo interests, but State Parties may declare that they assume responsibility for obligations imposed on such persons (art. 23). When such persons do not fulfil the obligations in respect of any such contribution or any part thereof and are in arrears, action, including court action, may be taken against them on behalf of the HNS Fund with a view to recovery of the amount due (art. 22). Chapter IV deals with claims and actions, including prescription of the right to compensation, jurisdiction in respect of action against the owner or against the HNS Fund, and recognition and enforcement of judgements. Institutional mechanisms: The International Hazardous and Noxious Substances Fund (HNS Fund) is established (art. 13). It has an Assembly and a Secretariat, headed by a Director (art. 24).",, www.imo.org/ ,International Maritime Organization (IMO),http://iea.uoregon.edu/pages/view_treaty.php?t=1996-LiabilityCompensationHazardousNoxiousSubstancesSea.EN.txt&par=view_treaty_html,,,3,,,,,,3,

Parties undertake to apply a precautionary approach to environmental protection from dumping of wastes or other matter. Each Party is to endeavour to promote practices whereby those it has authorised to engage in dumping or incineration at sea bear the responsibility of meeting the pollution prevention and control requirements. Parties are to act so as not to transfer, directly or indirectly, damage or likelihood of damage from one part of the environment to another or transform one type of pollution into another (art.3). The Protocol prohibits the dumping of any wastes or other matter, with the exception of those listed in Annex I which identifies wastes or other matter that may be considered for dumping or in certain circumstances (arts. 4 (1) and 8). A permit is required for the dumping of wastes and other matter listed in Annex I. Parties agree to adopt administrative or legislative measures to ensure that issuance of permits meet certain conditions (art. 4, Annex 2). Parties are to pay particular attention to opportunities to avoid dumping in favour of environmentally preferable alternatives (art. 4). Incineration at sea of wastes or other matter is prohibited (art. 5), with the exception of securing the safety of human life or vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in emergencies (art.8). Parties undertake not to allow the export of wastes or other matter to other countries for dumping or incineration at sea (art. 6). Each Party is to, at its discretion, either apply the provisions of the protocol or adopt other effective measures to control the deliberate disposal of wastes or other matter in marine international waters where such disposal would be dumping or incineration at sea within the meaning of the definitions of the Protocol, if conducted at sea (art. 7). Finally, each Party undertakes to designate an appropriate authority to issue permits, to keep relevant records and to monitor the condition of the sea for the purpose of the Protocol (art. 9), as well as to provide IMO or other Parties with such records and the findings of the monitoring as well as information on the administrative and legislative measures taken to implement the Protocol (art.9.4).|Institutional mechanisms: No later than two years after the entry into force of the Protocol, the Meeting of Contracting Parties is to establish procedures and mechanisms necessary to assess and promote compliance with the Protocol (art. 11).|(Source: IUCN ELC, 08.2005, based on UNEP Register of International Treaties and Other Agreements in the Field of the Environment, 1996)",BGBl. 1998 II 1345  |  2001 I 2785, www.imo.org/ ,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary of provisions: The Protocol was adopted in the framework of the Regional Organisation for the Protection of the Marine Environment (ROPME). The Area to which it applies is defined in art. 3. Parties agree, inter alia, to ensure that the generation of hazardous wastes or other wastes is reduced to a minimum, prohibit all persons under their jurisdiction from transporting or disposing of such wastes unless such persons are authorised or allowed, require that when hazardous wastes and other wastes are to be the subject of a transboundary movement they are packaged, labelled and transported in conformity with generally accepted and recognised international rules and standards, ensure the effective control of transport and disposal facilities for such wastes, and require that such wastes, when exported, are managed in an environmentally sound manner in the State of import or elsewhere. Under the Protocol, importation of hazardous wastes and other wastes from non-contracting States is prohibited, except if certain conditions are met (art. 5), disposal of such wastes in the Protocol Area is also prohibited, unless they are destined for operations specified in Annex IV Section B (art. 6), and exportation of hazardous wastes and other wastes to non-contracting States is allowed under certain conditions only (art. 7), as is transboundary movement of such wastes between contracting States (art. 8). Art. 10 deals with illegal traffic, and art. 11 provides for a duty to re-import hazardous wastes and other wastes in certain cases. Institutional mechanisms: The ROPME, established under art.

Summary of provisions: Article 2 defines the terms covered by the Protocol. Articles 4 and 9 provide for a strict liability of operators (not based on fault and financially limited), and articles 5 and 9 provide for a fault-based liability financially limitless. The operator is to take measures to prevent, minimise or mitigate possible loss or damage, or to arrange for environmental clean-up (art. 6). Persons liable under the Protocol have a right of recourse against any other person also liable under the Protocol (art. 7). Parties undertake to implement the Protocol by adopting all necessary legal measures, co-operating, providing for access to information and access to justice accordingly, and ensuring that their courts possess the necessary competence to entertain claims for compensation (art. 8 and 13). The Protocol also sets financial security with a view to guaranteeing that compensation is paid and time limits of liability (art. 10 and 11). Finally, Parties are to ensure mutual recognition and enforcement of judgements and arbitral awards relating to such liability as established under the Protocol (art. 18). Institutional mechanisms: A Meeting of the Parties is established (art. 21) to, inter alia, review the implementation and compliance with the Protocol, including relevant case law. The Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe is to carry out secretariat functions as provided in article 22. Parties are to inform it of any measures taken to implement the Protocol (art. 8).",Doc.

Parties are given the right to take, individually or jointly with other Parties, more stringent measures with respect to the prevention, reduction or elimination of the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through the control and management of ships' ballst water and sediments, consistent with international law. Parties should ensure that ballast water management practices do not cause greater harm than they prevent to their environment, human health, property or resources, or those of other States. Reception facilities: Under Article 5 'Sediment Reception Facilities' Parties undertake to ensure that ports and terminals where cleaning or repair of ballast tanks occurs, have adequate reception facilities for the reception of sediments. Research and monitoring: Article 6 'Scientific and Technical Research and Monitoring' calls for Parties individually or jointly to promote and facilitate scientific and technical research on ballast water management; and monitor the effects of ballast water management in waters under their jurisdiction. Survey, certification and inspection: Ships are required to be surveyed and certified (Article 7 'Survey and certification') and may be inspected by port State control officers (Article 9 'Inspection of Ships') who can verify that the ship has a valid certificate; inspect the Ballast Water Record Book; and/or sample the ballast water. If there are concerns, then a detailed inspection may be carried out and the Party carrying out the inspection shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship shall not discharge Ballast Water until it can do so without presenting a threat of harm to the environment, human health, property or resources. All possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed (Article 12 'Undue Delay to Ships'). Technical assistance: Under Article 13 'Technical Assistance, Co-operation and Regional Co-operation', Parties undertake, directly or through tje Organization and other international bodies, as appropriate, in respect of the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments, to provide support for those Parties which request technical assistance to train personnel; to ensure the availability of relevant technology, equipment and facilities; to initiate joint research and development programmes; and to undertake other action aimed at the effective implementation of this Convention and of guidance developed by the Organization related thereto.",, www.imo.org/ ,International Maritime Organization (IMO),http://iea.uoregon.edu/pages/view_treaty.php?t=2004-ShipsBallastWater.EN.txt&par=view_treaty_html,,,,,,,,,,

The principal instrument to achieve this aim is the adoption of the EU’s legislation, the so-called “acquis communautaire”, in energy and related areas. To date, some 25 laws have been incorporated into the Energy Community’s legal framework, covering gas, electricity, security of supply, renewables, oil, energy efficiency, environment, competition and statistics.
