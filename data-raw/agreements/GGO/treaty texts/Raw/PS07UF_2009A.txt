state measures;acknowledging further that the text of the draft agreement was finalized on 28 august 2009 by the technical consultation to draft a legally-binding instrument on port state measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing;having considered the report of the eighty-eighth session of the committee on constitutional and legal matters held in

agreement,deeply concerned about the continuation of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and its detrimental effect upon fish stocks, marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of legitimate fishers, and the increasing need for food security on a global basis,conscious of the role of the port state in the adoption of effective measures to promote the sustainable use and the long-term conservation of living marine resources,recognizing that measures to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing should build on the primary responsibility of flag states and use all available jurisdiction in accordance with international law, including port state measures, coastal state measures, market related measures and measures to ensure that nationals do not support or engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,recognizing that port state measures provide a powerful and cost-effective means of preventing, deterring and eliminating illegal, unreported and

measures, based on the 2001 fao international plan of action to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the 2005 fao model scheme on port state measures to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,bearing in mind that, in the exercise of their sovereignty over ports located in their territory, states may adopt more stringent measures, in accordance
