Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the CSCE Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe,

Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the rule of law, human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities, and fundamental freedoms, and recalling their membership in the Council of Europe,

Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution.
3.	
(a)	As regards Articles 17 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings) and 18 (State aid), the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to.

Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. The measures taken by Lithuania against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Lithuania may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission.
5.	The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.
6.	Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 19 (Dumping), 20 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage) and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.

Appendix I to protocol B
Introductory notes to the list in Appendix II
This Appendix is based on the 1992 version of the HS Nomenclature. It will be adjusted to the 2nd revision of the HS (HS version 1996) by the entry into force of this Agreement by a Joint Committee decision.
APPENDIX I TO PROTOCOL B
Introductory notes to the list in Appendix II
Note 1:
The list sets out for all products covered by this Agreement the conditions required for these products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5(1) of this Protocol.
Note 2:
2.1
The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an Â«exÂ», this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading or chapter as described in column 2.


2.2
Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.


2.3
Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.


2.4
Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.

Note 3:
3.1
The provisions of Article 5(1) of this Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used, in another factory in the same State or in another State Party to this Agreement.
 

Example:
An engine of heading No. 84.07, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40% of the ex-works price, is made from other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging of heading No. ex 72.24.
If this forging has been forged in a State Party to this Agreement from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No. ex 72.24 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory, in another factory in the same State or in another State Party to this Agreement. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.
3.2
The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.


3.3
When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.
 

Example:
The rule for fabrics of ex Chapter 50 to Chapter 55 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.
3.4
Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).
 

Example:
The rule for prepared foods of heading No. 19.04 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not produced from cereals.
However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular material specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.
 
Example:
In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn that is the fibre stage.
3.5
Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.

Note 4:
4.1
The term Â«natural fibresÂ» is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.


4.2
The term Â«natural fibresÂ» includes horsehair of heading No. 05.03, silk of heading Nos. 50.02 and 50.03 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos. 51.01 to 51.05, the cotton fibres of heading Nos. 52.01 to 52.03 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos. 53.01 to 53.05.


4.3
The terms Â«textile pulpÂ», Â«chemical materialsÂ» and Â«paper-making materialsÂ» are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.


4.4
The term Â«man-made staple fibresÂ» is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos. 55.01 to 55.07.

Note 5:
5.1
Where for a given product in the List a reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10% or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).


5.2
However, this tolerance may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:
silk,
wool,
coarse animal hair,
fine animal hair,
horsehair,
cotton,
paper-making materials and paper,
flax,
true hemp,
jute and other textile bast fibres,
sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,
coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,
synthetic man-made filaments
artificial man-made filaments
synthetic man-made staple fibres,
artificial man-made staple fibres.
 
Example:
A yarn of heading No. 52.05 made from cotton fibres of heading No. 52.03 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No. 55.06 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, nonoriginating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10% of the yarn.
 
Example:
A woollen fabric of heading No. 51.12 made from woollen yarn of heading No. 51.07 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No. 55.09 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the fabric.
 
Example:
Tufted textile fabric of heading No. 58.02 made from cotton yarn of heading No. 52.05 and cotton fabric of heading No. 52.10 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.
 
Example:
If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No. 52.05 and synthetic fabric of heading No. 54.07, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.
 
Example:
A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the textiles materials of the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.
5.3
In the case of products incorporating yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20% in respect of this yarn.


5.4
In the case of products incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two films of plastic film, this tolerance is 30% in respect of this strip.

Note 6
6.1
In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exce
ed 8% of the ex- works price of the product.


6.2
Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely, whether or not they contain textiles.
 

Example:
If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slidefasteners normally contain textiles.
6.3
Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within chapter 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

Annex VI
On the interpretation of article 18
The EFTA States and Lithuania agree that the application of Article 18 shall be guided by the following criteria:
(a)
Only those measures can be classified as State aid which result in a net transfer of funds from State sources to the recipient through direct subsidies or which result in tax revenues foregone through tax concession; aid granted under schemes which are fully paid for by the beneficiaries are not State aid in the sense of Article 18; when assessing effects of State aid, the cumulative effects of all types of aid measures awarded to recipients are to be taken into consideration.


(b)
The following measures, in general fall outside, the scope of Article 18:


(i)
credits and loans from State sources or agencies, if the interest and capital repayments are in accordance with current market conditions;


(ii)
guarantees given by States or State agencies, if the premiums cover the long-term cost of the scheme;


(iii)
equity injections by States or State agencies if the rate of return on such investments can reasonably be expected to be at least equal to the cost of State borrowing;


(iv)
tax measures including social security charges that are part of the general national income norm for tax purposes, available to all enterprises, and uniformly applied in a country.


(c)
The following measures are examples of types of aid normally consistent with the provisions of Article 18:


(i)
aid to research, development and innovation, provided it is clearly intended for the stimulation of such activities and that such activities are at a precompetitive level; the pre-competitive level is understood to include applied research and development up to and including the development of a first prototype; such aid may be awarded up to a rate of 50 per cent of project costs or at differentiated tax rates of equivalent effect; basic research may be aided to a greater extent; the closer to the market place a project is, the lower the degree of subsidizations should be;


(ii)
aid given to sectors with problems of overcapacity to rationalize the structure of industry by ensuring an orderly downscaling of production and employment; such measures should strictly be limited in duration and be accompanied by an adjustment programme; when evaluating problems of overcapacity the international situation as a whole and not merely in the country in question is to be taken into account;


(iii)
general aid to export promotion such as national weeks, store promotion, industrial fairs, provided that such aid is not company-specific;


(iv)
regional development aid to the extent that it does not interfere with conditions of fair competition; its purpose must be to put industries in regional development areas on an equal economic footing with industries in other parts of the country and not to increase capacity in sectors already suffering from problems of overcapacity; the definition of regional development areas, including areas in industrial decline, lies within the sole competence of the State Parties to this Agreement, which may be requested to furnish statistics detailing the reasons for the designation of such areas;


(v)
the aid in form of general public services to trade and industry on terms and conditions not favouring certain sectors and enterprises;


(vi)
general aid for the creation of new employment opportunities provided such jobs are not in sectors already suffering from overcapacity;


(vii)
environmental aid, under the general principle that the polluter-paysprinciple is observed; investment specifically designated to reduce pollution may be aided up to a rate of 25 per cent or at differentiated tax rates of equivalent effect; recognizing the existence of different qualities of legislation or standards in other countries and their potential impact on trade and competition, the degree of subsidizations for specific industries shall be kept under constant review;


(viii)
aid to small and medium-sized enterprises if intended to offset disadvantages directly linked to the size of the firm in question, such enterprises being understood as employing not more than 100 people and having an annual turnover of less than 10 million ECUs.


(d)
The following measures are examples of types of aid normally not consistent with Article 18:


(i)
aid to set against operating losses of enterprises, either directly or through the foregoing of payments due to public authorities;


(ii)
the injection of equity capital in firms if it has the same effect as to set aid against operating losses;


(iii)
aid to production in problem sectors suffering from structural overcapacity or to enterprises in difficulties if not accompanied by an adjustment programme and strictly limited in duration;


(iv)
aid given as a rescue measure to specific firms if not given merely to provide time for the development of longterm solutions and to avoid acute social problems;


(v)
aid measures, including indirect taxes, that are applied in such a way as to discriminate in favour of domestically produced goods and against like goods produced in another State Party to this Agreement;


(vi)
the forms of aid to exports of goods to other State Parties to this Agreement as described in the Appendix.

APPENDIX TO ANNEX VI
ILLUSTRATIVE LIST OF FORMS OF EXPORT AID REFERRED TO IN ANNEX VI (d) (vi)
(a)
Currency retention schemes or any similar practices which involve a bonus on exports or re-exports.


(b)
The provision by governments of direct subsidies to exporters.


(c)
The remission, calculated in relation to exports, of direct taxes or social welfare charges on industrial or commercial enterprises.


(d)
The exemption, in respect of exported goods, from charges or taxes, other than charges in connection with importation or indirect taxes levied at one or several stages on the same goods if sold for internal consumption, or the payment, in respect of exported goods, of amounts exceeding those effectively levied at one or several stages on these goods in the form of indirect taxes or of charges in connection with importation or in both forms.


(e)
In respect of deliveries by governments or governmental agencies of imported raw materials for export business on different terms than for domestic business, the charging of prices below world prices.


(f)
In respect of government export credit guarantees, the charging of premiums at rates which are manifestly inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the credit insurance institutions.


(g)
The grant by governments (or special institutions controlled by governments) of export credits at rates below those which they have to pay in order to obtain the funds so employed.


(h)
The government bearing all or part of the costs incurred by exporters in obtaining credit.

Annex VII
Rules for the implementation of article 18(3) of the agreement between the EFTA States and Lithuania
 
I. ANNUAL REPORTING
1.
The EFTA States and Lithuania shall provide each other annually with complete data concerning the past State aid measures. The EFTA States may provide this information jointly.


2.
The reports, covering aid by central and regional governments, shall contain information on aid by main categories, supplemented by data on main aid schemes and forms of aid used under each such category.


3.
The report has to be submitted to the other party within one year following the fiscal year concerned. The first reports will cover the fiscal year 1996.


4.
The calculation of the net costs of aid measures shall be made in accordance with the methodology described in Appendix 1.


5.
To the extent that certain measures are the result of laws or regulations passed at an earlier stage, the date relating to the receipt of the aid is the date on which it is received by the business enterprise concerned, not the date on which it is budgeted or paid into the funds of an intermediate agency.
 

II. PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFICATION OF NEW AID SCHEMES
6.
With regard to the planned aid measures the State Parties to this Agreement shall provide data on suggested aid schemes or significant amendments of existing aid schemes as early as possible, and in any case not later than 60 days after the date of implementation of the measures in question, with the view to achieving as much transparency as possible.


7.
The comprehensive notifications of new aid measures shall start as from the entry into force of this Agreement and shall be done in English by using the structure of the form reproduced at Appendix 2.


8.
The notification shall be sent to the EFTA Secretariat who will forward it to Lithuania in the case of a notification made by an EFTA State and to all the EFTA States in the case of a notification made by Lithuania.


9.
Each EFTA State shall have the right to request for further information on a measure proposed by Lithuania as well as to comment upon it. Lithuania shall have the same right as regards a measure proposed by an EFTA State. Such requests for information and comments as well as replies to them shall be sent to the EFTA Secretariat who will forward them to the State Party concerned as well as copies of the documents to other State Parties for information. A request for information or a comment made on a proposed aid scheme shall not prevent the initiation of consultations or any further steps of procedure under Article 25 of this Agreement.
 

III. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
10.
In addition to the right to request further information on notified aid schemes the EFTA States have an obligation to provide upon the request of Lithuania information on any other aid schemes and individual cases. Lithuania has the same obligation towards the EFTA States. The procedure provided in paragraph 9 above applies to these requests.
 

IV. OTHER PROVISIONS
11.
These procedures will be reviewed by the Joint Committee before the end of the year 1997 in the light of any relevant developments and experiences on the functioning of the system.

APPENDIX 1
TO ANNEX VII
CALCULATION OF NET COSTS OF AID MEASURES
The net cost of grants is the amount actually paid out in any year. If some previously extended grants are reconverted and partially or fully paid back, the amount is deducted.
The net cost of loans is calculated by computing the (imputed) interest on loans outstanding during the year. The rate of interest used is the average cost of government borrowing for new loans in the year concerned, not the rate over the years over which the loans have already run. The amount of interest received by the public authorities is subtracted. Possible depreciations in the value of loans (write-offs) are added to the net costs.
The net cost of guarantees is equal to the cost of guarantees met in any one year, minus the fees received in that year and minus recoveries.
The net cost of equity is the difference between the cost of government borrowing and any dividends and/or repayments received. Reductions in the value of equity capital (e.g. write-offs) are added as a cost.
