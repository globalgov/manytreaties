treaty between uruguay and argentina concerning the rio de la plata and the corresponding maritime boundarythe governments of the eastern republic of uruguay and the argentine

la plata of 1961 and the rio de la plata protocol of 1964,motivated also by the common desire to remove the difficulties which might arise from any absence of precise legislation with regard to the exercise of their equal rights over the rio de la plata and from the failure to define the limit between their respective maritime jurisdictions, anddetermined to lay the bases for broader co-operation between the two countries and strengthen the close bonds of traditional friendship and deep affection that join their peoples,have decided to conclude a treaty which will resolve these issues once and for all according to the special characteristics of the river and maritime territories involved and the technical requirements of their full use and exploitation, within the context of respect for the sovereignty and respective rights and interests of the two states.for this purpose they have appointed as their plenipotentiaries: the eastern republic of uruguay: dr. juan carlos
