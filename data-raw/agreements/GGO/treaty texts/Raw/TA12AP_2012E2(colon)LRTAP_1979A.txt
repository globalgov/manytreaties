values for emissions of vocs from stationary sources provides guidance on carrying out a solvent management plan. it identifies the principles to be applied (paragraph 2), provides a framework for the mass balance (paragraph 3) and provides an indication of the requirements for verification of compliance (paragraph 4).principles2. the solvent management plan serves the following purposes:(a) verification of compliance, as specified in the annex; and(b) identification of future reduction options.definitions3. the following definitions provide a framework for the mass balance exercise:(a) inputs of organic solvents:- i1 the quantity of organic solvents or their quantity in preparations purchased that are used as input into the process in the time frame over which the mass balance is being calculated;- i2 the quantity of organic solvents or their quantity in preparations recovered and reused as solvent input into the process. (the recycled solvent is counted every time it is used to carry out the activity.).-(b) outputs of organic solvents:- o1. emission of vocs in waste gases;- o2. organic solvents lost in water, if appropriate taking into account wastewater treatment when calculating o5;- o3. the quantity of organic solvents that remains as contamination or residue in output of products from the process;- o4. uncaptured emissions of organic solvents to air. this includes the general ventilation of rooms, where air is released to the outside environment via windows, doors, vents and similar openings;- o5. organic solvents and/or organic compounds lost due to chemical or physical reactions (including, for example, those that are destroyed, e.g., by incineration or other waste-gas or wastewater, or captured, e.g., by adsorption, as long as they are not counted under o6, o7 or o8);- o6. organic solvents contained in collected waste;- o7. organic solvents, or organic solvents contained in preparations, that are sold or are intended to be sold as a commercially valuable product;- o8. organic solvents contained in preparations recovered for reuse but not as input into the process, as long as they are not counted under o7;- o9. organic solvents released in other ways.guidance on use of the solvent management plan for verification of compliance4. the use of the solvent management plan will be determined by the particular requirement which is to be verified, as follows:(a) verification of compliance with the reduction option mentioned in paragraph 6 (a) of the annex, with a total limit value expressed in solvent emissions per unit product, or as otherwise stated in the annex:(i) for all activities using the reduction option mentioned in paragraph 6(a) of the annex, the solvent management plan should be put into effect annually to determine consumption. consumption can be calculated by means of the following equation:c = i1 - o8a parallel exercise should also be undertaken to determine solids used in coating in order to derive the annual reference emission and the target emission each year;(ii) for assessing compliance with a total limit value expressed in solvent emissions per unit product or as otherwise stated in the annex, the solvent management plan should be put into effect annually to determine emission of vocs. emission of vocs can be calculated by means of the following equation:e = f + o1where f is the fugitive emission of voc as defined in subparagraph (b) (i) below. the emission figure should be divided by the relevant product parameter;(b) determination of fugitive emission of vocs for comparison with fugitive emission values in the annex:(i) methodology: the fugitive emission of voc can be calculated by means of the following equation:f = i1 - o1 - o5 -o6 - o7 - o8orf = o2 + o3 + o4 + o9this quantity can be determined by direct measurement of the quantities. alternatively, an equivalent calculation can be made by other means, for instance by using the capture efficiency of the process. the fugitive emission value is expressed as a proportion of the input, which can be calculated by means of the following equation:i = i1 + i2;(ii) frequency: fugitive emission of vocs can be determined by a short but comprehensive set of measurements. this need not to be done again until the equipment is modified.t ANNEX viifor annex vii there is substituted the following:timescales under article 31. the timescales for the application of the limit values referred to in article 3, paragraphs 2 and 3, shall be:(a) for new stationary sources, one year after the date of entry into force of the present protocol for the party in question;
