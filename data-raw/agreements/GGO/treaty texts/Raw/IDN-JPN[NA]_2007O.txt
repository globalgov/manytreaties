 (d) No bilateral safeguard measure shall be
maintained except to the extent and for such time
as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious
injury and to facilitate adjustment, provided
that such time shall not exceed a period of four
years. However, in very exceptional
circumstances, a bilateral safeguard measure may
be extended, provided that the total period of
the bilateral safeguard measure, including such
extensions, shall not exceed five years. In

compensation within 30 days after the
commencement of the consultation pursuant to
subparagraph 4(c), the Party against whose
originating good the bilateral safeguard measure
is taken shall be free to suspend the application
of concessions of customs duties under this
Agreement, which are substantially equivalent to
the bilateral safeguard measure. The Party
exercising the right of suspension may suspend
the application of concessions of customs duties
only for the minimum period necessary to achieve
the substantially equivalent effects and only
while the bilateral safeguard measure is
maintained.
6. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from
applying safeguard measures to an originating good in
accordance with:

there is clear evidence that increased imports of
an originating good have caused or are
threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic
industry.

bilateral safeguard measure. Consultations
between the Parties on the application of the

safeguard measure shall not exceed 200 days.
During that period, the pertinent requirements of
paragraph 3 shall be met. The duration of the
provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be
counted as a part of the period referred to in
subparagraph 4(d).
 (d) Subparagraph 4(f) and paragraphs 7 and 8 shall be
applied mutatis mutandis to the provisional
bilateral safeguard measure. The customs duty
imposed as a result of the provisional bilateral
safeguard measure shall be refunded if the
subsequent investigation referred to in
subparagraph 3(a) does not determine that
increased imports of the originating good have
caused or threatened to cause serious injury to a
domestic industry.
10. Written notice referred to in subparagraphs 4(a) and
9(b) and any other communication between the Parties shall
be done in the English language.
11. The Parties shall review the provisions of this
Article, if necessary, five years after the date of entry

investments.
2. An investment dispute shall, as far as possible, be
settled amicably through consultation or negotiation

dispute (hereinafter referred to in this Article as

judicial settlement within the disputing Party in
accordance with the laws and regulations of the disputing
Party.

consultation or negotiation referred to in paragraph 2
within five months from the date on which the disputing
investor requested for the consultation or negotiation in
writing and if the disputing investor has not submitted the
investment dispute for resolution under courts of justice
or administrative tribunals or agencies, the disputing
investor may submit the investment dispute to one of the
following international conciliations or arbitrations:
 (a) conciliation or arbitration in accordance with
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Dispute between States and Nationals of Other
States(hereinafter referred to in this Article as
“the ICSID Convention”), so long as the ICSID
Convention is in force between the Parties;

knowledge that the disputing investor had incurred loss or
damage referred to in paragraph 1.
9. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, the disputing investor
may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim
injunctive relief that does not involve the payment of
damages before an administrative tribunal or agency or a
court of justice under the law of the disputing Party.
10. Unless the disputing investor and the disputing Party
(hereinafter referred to in this Article as “the disputing
parties”) agree otherwise, an arbitral tribunal established
under paragraph 4 shall comprise three arbitrators, one
arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and
the third, who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed
by agreement of the disputing parties. If the disputing
investor or the disputing Party fails to appoint an
arbitrator or arbitrators within 60 days from the date on
which the investment dispute was submitted to arbitration,
the Secretary-General of the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to
in this Article as “ICSID”), may be requested by either of
the disputing parties, to appoint the arbitrator or
arbitrators not yet appointed from the ICSID Panel of
Arbitrators subject to the requirements of paragraphs 11

third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Party,

which is not the disputing Party may make submissions to
the arbitral tribunal on a question of interpretation of
this Agreement.

protection to preserve the rights of the disputing
investor, or to facilitate the conduct of arbitral
proceedings, including an order to preserve evidence in the

compensate for any inherent competitive
disadvantages which result from the foreign
character of the relevant services or service
suppliers.

commitments are undertaken in Annex 8 and which are
indicated with “SS”, any terms, limitations, conditions and
qualifications, referred to in subparagraphs 1(a) and (b),

which are in effect on the date of entry into force of this
Agreement.

Authorization, Licensing or Qualification
 With a view to ensuring that any measure by a Party
relating to the authorization, licensing or qualification
of service suppliers of the other Party does not constitute
an unnecessary barrier to trade in services, each Party
shall endeavor to ensure that such measure:
 (a) is based on objective and transparent criteria,
such as the competence and ability to supply
services;
 (b) is not more burdensome than necessary to ensure
the quality of services; and
 (c) does not constitute a disguised restriction on
the supply of services.
Article 84
Mutual Recognition
1. A Party may recognize the education or experience
obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications
granted in the other Party for the purposes of the
fulfillment, in whole or in part, of its standards or
criteria for the authorization, licensing or certification
of service suppliers of the other Party.
2. Recognition referred to in paragraph 1, which may be
achieved through harmonization or otherwise, may be based
upon an agreement or arrangement between the Parties or may
be accorded unilaterally.
3. Where a Party recognizes, by agreement or arrangement
between the Party and a non-Party or unilaterally, the
education or experience obtained, requirements met or
licenses or certifications granted in the non-Party: 
74
 (a) nothing in Article 82 shall be construed to
require the Party to accord such recognition to
the education or experience obtained,
requirements met or licenses or certifications
granted in the other Party; and

adequate opportunity to demonstrate that the
education or experience obtained, requirements
met or licenses or certifications granted in the

transparency and shall not be construed to affect
any rights and obligations of the Parties under this
Chapter.
Article 86
Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of
a service in its Area does not, in the supply of the
monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner
inconsistent with the Party’s commitments under this
Chapter.
2. Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either
directly or through an affiliated juridical person, in the
supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly
rights and which is subject to that Party’s specific
commitments, the Party shall ensure that such a supplier
does not abuse its monopoly position to act in the Area of
the Party in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.
