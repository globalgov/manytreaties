alternatively to paragraphs 6 and either 7 or 8, ships shall comply with the accidental oil fuel outflow performance standard specified below:.1 the level of protection against oil fuel pollution in the event of collision or grounding shall be assessed on the basis of the mean oil outflow parameter as follows:om 0.0157-1.14e-6·c600 m3 = c 5,000 m3om 0.010c = 5,000 m3whereom = mean oil outflow parameter;c = total oil fuel volume..2 the following general assumption shall apply when calculating the mean oil outflow parameter:.1 the ship shall be assumed loaded to the partial load line draught dp without trim or heel;.2 all oil fuel tanks shall be assumed loaded to 98% of their volumetric capacity;.3 the nominal density of the oil fuel (?n) shall generally be taken as 1,000 kg/m3. if the density of the oil fuel is specifically restricted to a lesser value, the lesser value may be applied; and.4 for the purpose of these outflow calculations, the permeability of each oil fuel tank shall be taken as 0.99, unless proven otherwise..3 the following assumptions shall be used when combining the oil outflow parameters:.1 the mean oil outflow shall be calculated independently for side damage and for bottom damage and then combined into a non-dimensional oil outflow parameter om, as follows:om = (0.4 oms + 0.6 omb) / cwhere:oms = mean outflow for side damage, in m3omb = mean outflow for bottom damage, in m3c = total oil fuel volume..2 for bottom damage, independent calculations for mean outflow shall be done for 0 m and 2.5 m tide conditions, and then combined as follows:omb = 0.7 omb(0) + 0.3 omb(2.5)where:omb(0) = mean outflow for 0 m tide condition, andomb(2.5) = mean outflow for minus 2.5 m tide condition, in m3..4 the mean outflow for side damage oms shall be calculated as follows:[editor's note: equation removed, refer to page 7 of original document]where:i = represents each oil fuel tank under consideration;n = total number of oil fuel tanks;ps(i) = the probability of penetrating oil fuel tank i from side damage, calculated in accordance with paragraph 11.6 of this regulation;os(i) = the outflow, in m3, from side damage to oil fuel tank i, which is assumed equal to the total volume in oil fuel tank i at 98% filling..5the mean outflow for bottom damage shall be calculated for each tidal condition as follows:[editor's note: equation removed, refer to page 8 of

assumptions:.1 the ship shall be assumed stranded with zero trim and heel, with the stranded draught prior to tidal change equal to the partial load line draught dp..2 the oil fuel level after damage shall be calculated as follows:hf = {(dp + tc-zl)(?s) }/?nwhere:hf = the height of the oil fuel surface above zl, in m;tc = the tidal change, in m. reductions in tide shall be expressed as negative values;zl = the height of the lowest point in the oil fuel tank above the baseline, in m;?s = density of seawater, to be taken as 1,025 kg/m3; and,?n = nominal density of the oil fuel, as defined in 11.2.3..3 the oil outflow ob(i) for any tank bounding the bottom shell plating shall be taken not less than the following formula, but no more than the tank capacity:ob(i) = (hw)(a)where:hw = 1.0 m, when yb = 0hw = bb/50 but not greater than 0.4 m, when yb is greater than bb/5 or 11.5 m, whichever is less"hw" is to be measured upwards from the midship flat bottom line. in the turn of the bilge area and at locations without a clearly defined turn of the bilge, hw is to be measured from a line parallel to the midship flat bottom, as shown for distance "h" in figure 1.for yb values outboard bb/5 or 11.5 m, whichever is less, hw is to be linearly interpolated.yb = the minimum value of yb over the length of the oil fuel tank, where at any given location, yb is the transverse distance between the side shell at waterline db and the tank at or below waterline db.a = the maximum horizontal projected area of the oil fuel tank up to the level of hw from the bottom of the tank.[editor's note: graphic removed, refer to page 9 of original document]figure 3 - dimensions for calculation of the minimum oil outflow for the purpose of subparagraph 11.5.3.3.4 in the case of bottom damage, a portion from the outflow from an oil fuel tank may be captured by non-oil compartments. this effect is approximated by application of the factor cdb(i) for each tank, which shall be taken as follows:cdb(i) = 0.6 for oil fuel tanks bounded from below by non-oil compartments;cdb(i) = 1 otherwise..6 the probability ps of breaching a compartment from side damage shall be calculated as follows:.1 ps = psl . psv . pstwhere:psl = (1 - psf - psa) = probability the damage will extend into the longitudinal zone bounded by xa and xf;psv = (1 - psu - psl) = probability the damage will extend into the vertical zone bounded by zl and zu;pst = (1 - psy) = probability the damage will extend transversely beyond the boundary defined by y;.2 psa, psf, psu and psl shall be determined by linear interpolation from the table of probabilities for side damage provided in 11.6.3, and psy shall be calculated from the formulas provided in 11.6.3, where:psa = the probability the damage will lie entirely aft of location xa/l; psf = the probability the damage will lie entirely forward of location xf/l;psl = probability the damage will lie entirely below the tank;psu = probability the damage will lie entirely above the tank; andpsy = probability the damage will lie entirely outboard the tank.compartment boundaries xa, xf, zl, zu and y shall be developed as follows:xa = the longitudinal distance from aft terminal of l to the aft most point on the compartment being considered, in m;xf = the longitudinal distance from aft terminal of l to the foremost point on the compartment being considered, in m;zl = the vertical distance from the moulded baseline to the lowest point on the compartment being considered, in m. where zl is greater than ds, zl shall be taken as ds;zu = the vertical distance from the moulded baseline to the highest point on the compartment being considered, in m. where zu is greater than ds, zu shall be taken as ds; and,y = the minimum horizontal distance measured at right angles to the centreline between the compartment under consideration and the side shell, in m.
