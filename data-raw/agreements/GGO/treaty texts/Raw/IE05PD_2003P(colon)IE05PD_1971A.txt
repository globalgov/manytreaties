protocol of 2003 to the international convention on the establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage, 1992source: the contracting states to the present protocol,bearing in mind the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage, 1992 (hereinafter "the 1992 liability convention"),having considered the international convention on the establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage, 1992 (hereinafter "the 1992 fund convention"),affirming the importance of maintaining the viability of the international oil pollution liability and compensation system,noting that the maximum compensation afforded by the 1992 fund convention might be insufficient to meet compensation needs in certain circumstances in some contracting states to that convention,recognizing that a number of contracting states to the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions consider it necessary as a matter of urgency to make available additional funds for compensation through the creation of a supplementary scheme to which states may accede if they so wish,believing that the supplementary scheme should seek to ensure that victims of oil pollution damage are compensated in full for their loss or damage and should also alleviate the difficulties faced by victims in cases where there is a risk that the amount of compensation available under the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions will be insufficient to pay established claims in full and that as a consequence the international oil pollution compensation fund, 1992, has decided provisionally that it will pay only a proportion of any established claim,considering that accession to the supplementary scheme will be open only to contracting states to the 1992 fund convention,have agreed as follows:general provisions ARTICLE 1for the purposes of this protocol:1 "1992 liability convention" means the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage, 1992;2 "1992 fund convention" means the international convention on the establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage, 1992;3 "1992 fund" means the international oil pollution compensation fund, 1992, established under the 1992 fund convention;4 "contracting state" means a contracting state to this protocol, unless stated otherwise;5 when provisions of the 1992 fund convention are incorporated by reference into this protocol, "fund" in that convention means "supplementary fund", unless stated otherwise;6 "ship", "person", "owner", "oil", "pollution damage", "preventive measures" and "incident" have the same meaning as in article i of the 1992 liability convention;7 "contributing oil", "unit of account", "ton", "guarantor" and "terminal installation" have the same meaning as in article 1 of the 1992 fund convention, unless stated otherwise;8 "established claim" means a claim which has been recognised by the 1992 fund or been accepted as admissible by decision of a competent court binding upon the 1992 fund not subject to ordinary forms of review and which would have been fully compensated if the limit set out in article 4, paragraph 4, of the 1992 fund convention had not been applied to that incident;9 "assembly" means the assembly of the international oil pollution compensation supplementary fund, 2003, unless otherwise indicated;10 "organization" means the international maritime organization;11 "secretary-general" means the secretary-general of the organization ARTICLE 21 an international supplementary fund for compensation for pollution damage, to be named "the international oil pollution compensation supplementary fund, 2003" (hereinafter "the supplementary fund"), is hereby established.2 the supplementary fund shall in each contracting state be recognized as a legal person capable under the laws of that state of assuming rights and obligations and of being a party in legal proceedings before the courts of that state. each contracting state shall recognize the director of the supplementary fund as the legal representative of the supplementary fund ARTICLE 3this protocol shall apply exclusively:(a) to pollution damage caused:(i) in the territory, including the territorial sea, of a contracting state, and(ii) in the exclusive economic zone of a contracting state, established in accordance with international law, or, if a contracting state has not established such a zone, in an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea of that state determined by that state in accordance with international law and extending not more than 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured;(b) to preventive measures, wherever taken, to prevent or minimize such damage.supplementary compensation ARTICLE 41 the supplementary fund shall pay compensation to any person suffering pollution damage if such person has been unable to obtain full and adequate compensation for an established claim for such damage under the terms of the 1992 fund convention, because the total damage exceeds, or there is a risk that it will exceed, the applicable limit of compensation laid down in article 4, paragraph 4, of the 1992 fund convention in respect of any one incident.2 (a) the aggregate amount of compensation payable by the supplementary fund under this article shall in respect of any one incident be limited, so that the total sum of that amount together with the amount of compensation actually paid under the 1992 liability convention and the 1992 fund convention within the scope of application of this protocol shall not exceed 750 million units of account.(b) the amount of 750 million units of account mentioned in paragraph 2(a) shall be converted into national currency on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the special drawing right on the date determined by the assembly of the 1992 fund for conversion of the maximum amount payable under the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions.3 where the amount of established claims against the supplementary fund exceeds the aggregate amount of compensation payable under paragraph 2, the amount available shall be distributed in such a manner that the proportion between any established claim and the amount of compensation actually recovered by the claimant under this protocol shall be the same for all claimants.4 the supplementary fund shall pay compensation in respect of established claims as defined in article 1, paragraph 8, and only in respect of such claims ARTICLE 5the supplementary fund shall pay compensation when the assembly of the 1992 fund has considered that the total amount of the established claims exceeds, or there is a risk that the total amount of established claims will exceed the aggregate amount of compensation available under article 4, paragraph 4, of the 1992 fund convention and that as a consequence the assembly of the 1992 fund has decided provisionally or finally that payments will only be made for a proportion of any established claim. the assembly of the supplementary fund shall then decide whether and to what extent the supplementary fund shall pay the proportion of any established claim not paid under the 1992 liability convention and the 1992 fund convention ARTICLE 61 subject to article 15, paragraphs 2 and 3, rights to compensation against the supplementary fund shall be extinguished only if they are extinguished against the 1992 fund under article 6 of the 1992 fund convention.2 a claim made against the 1992 fund shall be regarded as a claim made by the same claimant against the supplementary fund ARTICLE 71 the provisions of article 7, paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, of the 1992 fund convention shall apply to actions for compensation brought against the supplementary fund in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of this protocol.2 where an action for compensation for pollution damage has been brought before a court competent under article ix of the 1992 liability convention against the owner of a ship or his guarantor, such court shall have exclusive jurisdictional competence over any action against the supplementary fund for compensation under the provisions of article 4 of this protocol in respect of the same damage. however, where an action for compensation for pollution damage under the 1992 liability convention has been brought before a court in a contracting state to the 1992 liability convention but not to this protocol, any action against the supplementary fund under article 4 of this protocol shall at the option of the claimant be brought either before a court of the state where the supplementary fund has its headquarters or before any court of a contracting state to this protocol competent under article ix of the 1992 liability convention.3 notwithstanding paragraph 1, where an action for compensation for pollution damage against the 1992 fund has been brought before a court in a contracting state to the 1992 fund convention but not to this protocol, any related action against the supplementary fund shall, at the option of the claimant, be brought either before a court of the state where the supplementary fund has its headquarters or before any court of a contracting state competent under paragraph 1 ARTICLE 81 subject to any decision concerning the distribution referred to in article 4, paragraph 3 of this protocol, any judgment given against the supplementary fund by a court having jurisdiction in accordance with article 7 of this protocol, shall, when it has become enforceable in the state of origin and is in that state no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, be recognized and enforceable in each contracting state on the same conditions as are prescribed in article x of the 1992 liability convention.2 a contracting state may apply other rules for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, provided that their effect is to ensure that judgments are recognised and enforced at least to the same extent as under paragraph 1 ARTICLE 91 the supplementary fund shall, in respect of any amount of compensation for pollution damage paid by the supplementary fund in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1, of this protocol, acquire by subrogation the rights that the person so compensated may enjoy under the 1992 liability convention against the owner or his guarantor.2 the supplementary fund shall acquire by subrogation the rights that the person compensated by it may enjoy under the 1992 fund convention against the 1992 fund.3 nothing in this protocol shall prejudice any right of recourse or subrogation of the supplementary fund against persons other than those referred to in the preceding paragraphs. in any event the right of the supplementary fund to subrogation against such person shall not be less favourable than that of an insurer of the person to whom compensation has been paid.4 without prejudice to any other rights of subrogation or recourse against the supplementary fund which may exist, a contracting state or agency thereof which has paid compensation for pollution damage in accordance with provisions of national law shall acquire by subrogation the rights which the person so compensated would have enjoyed under this protocol.contributions ARTICLE 101 annual contributions to the supplementary fund shall be made in respect of each contracting state by any person who, in the calendar year referred to in article 11, paragraph 2(a) or (b), has received in total quantities exceeding 150,000 tons:(a) in the ports or terminal installations in the territory of that state contributing oil carried by sea to such ports or terminal installations; and(b) in any installations situated in the territory of that contracting state contributing oil which has been carried by sea and discharged in a port or terminal installation of a non-contracting state, provided that contributing oil shall only be taken into account by virtue of this sub-paragraph on first receipt in a contracting state after its discharge in that non-contracting state.2 the provisions of article 10, paragraph 2, of the 1992 fund convention shall apply in respect of the obligation to pay contributions to the supplementary fund ARTICLE 111 with a view to assessing the amount of annual contributions due, if any, and taking account of the necessity to maintain sufficient liquid funds, the assembly shall for each calendar year make an estimate in the form of a budget of:(i) expenditure(a) costs and expenses of the administration of the supplementary fund in the relevant year and any deficit from operations in preceding years;(b) payments to be made by the supplementary fund in the relevant year for the satisfaction of claims against the supplementary fund due under article 4, including repayments on loans previously taken by the supplementary fund for the satisfaction of such claims;(ii) income(a) surplus funds from operations in preceding years, including any interest;(b) annual contributions, if required to balance the budget;(c) any other income.2 the assembly shall decide the total amount of contributions to be levied. on the basis of that decision, the director of the supplementary fund shall, in respect of each contracting state, calculate for each person referred to in article 10, the amount of that person's annual contribution:(a) in so far as the contribution is for the satisfaction of payments referred to in paragraph 1(i)(a) on the basis of a fixed sum for each ton of contributing oil received in the relevant state by such person during the preceding calendar year; and(b) in so far as the contribution is for the satisfaction of payments referred to in paragraph 1(i)(b) on the basis of a fixed sum for each ton of contributing oil received by such person during the calendar year preceding that in which the incident in question occurred, provided that state was a contracting state to this protocol at the date of the incident.3 the sums referred to in paragraph 2 shall be arrived at by dividing the relevant total amount of contributions required by the total amount of contributing oil received in all contracting states in the relevant year.4 the annual contribution shall be due on the date to be laid down in the internal regulations of the supplementary fund. the assembly may decide on a different date of payment.5 the assembly may decide, under conditions to be laid down in the financial regulations of the supplementary fund, to make transfers between funds received in accordance with paragraph 2(a) and funds received in accordance with paragraph 2(b) ARTICLE 121 the provisions of article 13 of the 1992 fund convention shall apply to contributions to the supplementary fund.2 a contracting state itself may assume the obligation to pay contributions to the supplementary fund in accordance with the procedure set out in article 14 of the 1992 fund convention ARTICLE 131 contracting states shall communicate to the director of the supplementary fund information on oil receipts in accordance with article 15 of the 1992 fund convention provided, however, that communications made to the director of the 1992 fund under article 15, paragraph 2, of the 1992 fund convention shall be deemed to have been made also under this protocol.2 where a contracting state does not fulfil its obligations to submit the communication referred to in paragraph 1 and this results in a financial loss for the supplementary fund, that contracting state shall be liable to compensate the supplementary fund for such loss. the assembly shall, on the recommendation of the director of the supplementary fund, decide whether such compensation shall be payable by that contracting state ARTICLE 141 notwithstanding article 10, for the purposes of this protocol there shall be deemed to be a minimum receipt of 1 million tons of contributing oil in each contracting state.2 when the aggregate quantity of contributing oil received in a contracting state is less than 1 million tons, the contracting state shall assume the obligations that would be incumbent under this protocol on any person who would be liable to contribute to the supplementary fund in respect of oil received within the territory of that state in so far as no liable person exists for the aggregated quantity of oil received ARTICLE 151 if in a contracting state there is no person meeting the conditions of article 10, that contracting state shall for the purposes of this protocol inform the director of the supplementary fund thereof.2 no compensation shall be paid by the supplementary fund for pollution damage in the territory, territorial sea or exclusive economic zone or area determined in accordance with article 3(a)(ii), of this protocol, of a contracting state in respect of a given incident or for preventive measures, wherever taken, to prevent or minimize such damage, until the obligations to communicate to the director of the supplementary fund according to article 13, paragraph 1 and paragraph 1 of this article have been complied with in respect of that contracting state for all years prior to the occurrence of that incident. the assembly shall determine in the internal regulations the circumstances under which a contracting state shall be considered as having failed to comply with its obligations.3 where compensation has been denied temporarily in accordance with paragraph 2, compensation shall be denied permanently in respect of that incident if the obligations to communicate to the director of the supplementary fund under article 13, paragraph 1 and paragraph 1 of this article, have not been complied with within one year after the director of the supplementary fund has notified the contracting state of its failure to report.4 any payments of contributions due to the supplementary fund shall be set off against compensation due to the debtor, or the debtor's agents.organization and administration ARTICLE 161 the supplementary fund shall have an assembly and a secretariat headed by a director.2 articles 17 to 20 and 28 to 33 of the 1992 fund convention shall apply to the

director of the 1992 fund, may also function as the secretariat and the director of the supplementary fund.2 if, in accordance with paragraph 1, the secretariat and the director of the 1992 fund also perform the function of secretariat and director of the supplementary fund, the supplementary fund shall be represented, in cases of conflict of interests between the 1992 fund and the supplementary fund, by the chairman of the assembly.3 the director of the supplementary fund, and the staff and experts appointed by the director of the supplementary fund, performing their duties under this protocol and the 1992 fund convention, shall not be regarded as contravening the provisions of article 30 of the 1992 fund convention as applied by article 16, paragraph 2, of this protocol in so far as they discharge their duties in accordance with this article.4 the assembly shall endeavour not to take decisions which are incompatible with decisions taken by the assembly of the 1992 fund. if differences of opinion with respect to common administrative issues arise, the assembly shall try to reach a consensus with the assembly of the 1992 fund, in a spirit of mutual co-operation and with the common aims of both organizations in mind.5 the supplementary fund shall reimburse the 1992 fund all costs and expenses arising from administrative services performed by the 1992 fund on behalf of the supplementary fund ARTICLE 18transitional provisions1 subject to paragraph 4, the aggregate amount of the annual contributions payable in respect of contributing oil received in a single contracting state during a calendar year shall not exceed 20% of the total amount of annual contributions pursuant to this protocol in respect of that calendar year.2 if the application of the provisions in article 11, paragraphs 2 and 3, would result in the aggregate amount of the contributions payable by contributors in a single contracting state in respect of a given calendar year exceeding 20% of the total annual contributions, the contributions payable by all contributors in that state shall be reduced pro rata so that their aggregate contributions equal 20% of the total annual contributions to the supplementary fund in respect of that year.3 if the contributions payable by persons in a given contracting state shall be reduced pursuant to paragraph 2, the contributions payable by persons in all other contracting states shall be increased pro rata so as to ensure that the total amount of contributions payable by all persons liable to contribute to the supplementary fund in respect of the calendar year in question will reach the total amount of contributions decided by the assembly.4 the provisions in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall operate until the total quantity of contributing oil received in all contracting states in a calendar year, including the quantities referred to in article 14, paragraph 1, has reached 1,000 million tons or until a period of
