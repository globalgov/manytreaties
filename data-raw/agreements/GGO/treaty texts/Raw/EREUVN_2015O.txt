notifies the other disputing Party that it does not intend to do so, and/or if the original

to rule on whether the benefits which a disputing Party intends to suspend are equivalent to
those affected by the measure found not to be in conformity with this Agreement, and
whether the proposed suspension is in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
The rulings of the Arbitral Panel shall be given within 45 days from the receipt of such
request and shall be final and binding to the disputing Parties. Benefits shall not be
suspended until the Arbitral Panel has issued its rulings.
4. Compensation and/or suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall not be preferred to
full elimination of the non-conformity as determined in the final report of the Arbitral Panel.
Compensation and/or suspension shall only be applied by a disputing Party until the measure
found not to be in conformity with this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to
bring it into conformity with this Agreement, or until the disputing Parties have resolved the
dispute otherwise.
5. Upon request of a disputing Party, the original Arbitral Panel shall rule on the conformity
with the final report of any implementing measure adopted after the suspension of benefits
and, in light of such rulings, whether the suspension of benefits should be terminated or
modified. The rulings of the Arbitral Panel shall be made within 30 days from the date of the
