\
Article 3 Bilateral cumulation of origin\
1. Materials originating in the Community shall be considered as materials originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6 (1) of this Protocol.\
2. Materials originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip shall be considered as materials originating in the Community when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6 (1) of this Protocol.\

The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\

(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);\

\
Article 7 Unit of qualification\
1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.\

\
Article 9 Sets\
Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.\
\
Article 10 Neutral elements\

\
\
\
ANNEX I\
\
INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II\
\
Note 1:\
The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of the Protocol.\
\
\
Note 2:\
2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex`, this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.\
2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.\
2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.\
2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.\
\
\
Note 3:\
3.1. The provisions of Article 5 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\
Example:\
An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from 'other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging` of heading No ex 7224.\
If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.\
3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.\
3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that 'materials of any heading` may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression 'manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No . . .` means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.\
3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.\
Example:\
The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.\
3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).\
Example:\
The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.\
However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.\
Example:\
In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.\
3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.\
\
\
Note 4:\
4.1. The term 'natural fibres` is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.\
4.2. The term 'natural fibres` includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.\
4.3. The terms 'textile pulp`, 'chemical materials` and 'paper-making materials` are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.\
4.4. The term 'man-made staple fibres` is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.\
\
\
Note 5:\
5.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).\
5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.\
The following are the basic textile materials:\
- silk,\
- wool,\
- coarse animal hair,\
- fine animal hair,\
- horsehair,\

- other products of heading No 5605.\
Example:\
A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.\
Example:\
A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.\
Example:\
Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.\
Example:\
If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.\
Example:\
A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the textile materials of the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.\
5.3. In the case of products incorporating 'yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped` this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.\
5.4. In the case of products incorporating 'strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film`, this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.\
\
\
Note 6:\
6.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials, with the exception of linings and interlinings, which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 per cent of the ex-works price of the product.\
6.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.\
Example:\
If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.\
6.3. Where a percentage rules applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.\
\
\
Note 7:\
7.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the 'specific processes` are the following:\
(a) vacuum distillation;\
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1);\
(c) cracking;\
(d) reforming;\
(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;\
(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\
(g) polymerization;\
(h) alkylation;\
(i) isomerization.\
7.2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the 'specific processes` are the following:\
(a) vacuum distillation;\
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (2);\
(c) cracking;\
(d) reforming;\
(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;\
(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;\
(g) polymerization;\
(h) alkylation;\
(ij) isomerization;\
(k) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurization with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);\
(l) in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;\
(m) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 \'b0C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\
(n) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distil, by volume, including losses, at 300 \'b0C by the ASTM D 86 method;\
(o) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.\
7.3. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.\

JOINT DECLARATIONS Joint Declaration on intellectual, industrial and commercial property (Article 33 of the Agreement)\
For the purpose of the Agreement, intellectual, industrial and commercial property includes in particular copyright, including the copyright in computer programmes, and neighbouring rights, patents, industrial designs, geographical indications, including appellations of origin, trademarks and service marks, topographies of integrated circuits, as well as protection against unfair competition as referred to in Article 10a of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Stockholm Act, 1967) and protection of undisclosed information on 'know-how`.\
\
\
\
Joint Declaration on Article 55 of the Agreement\
The Parties reaffirm their commitment to the Middle East Peace Process and their belief that peace should be consolidated through regional cooperation. The Community is prepared to support joint development projects submitted by the Palestinian Authority and other regional parties, subject to relevant Community technical and budgetary procedures.\
The Parties reaffirm that the Agreement forms part of the process launched at the Barcelona Conference of 27 November 1995 and that the bilateral cooperation between the European Community and the Palestinian Authority is complementary to the regional cooperation taking place in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.\
\
\
\
Joint Declaration on Article 58 of the Agreement\
The Parties agree that access to employment will not be included in the framework of youth exchange programmes.\
\
\
\
Joint Declaration on decentralized cooperation\
The Parties reaffirm the importance they attach to decentralized cooperation programmes as a means of encouraging exchanges of experience and transfer of knowledge in the Mediterranean region and between the European Community and its Mediterranean partners.\
\
\
\
Joint Declaration on Article 67 of the Agreement\
When the arbitration procedure is applied, the Parties will endeavour to ensure that the Joint Committee appoints a third arbitrator within two months of the appointment of the second arbitrator.\
\
\
\
Joint Declaration on Article 70 of the Agreement\
1. The Parties agree, for the purposes of the interpretation and the application of the Agreement, that the cases of special urgency referred to in Article 70 of the Agreement mean cases of substantial violation of the Agreement by one of the two Parties. A substantial violation of the Agreement consists of:\
- the rejection of the Agreement when such rejection is not authorized by the general rules of international law,\
- the violation of the essential elements of the Agreement set out in Article 2 thereof.\
2. The Parties agree that the appropriate measures referred to in Article 70 are measures taken in accordance with international law. If one Party takes a measure in a case of special urgency in application of Article 70 the other Party may invoke the dispute settlement procedure.\
\
\
\
Joint Declaration on data protection\
The Parties agree that the protection of data will be guaranteed in all areas where the exchange of personal data is envisaged.\
\
\
\
Joint Declaration on a programme of support for Palestinian industry\
The Parties agree that a programme of support will be put at the disposal of Palestinian industry, designed to nurture and develop the capacity of the Palestinian industrial sector.\
The Community extends access to start-up funding and to capital to Palestinian businesses in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This includes the European Community Investment Partners programme (ECIP), which provides assistance for business start-up costs, such as feasibility studies and technical assistance, and in some cases, access to funding for joint ventures. Loan funding, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, through a revolving fund administered by the Palestinian Development Fund, is also available on the basis of grants provided by the Community. The European Investment Bank extends loan funding and risk capital to Palestinian business through local banks.\
The Community has established the Centre for Private Development in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in order to provide support, training and advice to Palestinian industry, in business start-up and planning, business management, strategy and marketing.\
The Community recognizes that Palestinian industry must seek markets abroad. The present Agreement therefore permits duty-free access of Palestinian industrial products to European Community markets. The Palestinian Enterprise Centre, and, within it, the Euro-Info Centre, are therefore available to promote and facilitate contacts and joint ventures between European and Palestinian industry, through partnership events (the Euro-Partenariat, Med-Partenariat and Med-Enterprise schemes) and a variety of other means (such as the BC Net and BRE networks), which from time to time become available.\
The Community also recognizes that Palestinian industry has suffered from a lack of basic economic infrastructure. Noting that, in the context of the assistance provided by the Community for the development of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, part of this assistance may be provided in support of Palestinian industry, the Community will consider requests from the Palestinian Authority that a proportion of these funds, as grants or loans, may be devoted to the rehabilitation of vital economic infrastructures.\
In the framework of the economic cooperation provided for under the current Agreement, the two Parties will have regular exchanges of views in order to establish how the range of support mechanisms described in this Declaration, as well as any others which may become available, may most effectively be combined to provide the most appropriate support to Palestinian industry.\
Joint Declaration concerning the Principality of Andorra\
1. Products originating in the Principality of Andorra falling within Chapters 25 to 97 of the Harmonized System shall be accepted by the Palestinian Authority as originating in the Community within the meaning of this Agreement.\
2. Protocol 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purpose of defining the originating status of the abovementioned products.\
Joint Declaration concerning the Republic of San Marino\
1. Products originating in the Republic of San Marino shall be accepted by the Palestinian Authority as originating in the Community within the meaning of this Agreement.\
2. Protocol 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purpose of defining the originating status of the abovementioned products.}
