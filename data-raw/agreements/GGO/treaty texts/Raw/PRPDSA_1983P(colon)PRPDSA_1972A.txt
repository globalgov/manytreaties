period of validity of the form of approval shall not exceed two years.5) periodic surveys, at least every two years, shall be the responsibility of the contracting party which conducted the initial survey, or of a contracting party responsible for issuing a permit for current operations in consultation with that contracting party, to ensure that the incineration system continues to comply with these rules and continues to take account of the provisions of the code of practice. in the periodic survey, the operating data and maintenance records for the previous period shall be taken into account. if the incineration system still complies with these rules and takes account of the provisions of the code of practice, the contracting party shall renew the form of approval for a further period not exceeding two years.6) after any survey has been completed, no changes which affect the performance of the incineration system shall be made without the approval of the contracting party

of any changes affecting the performance of the incineration system, as mentioned in paragraph 6.8) a form of approval issued by a contracting party shall be recognised by other contracting parties unless there are clear grounds for believing that the incineration system is not in compliance with these rules. a copy of each form of approval and survey report shall be submitted to the commission.9) if the marine incineration facility is a vessel, contracting parties shall ascertain before issuing a form of approval that the vessel complies with the relevant provisions of the imco code for the construction and equipment of ships carrying dangerous chemicals in bulk.rule 4incineration permits and control over the nature of wastes for incineration1) an incineration permit maybe issued only for incineration operations to be performed on an approved marine incineration facility or for the purpose of an approval survey.2) any application for an incineration permit to a contracting party must contain the justification for the recourse to incineration as required by rule 2 paragraph 4 and all relevant information on the physical and chemical characteristics of the substances and materials proposed for incineration and especially information embodied in the code of practice.3) a contracting party which proposes to permit the incineration of substances and materials produced outside its jurisdiction shall obtain from the competent authorities confirmation of the origin of the substances and materials and their suitability for incineration.4) copies of incineration permits issued by contracting parties shall be available on the marine incineration facility and the commission shall be immediately notified, in accordance with the notification procedure referred to in rule 10.5) where a contracting party has doubts as to the thermal destructibility of the substances and materials proposed for incineration, pilot scale tests shall be undertaken before a permit may be issued.6) where a contracting party proposes to permit incineration of substances andmaterials which have been subject to pilot scale tests and over which doubts as to the efficiency of combustion remain, the incineration system shall be subject to the same intensive stack monitoring as required for the initial marine incineration system survey. consideration shall be given to the sampling and analysis of particulates, taking into account the solid content of the substances and materials.rule 5facilities for incineration at sea: operation requirements1) the operation of the incineration system shall be controlled so as to ensure that:a) the normal operating wall temperature exceeds 1200 °c unless the results of tests on the marine incineration facility demonstrate that the required combustion and destruction efficiencies can be achieved at a lower temperature. in the latter case, the commission shall be informed of the results of these tests;b) the theoretical minimum residence time within the incinerator, for a wall temperature of 1200 °c, is of the order of one second;c) the combustion efficiency based on: combustion efficiency((cco2-cco)/cco2) x100, where: [editor's change]cco2 = concentration of carbon dioxide in the combustion gasescco2 = concentration of carbon monoxide in the combustion gasesshall be at least 99.9 %;d) the destruction efficiency based on a determination of the amount of the organohalogen substances added to the furnace which is not destroyed shall be at least equal to the combustion efficiency of the incinerator, i.e. 99.9 %. the routine measurement of this parameter shall be mandatory only after adequate measuring devices become available and following a decision by the commission.2) there shall be no black smoke nor flame extension above the plane of the stack.rule 6data to be recorded1) marine incineration facilities shall utilise recording devices and methods as approved under rule 3. as a minimum, the following data shall be recorded during each incineration operation and retained for inspection by the contracting party which has issued the permit:a) wall temperature measurements;b) date and time during incineration and record of substances and materials being incinerated;c) vessel position by appropriate navigational means;d) feed rates and amounts of substances and materials;e) o2, co and co2 concentration in combustion gases;f) vessel's course and speed.2) where more than one contracting party has issued a permit for one incineration operation, arrangements for review of the data shall be made among the contracting parties involved.rule 7disposal of wastes and their residues1) the contracting party which proposes to issue an incineration permit shall ensure that there are no means of disposing of wastes from the marine incineration facility except by means of the incinerator during normal operations.2) tank washings and other residues contaminated by the waste shall be incinerated at sea in accordance with these rules and taking into account the provisions of the code of practice or discharged into port facilities in consultation with the competent national-authorities.3) any solid residues remaining in the incinerator shall not be removed from the incinerator until the marine incineration facility can safely offload them on land for disposal.rule 8prior consultation procedurea prior consultation procedure, to be determined by the commission, shall be followed:a) when a contracting party intends to issue a permit for the incineration ofsubstances and materials mentioned in paragraph 4 (c) of rule 2, except when these substances and materials have already been the subject of a prior consultation procedure;b) when a contracting party considers that the incineration at sea of certain substances and materials with a destruction or a combustion efficiency of less than 99.9% is acceptable because there is no alternative means of disposal;c) when a contracting party proposing to issue an incineration permit has doubts as to the technical conditions in which the operation could' take place and consequently considers it necessary to consult the other contracting parties to obtain additional information.rule 9incineration sites1) factors to be considered in establishing criteria governing the selection of incineration sites shall include, in addition to those listed in annex ill to the convention, the following:a) the prevailing atmospheric dispersal characteristics of the area including wind speed and direction, atmospheric stability, frequency of inversions and fog, precipitation types and amounts, relative humidity in order to determine the potential impact on the surrounding environment of pollutants released from the marine incineration facility, giving particular attention to the possibility of atmospheric transport of pollutants in fishing grounds and coastal areas;b) oceanic dispersal characteristics at the site in order to evaluate the potential impact of plume interaction with the sea;c) availability of navigational aids;d) the possible presence of undersea cables or pipelines if the vessel is to anchor in the incineration area.2) the contracting parties shall consult other interested contracting parties in the selection of an incineration site.3) the contracting parties shall promote the establishment of common incineration sites.4) the location of areas designate) for the incineration of wastes should be widely disseminated and communicated to the commission.5) the marine incineration facility shall reply promptly to radio calls at all times during the incineration.rule 10notificationthe contracting parties shall comply with notification procedures adopted by the commission.
