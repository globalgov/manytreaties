the accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials are not invoiced separately from the good; and

the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials are customary for the good.

If a good is subject to the RVC-based rule of origin, the value of the accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials shall be taken into account as the value of the originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the RVC of the originating good.

Article 4.14: Certificate of Origin

A claim that a good shall be accepted as eligible for preferential tariff treatment shall be supported by a Certificate of Origin (Form VC), as set out in Annex 4-C issued by the issuing authority and notified to the other Party in accordance with the Operational Certification Procedures, as set out in Annex 4-A.

The arbitral tribunal shall base its report on the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the submissions and arguments of the Parties, and may take into account any other relevant information provided to the arbitral tribunal.

The arbitral tribunal shall, within one hundred and eighty (180) days or within sixty (60) days in cases of urgency, including those which concern perishable goods, after the date of its establishment, submit to the Parties its draft report.

The draft report shall contain both the descriptive part summarizing the submissions and arguments of the Parties and the findings and determinations of the arbitral tribunal. If the Parties agree, the arbitral tribunal may make recommendations for resolution of the dispute in its report. The findings and determinations of the arbitral tribunal and, if applicable, any recommendations cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties provided in this Agreement.

When the arbitral tribunal considers that it cannot submit its draft report within the aforementioned one hundred and eighty (180) or sixty (60) day period referred to in paragraph 2, it shall inform the Parties in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will submit its report. Any delay shall not exceed a further period of thirty (30) days, unless the Parties otherwise agree.

A Party may provide written comments to the arbitral tribunal on its draft report within fifteen (15) days after the date of submission of the draft report.

After considering any written comments on the draft report, the arbitral tribunal may reconsider its draft report and make any further examination it considers appropriate.

The arbitral tribunal shall issue its report, within thirty (30) days after the date of submission of the draft report. The report shall include any separate opinions on matters not unanimously agreed and shall not disclose which arbitrators are associated with majority or minority opinions.

The report of the arbitral tribunal shall be available to the public within fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance, subject to the requirement to protect confidential information.

The report of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the Parties.
Article 12.11: Information and Technical Advice

Upon request of a Party or on its own initiative, unless the Parties disapprove, the arbitral tribunal may seek information and technical advice from any person or body that it deems appropriate. Any information and technical advice so obtained shall be made available to the Parties.

With respect to factual issues concerning other technical matter raised by a Party, the arbitral tribunal may request advisory reports in writing from an expert or experts. The arbitral tribunal, upon the request of a Party or on its own initiative, after a consultation with the Parties, may select scientific or technical experts who shall assist the arbitral tribunal throughout its proceedings but shall not have the right to vote in respect of any decision to be made by the arbitral tribunal.
Article 12.12: Implementation of the Report

Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the Party complained against shall immediately eliminate the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitral tribunal, or if this is not practicable, within a reasonable period of time.

The Parties shall continue to consult at all times on the possible development of a mutually satisfactory resolution.

The reasonable period of time referred to in paragraph 1 shall be mutually determined by the Parties. Where the Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time within forty five (45) days after the date of issuance of the report of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 12.10, either Party may refer the matter to an arbitral tribunal as provided for in Article 12.13(7), which shall determine the reasonable period of time.

Where there is disagreement between the Parties as to whether the Party complained against eliminated the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitral tribunal within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to paragraph 3, either Party may refer the matter to an arbitral tribunal as provided for in Article 12.13(7).
Article 12.13: Non-Implementation - Compensation and Suspension of Concessions or other Obligations

If the Party complained against notifies the complaining Party that it is impracticable, or the arbitral tribunal to which the matter is referred pursuant to Article 12.12(4) confirms that the Party complained against has failed to eliminate the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitral tribunal within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to Article 12.12(3), the Party complained against shall, if so requested, enter into negotiations with the complaining Party with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory compensation.

If there is no agreement on a mutually satisfactory compensation within twenty (20) days after the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1, the complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party complained against of concessions or other obligations under this Agreement, after giving notification of such suspension with thirty (30) days in advance. Such notification may only be given twenty (20) days after the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1.

The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 and the suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be temporary measures. Neither compensation nor suspension is preferred to full elimination of the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitral tribunal. The suspension shall only be applied until such time as the non-conformity is fully eliminated, or a mutually satisfactory resolution is reached.

In considering what concessions or other obligations to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2:

the complaining Party should first seek to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s) as that in which the report of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 12.10(7) has found a failure to comply with the obligations under this Agreement; and

if the complaining Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s), it may suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to other sectors. The notification of such suspension pursuant to paragraph 2 shall indicate the reasons on which it is based.

The level of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be equivalent to the level of the nullification or impairment.

If the Party complained against considers that the requirements for the suspension of concessions or other obligations by the complaining Party set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 or 5 have not been met, it may refer the matter to an arbitral tribunal.

The arbitral tribunal that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 12.12 shall have, wherever possible, as its arbitrators, the arbitrators of the original arbitral tribunal. If this is not possible, then the arbitrators to the arbitral tribunal that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 12.12 shall be appointed pursuant to Article 12.7. The arbitral tribunal established under this Article or Article 12.12 shall issue its report within sixty (60) days after the date when the matter is referred to it. When the arbitral tribunal considers that it cannot issue its report within the aforementioned sixty (60) day period, it may extend that period for a maximum of thirty (30) days with the consent of the Parties. The report shall be available to the public within fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance, subject to the requirement to protect confidential information. The report shall be final and binding on the Parties.
Article 12.14: Rules of Procedures

The Commission shall adopt the Rules of Procedures which provide for the details of the rules and procedures of arbitral tribunals established under this Chapter, at its first meeting. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitral tribunal shall follow the rules of procedure adopted by the Commission and may, after consulting the Parties, adopt additional rules of procedure consistent with the rules adopted by the Commission.

Article 12.15: Modification of Rules and Procedures

Any time period or other rules and procedures for arbitral tribunals, provided for in this Chapter, including the Rules of Procedures referred to in Article 12.14, may be modified by mutual consent of the Parties.
