with regulation 10 of annex v of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, 1973, as modified by the protocol of 1978 (marpol), a record is to be kept of each discharge operation or completed incineration. this includes discharges into the sea, to reception facilities, or to other ships, as well as the accidental loss of garbage.2 garbage and garbage managementgarbage means all kinds of food wastes, domestic wastes and operational wastes, all plastics, cargo residues, cooking oil, fishing gear, and animal carcasses generated during the normal operation of the ship and liable to be disposed of continuously or periodically except those substances which are defined or listed in other annexes to the present convention. garbage does not include fresh fish and parts thereof generated as a result of fishing activities undertaken during the voyage, or as a result of aquaculture activities which involve the transport of fish including shellfish for placement in the aquaculture facility and the transport of harvested fish including shellfish from such facilities to shore for processing.the guidelines for the implementation of annex v of

facilities, which includes barges and trucks, a receipt or certificate specifying the estimated amount of garbage transferred. the receipts or certificates must be kept together with the garbage record book.4.2 amount of garbagethe amount of garbage on board should be estimated in cubic metres, if possible separately according to category. the garbage record book contains many references to estimated amount of garbage. it is recognized that the accuracy of estimating amounts of garbage is left to interpretation. volume estimates will differ before and after processing. some processing procedures may not allow for a usable estimate of volume, e.g., the continuous processing of food waste. such factors should be taken into consideration when making and interpreting entries made in a record.record of garbage dischargesship's name: _______________________distinctive no., or letters: _______________________imo no.: ____________garbage categories:a. plasticsb. food wastesc. domestic
