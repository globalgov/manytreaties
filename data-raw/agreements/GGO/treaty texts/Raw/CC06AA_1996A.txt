agreement on the conservation of cetaceans of the black sea, mediterranean sea and contiguous atlantic areasource: the parties,recalling that the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals, 1979, encourages international co-operative action to conserve migratory species;recalling further that the third meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention, held in geneva in september 1991, urged range states to collaborate with a view to concluding, under the convention's auspices, a multilateral agreement for the conservation of small cetaceans of the mediterranean and black seas;recognizing that cetaceans are an integral part of the marine ecosystem which must be conserved for the benefit of present and future generations, and that their conservation is a common concern;recognizing the importance of integrating actions to conserve cetaceans with activities related to the socio-economic development of the parties concerned by this agreement, including maritime activities such as fishing and the free circulation of vessels in accordance with international law;aware that the conservation status of cetaceans can be adversely affected by factors such as degradation and disturbance of their habitats, pollution, reduction of food resources, use and abandonment of non-selective fishing gear, and by deliberate and incidental catches;convinced that the vulnerability of cetaceans to such threats warrants the implementation of specific conservation measures, where they do not already exist, by states or regional economic integration organizations that exercise sovereignty and/or jurisdiction over any part of their range, and by states, flag vessels of which are engaged outside national jurisdictional limits in activities that may affect the conservation of cetaceans;stressing the need to promote and facilitate co-operation among states, regional economic integration organizations, intergovernmental organizations and the non governmental sector for the conservation of cetaceans of the black sea, mediterranean sea, the waters which interconnect these seas, and the contiguous atlantic area;convinced that the conclusion of a multilateral agreement and its implementation through co-ordinated, concerted actions will contribute significantly to the conservation of cetaceans and their habitats in the most efficient manner, and will have ancillary benefits for other species;acknowledging that, despite past or ongoing scientific research, knowledge of the biology, ecology, and population dynamics of cetaceans is deficient, and that it is necessary to develop co-operation for research and monitoring of these species in order to fully implement conservation measures;acknowledging further that effective implementation of such an agreement will require that assistance be provided, in a spirit of solidarity, to some range states for research, training, and monitoring of cetaceans and their habitats, as well as for the establishment or improvement of scientific and administrative institutions;recognizing the importance of other global and regional instruments of relevance to the conservation of cetaceans, signed by many parties, such as the international convention for the regulation of whaling, 1946; the convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea against pollution, 1976, its related protocols and the action plan for the conservation of cetaceans in the mediterranean sea adopted under its auspices in 1991; the convention on the conservation of european wildlife and natural habitats, 1979; the united nations convention on the law of the sea, 1982; the convention on biological diversity, 1992; the convention for the protection of the black sea against pollution, 1992; and the global plan of action for the conservation, management and utilization of marine mammals of the united nations environment programme, adopted in 1984; as well as initiatives of inter alia the general fisheries council for mediterranean, the international commission for scientific exploration of the mediterranean, and the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE iscope, definitions and interpretation1. a) the geographic scope of this agreement, hereinafter referred

maximum extent of their economic, technical, and scientific capacities, the following measures for the conservation of cetaceans, giving priority to conserving those species or populations identified by the scientific committee as having the least favourable conservation status, and to undertaking research in areas or for species for which there is a paucity of data.1. adoption and enforcement of national legislationparties to this agreement shall adopt the necessary legislative, regulatory or administrative measures to give full protection to cetaceans in waters under their sovereignty and/or jurisdiction and outside these waters in respect of any vessel under their flag or registered within their territory engaged in activities which may affect the conservation of cetaceans. to this end, parties shall:a) develop and implement measures to minimize adverse effects of fisheries on the conservation status of cetaceans. in particular, no vessel shall be allowed to keep on board, or use for fishing, one or more drift nets whose individual or total length is more than 2.5 kilometres;b) introduce or amend regulations with a view to preventing fishing gear from being discarded or left adrift at sea, and to require the immediate release of cetaceans caught incidentally in fishing gear in conditions that assure their survival;c) require impact assessments to be carried out in order to provide a basis for either allowing or prohibiting the continuation or the future development of activities that may affect cetaceans or their habitat in the agreement area, including fisheries, offshore exploration and exploitation, nautical sports, tourism and cetacean-watching, as well as establishing the conditions under which such activities may be conducted;d) regulate the discharge at sea of, and adopt within the framework of other appropriate legal instruments stricter standards for, pollutants believed to have adverse effects on cetaceans; ande) endeavour to strengthen or create national institutions with a view to furthering implementation of the agreement.2. assessment and management of human-cetacean interactionsparties shall, in co-operation with relevant international organizations, collect and analyse data on direct and indirect interactions between humans and cetaceans in relation to inter alia fishing, industrial and touristic activities, and land-based and maritime pollution. when necessary, parties shall take appropriate remedial measures and shall develop guidelines and/or codes of conduct to regulate or manage such activities.3. habitat protectionparties shall endeavour to establish and manage specially protected areas for cetaceans corresponding to the areas which serve as habitats of cetaceans and/or which provide important food resources for them. such specially protected areas should be established within the framework of the convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea against pollution, 1976, and its relevant protocol, or within the framework of other appropriate instruments.4. research and monitoringparties shall undertake co-ordinated, concerted research on cetaceans and facilitate the development of new techniques to enhance their conservation. parties shall, in particular:a) monitor the status and trends of species covered by this agreement, especially those in poorly known areas, or species for which little data are available, in order to facilitate the elaboration of conservation measures;b) co-operate to determine the migration routes and the breeding and feeding areas of the species covered by the agreement in order to define areas where human activities may need to be regulated as a consequence;c) evaluate the feeding requirements of the species covered by the agreement and adapt fishing regulations and techniques accordingly;d) develop systematic research programmes on dead, stranded, wounded or sick animals to determine the main interactions with human activities and to identify present and potential threats; ande) facilitate the development of passive acoustic techniques to monitor cetacean populations.5. capacity building, collection and dissemination of information, training and educationtaking into account the differing needs and the developmental stages of the range states, parties shall give priority to capacity building in order to develop the necessary expertise for the implementation of the agreement. parties shall co-operate to develop common tools for the collection and dissemination of information about cetaceans and to organize training courses and education programmes. such actions shall be conducted in concert at the subregional and agreement level, supported by the agreement secretariat, the co-ordination units and the scientific committee and carried out in collaboration with competent international institutions or organizations. the results shall be made available to all parties. in particular, parties shall co-operate to:a) develop the systems for collecting data on observations, incidental catches, strandings, epizootics and other phenomena related to cetaceans;b) prepare lists of national authorities, research and rescue centres, scientists and non-governmental organizations concerned with cetaceans;c) prepare a directory of existing protected or managed areas which could benefit the conservation of cetaceans and of marine areas of potential importance for the conservation of cetaceans;d) prepare a directory of national and international legislation concerning cetaceans;e) establish, as appropriate, a subregional or regional data bank for the storage of information collected under paragraphs a) to d) above;f) prepare a subregional or regional information bulletin on cetacean conservation activities or contribute to an existing publication serving the same purpose;g) prepare information, awareness and identification guides for distribution to users of the sea;h) prepare, on the basis of regional knowledge, a synthesis of veterinary recommendations for the rescue of cetaceans; andi) develop and implement training programmes on conservation techniques, in particular, on observation, release, transport and first aid techniques, and responses to emergency situations.6. responses to emergency situationsparties shall, in co-operation with each other, and whenever possible and necessary, develop and implement emergency measures for cetaceans covered by this agreement when exceptionally unfavourable or endangering conditions occur. in particular, parties shall:a) prepare, in collaboration with competent bodies, emergency plans to be implemented in case of threats to cetaceans in the agreement area, such as major pollution events, important strandings
