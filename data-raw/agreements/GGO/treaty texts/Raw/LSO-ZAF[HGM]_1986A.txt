(12) The Present Value of the share of Lesotho of the investment element of the net benefit computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2), having made due allowance in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (11) for the revenue accruing to Lesotho by way of its share of the common revenue pool of the Customs Union, shall be equal to the aggregate of the Present Values of a uniform monthly amount when discounted at a discount rate of six per cent per annum from the Due Date applicable to each such monthly amount for a period of fifty years from January 1995, in accordance with the procedures set out in the Royalty Manual, which monthly amount shall constitute the fixed component of the royalty as provided for in paragraph (15): Provided that in the event of recomputation of the net benefit in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6) or (7) or (8) as the case may be, the recomputed monthly amount shall be that which when paid uniformly for the balance of the period of fifty years from January 1995 after the date on which the recomputed monthly amount becomes effective together with the monthly amount or amounts paid up to such date shall have in the aggregate a Present Value equal to that of the share of Lesotho of the investment element of the recomputed net benefit, having made due allowance in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (11) for the revenue accruing to Lesotho by way of its share of the common revenue pool of the Customs Union.
(13) The Present Value of the share of Lesotho of the operation element of the net benefit representing the difference in electricity costs attributable to pumping operations computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) shall be equal to the aggregate of the Present Values of the monthly amounts computed as the products of a constant unit rate in cents per cubic metre of water and the monthly average of the annual minimum quantity of water specified for each year in Annexure II, having made due allowance for shortfalls in such minimum quantities derived in the computation of the net benefit, when discounted at a discount rate of six percent per annum from the Due Date applicable to each such amount for a period of fifty years from January 1995 in accordance with the procedures set out in the Royalty Manual. Such unit rate shall form the basis for the computation of the variable component of the royalty in respect of the operation element representing the difference in electricity costs relating to pumping operations as provided for in paragraph (16): Provided that in the event of recomputation of the net benefit in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6) or (7) or (8) as the case may be, the monthly amounts derived as the products of a recomputed constant unit rate in cents per cubic metre of water and the monthly average of the annual minimum quantity of water specified in Annexure II for each year from the date such recomputed unit rate becomes effective, when paid monthly for the balance of the
period of fifty years from January 1995 after such date together with the monthly amounts paid up to such date, shall have in the aggregate a Present Value equal to the share of Lesotho of the operation element of the recomputed net benefit representing the difference in electricity costs attributable to pumping operations.
(14) The Present Value of the share of Lesotho of the operation and maintenance element of the net benefit representing the difference in the remaining operation and maintenance costs computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) shall be equal to the aggregate of the Present Values of the monthly amounts computed as the products of a constant unit rate in cents per cubic metre of water and the monthly average of the annual minimum quantity of water specified for each year in Annexure II, having made due allowance for shortfalls in such minimum quantities derived in the computation of the net benefit, when discounted at a discount rate of six percent per annum from the Due Date applicable to each such amount for a period of fifty years from January 1995 in accordance with the procedures set out in the Royalty Manual. Such unit rate shall form the basis for the computation of the variable component of the royalty in respect of the operation element representing the difference in the remaining operation and maintenance costs as provided for in paragraph (16): Provided that in the event of recomputation of the net benefit in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6) or (7) or (8) as the case may be, the monthly amounts derived as the products of a recomputed constant unit rate in cents per cubic metre of water and the monthly average of the annual minimum quantity of water specified in Annexure II for each year from the date such recomputed unit rate becomes effective, when paid monthly for the balance of the period of fifty years from January 1995 after such date together with the monthly amounts paid up to such date, shall have in the aggregate a Present Value equal to the share of Lesotho of the operation and maintenance element of the recomputed net benefit representing the difference in the remaining operation and maintenance costs.
(15) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (19) the monthly amount computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (12) shall accrue monthly as the fixed component of the royalty for a period of fifty years relative to the month of the first delivery of water to South Africa which shall be January 1995.
(16) Both variable components of the royalty shall accrue monthly for a period of fifty years relative to the month of the first delivery of water to South Africa which shall be January 1995, and such monthly amounts shall be determined as the products of the unit rates computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (13) and (14) and the quantity of water actually delivered to South Africa during each month not in excess of the Scheduled Monthly Demand and the quantity of water in excess of such Scheduled Monthly Demand utilized to recoup any shortfall in the Scheduled Monthly Demand for any previous month during such year or utilized during the first six months of any year to recoup any shortfall in the delivery of the minimum quantity specified for the previous year in Annexure II.
(17) South Africa shall be liable to pay to Lesotho royalties in respect of any quantity of water actually delivered to South Africa, in excess of the Scheduled Monthly Demand in any month during any one calendar year, which has not been utilized as provided for in paragraph (16) to recoup any previous shortfalls and which is utilized to recoup a shortfall in any subsequent month during the same calendar year. Such royalties shall be the product of the quantity of water utilized to effect such recoupment and a unit rate equal to the difference between the sum of the unit rates referred to in paragraphs (13) and (14) applicable at the time of such shortfall and the sum of the unit rates referred to in paragraph (1) of Article 13 applicable at the time such quantity of water is delivered.
(18) The unit rates computed in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (13) and (14) and applicable at the termination of the period of fifty years on 31 December 2044 shall continue to apply
subsequent to such period and subsequent to such date South Africa shall be liable to pay monthly to Lesotho amounts computed as:
