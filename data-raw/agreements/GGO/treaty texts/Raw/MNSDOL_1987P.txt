montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layersource: the parties to this protocol,being parties to the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer,mindful of their obligation under that convention to take appropriate measures to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting or likely to result from human activities which modify or are likely to modify the ozone layer,recognizing that world-wide emissions of certain substances can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer in a manner that is likely to result in adverse effects on human health and the environment,conscious of the potential climatic effects of emissions of these substances,aware that measures taken to protect the ozone layer from depletion should be based on relevant scientific knowledge, taking into account technical and economic considerations,determined to protect the ozone layer by taking precautionary measures to control equitably total global emissions of substances that deplete it, with the ultimate objective of their elimination on the basis of developments in scientific knowledge, taking into account technical and economic considerations,acknowledging that special provision is required to meet the needs of developing countries for these substances,noting the precautionary measures for controlling emissions of certain chlorofluorocarbons that have already been taken at national and regional levels,considering the importance of promoting international co-operation in the research and development of science and technology relating to the control and reduction of emissions of substances that deplete the ozone layer, bearing in mind in particular the needs of developing countries,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1: definitionsfor the purposes of this protocol:1. "convention" means the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer, adopted on 22 march 1985.2. "parties" means, unless the text otherwise indicates, parties to this protocol.3. "secretariat" means the secretariat of the convention.4. "controlled substance" means a substance listed in annex a to this protocol, whether existing alone or in a mixture. it excludes, however, any such substance or mixture which is in a manufactured product other than a container used for the transportation or storage of the substance listed.5. "production" means the amount of controlled substances produced minus the amount destroyed by technologies to be approved by the parties.6. "consumption" means production plus imports minus exports of controlled substances.7. "calculated levels" of production, imports, exports and consumption means levels determined in accordance with article 3.8. "industrial rationalization" means the transfer of all or a portion of the calculated level of production of one party to another, for the purpose of achieving economic efficiencies or responding to anticipated shortfalls in supply as a result of plant closures ARTICLE 2: control measures1. each party shall ensure that for the twelve-month period commencing on the first day of the seventh month following the date of the entry into force of this protocol, and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in group i of annex a does not exceed its calculated level of consumption in 1986. by the end of the same period, each party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such level may have increased by no more than ten per cent based on the 1986 level. such increase shall be permitted only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between parties.2. each party shall ensure that for the twelve-month period commencing on the first day of the thirty-seventh month following the date of the entry into force of this protocol, and in each twelve month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances listed in group ii of annex a does not exceed its calculated level of consumption in 1986. each party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such level may have increased by no more than ten per cent based on the 1986 level. such increase shall be permitted only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between parties. the mechanisms for implementing these measures shall be decided by the parties at their first meeting following the first scientific review.3. each party shall ensure that for the period 1 july 1993 to 30 june 1994 and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in group i of annex a does not exceed, annually, eighty per cent of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. each party producing one or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed, annually, eighty per cent of its calculated level of production in 1986. however, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to ten per cent of its calculated level of production in 1986.4. each party shall ensure that for the period 1 july 1998 to 30 june 1999, and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in group i of annex a does not exceed, annually, fifty per cent of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. each party producing one or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed, annually, fifty per cent of its calculated level of production in 1986. however, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to fifteen per cent of its calculated level of production in 1986. this paragraph will apply unless the parties decide otherwise at a meeting by a two-thirds majority of parties present and voting, representing at least two-thirds of the total calculated level of consumption of these substances of the parties. this decision shall be considered and made in the light of the assessments referred to in article 6.5. any party whose calculated level of production in 1986 of the controlled substances in group i of annex a was less than twenty-five kilotonnes may, for the purposes of industrial rationalization, transfer to or receive from any other party, production in excess of the limits set out in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 provided that the total combined calculated levels of production of the parties concerned does not exceed the production limits set out in this article. any transfer of such production shall be notified to the secretariat, no later than the time of the transfer.6. any party not operating under article 5, that has facilities for the production of controlled substances under construction, or contracted for, prior to 16 september 1987, and provided for in national legislation prior to 1 january 1987, may add the production from such facilities to its 1986 production of such substances for the purposes of determining its calculated level of production for 1986, provided that such facilities are completed by 31 december 1990 and that such production does not raise that party's annual calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances above 0.5 kilograms per capita.7. any transfer of production pursuant to paragraph 5 or any addition of production pursuant to paragraph 6 shall be notified to the secretariat, no later than the time of the transfer or addition.8. (a) any parties which are member states of a regional economic integration organization as defined in article 1(6) of the convention may agree that they shall jointly fulfil their obligations respecting consumption under this article provided that their total combined calculated level of consumption does not exceed the levels required by this article.(b) the parties to any such agreement shall inform the secretariat of the terms of the agreement before the date of the reduction in consumption with which the agreement is concerned.(c) such agreement will become operative only if all member states of the regional economic integration organization and the organization concerned are parties to the protocol and have notified the secretariat of their manner of implementation.9. (a) based on the assessments made pursuant to article 6, the parties may decide whether:(i) adjustments to the ozone depleting potentials specified in annex a should be made and, if so, what the adjustments should be; and(ii) further adjustments and reductions of production or consumption of the controlled substances from 1986 levels should be undertaken and, if so, what the scope, amount and timing of any such adjustments and reductions should be.(b) proposals for such adjustments shall be communicated to the parties by the secretariat at least six months before the meeting of the parties at which they are proposed for adoption.(c) in taking such decisions, the parties shall make every effort to reach agreement by consensus. if all efforts at consensus have been exhausted, and no agreement reached, such decisions shall, as a last resort, be adopted by a two-thirds majority vote of the parties present and voting representing at least fifty per cent of the total consumption of the controlled substances of the parties.(d) the decisions, which shall be binding on all parties, shall forthwith be communicated to the parties by the depositary. unless otherwise provided in the decisions, they shall enter into force on the expiry of six months from the date of the circulation of the communication by the depositary.10. (a) based on the assessments made pursuant to article 6 of this protocol and in accordance with the procedure set out in article 9 of the convention, the parties may decide:(i) whether any substances,
