convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakessource: preamblethe parties to this convention, mindful that the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes are important and urgent tasks, the effective accomplishment of which can only be ensured by enhanced cooperation,concerned over the existence and threats of adverse effects, in the short or long term, of changes in the conditions of transboundary watercourses and international lakes on the environment, economies and well-being of the member countries of the economic commission for europe (ece),emphasizing the need for strengthened national and international measures to prevent, control and reduce the release of hazardous substances into the aquatic environment and to abate eutrophication and acidification, as well as pollution of the marine environment, in particular coastal areas, from land-based sources,commending the efforts already undertaken by the ece governments to strengthen cooperation, on bilateral and multilateral levels, for the prevention, control and reduction of transboundary pollution, sustainable water management, conservation of water resources and environmental protection,recalling the pertinent provisions and principles of the declaration of the stockholm conference on the human environment, the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe (csce), the concluding documents of the madrid and vienna meetings of representatives of the participating states of the csce, and the regional strategy for environmental protection and rational use of natural resources in ece member countries covering the period up to the year 2000 and beyond,conscious of the role of the united nations economic commission for europe in promoting international cooperation for the prevention, control and reduction of transboundary water pollution and sustainable use of transboundary waters, and in this regard recalling the ece declaration of policy on prevention and control of water pollution, including transboundary pollution; the ece declaration of policy on the rational use of water; the ece principles regarding cooperation in the field of transboundary waters; the ece charter on groundwater management; and the code of conduct on accidental pollution of transboundary inland waters, referring to decisions i (42) and i (44) adopted by the economic commission for europe at its forty-second and forty-fourth sessions, respectively, and the outcome of the csce meeting on the protection of the environment (sofia, bulgaria, 16 october -3 november 1989),emphasizing that cooperation between member countries in regard to the protection and use of transboundary waters shall be implemented primarily through the elaboration of agreements between countries bordering the same waters, especially where no such agreements have yet been reached,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of this convention,1. "transboundary waters" means any surface or ground waters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between two or more states; wherever transboundary waters flow directly into the sea, these transboundary waters end at a straight line across their respective mouths between points on the low-water line of their banks;2. "transboundary impact" means any significant adverse effect on the environment resulting from a change in the conditions of transboundary waters caused by a human activity, the physical origin of which is situated wholly or in part within an area under the jurisdiction of a party, within an area under the jurisdiction of another party. such effects on the environment include effects on human health and safety, flora, fauna, soil, air, water, climate, landscape and historical monuments or other physical structures or the interaction among these factors; they also include effects on the cultural heritage or socio-economic conditions resulting from alterations to those factors;3. "party" means, unless the text otherwise indicates, a contracting party to this convention;4. "riparian parties" means the parties bordering the same transboundary waters;5. "joint body" means any bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation between the riparian parties;6. "hazardous substances" means substances which are toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic or bio-accumulative, especially when they are persistent;7. "best available technology" (the definition is contained in annex i to this convention).part iprovisions relating to all parties ARTICLE 2general provisions1. the parties shall take all appropriate measures to prevent, control and reduce any transboundary impact.2. the parties shall, in particular, take all appropriate measures:(a) to prevent, control and reduce pollution of waters causing or likely to cause transboundary impact;(b) to ensure that transboundary waters are used with the aim of ecologically sound and rational water management, conservation of water resources and environmental protection;(c) to ensure that transboundary waters are used in a reasonable and equitable way, taking into particular account their transboundary character, in the case of activities which cause or are likely to cause transboundary impact;(d) to ensure conservation and, where necessary, restoration of ecosystems.3. measures for the prevention, control and reduction of water pollution shall be taken, where possible, at source.4. these measures shall not directly or indirectly result in a transfer of pollution to other parts of the environment.5. in taking the measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, the parties shall be guided by the following principles:(a) the precautionary principle, by virtue of which action to avoid the potential transboundary impact of the release of hazardous substances shall not be postponed on the ground that scientific research has not fully proved a causal link between those substances, on the one hand, and the potential transboundary impact, on the other hand;(b) the polluter-pays principle, by virtue of which costs of pollution prevention, control and reduction measures shall be borne by the polluter;(c) water resources shall be managed so that the needs of the present generation are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.6. the riparian parties shall cooperate on the basis of equality and reciprocity, in particular through bilateral and multilateral agreements, in order to develop harmonized policies, programmes and strategies covering the relevant catchment areas, or parts thereof, aimed at the prevention, control and reduction of transboundary impact and aimed at the protection of the environment of transboundary waters or the environment influenced by such waters, including the marine environment.7. the application of this convention shall not lead to the deterioration of environmental conditions nor lead to increased transboundary impact.8. the provisions of this convention shall not affect the right of parties individually or jointly to adopt and implement more stringent measures than those set down in this convention ARTICLE 3prevention, control and reduction1. to prevent, control and reduce transboundary impact, the parties shall develop, adopt, implement and, as far as possible, render compatible relevant legal, administrative, economic, financial and technical measures, in order to ensure, inter alia, that:(a) the emission of pollutants is prevented, controlled and reduced at source through the application of, inter alia, low-and non-waste technology;(b) transboundary waters are protected against pollution from point sources through the prior licensing of waste-water discharges by the competent national authorities, and that the authorized discharges are monitored and controlled;(c) limits for waste-water discharges stated in permits are based on the best available technology for discharges of hazardous substances;(d) stricter requirements, even leading to prohibition in individual cases, are imposed when the quality of the receiving water or the ecosystem so requires;(e) at least biological treatment or equivalent processes are applied to municipal waste water, where necessary in a step-by-step approach;(f) appropriate measures are taken, such as the application of the best available technology, in order to reduce nutrient inputs from industrial and municipal sources;(g) appropriate measures and best environmental practices are developed and implemented for the reduction of inputs of nutrients and hazardous substances from diffuse sources, especially where the main sources are from agriculture (guidelines for developing best environmental practices are given in annex ii to this convention);(h) environmental impact assessment and other means of assessment are applied;(i) sustainable water-resources management, including the application of the ecosystems approach, is promoted;(j) contingency planning is developed;(k) additional specific measures are taken to prevent the pollution of groundwaters;(l) the risk of accidental pollution is minimized.2. to this end, each party shall set emission limits for discharges from point sources into surface waters based on the best available technology, which are specifically applicable to individual industrial sectors or industries from which hazardous substances derive. the appropriate measures mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article to prevent, control and reduce the input of hazardous substances from point and diffuse sources into waters, may, inter alia, include total or partial prohibition of the production or use of such substances. existing lists of such industrial sectors or industries and of such hazardous substances in international conventions or regulations, which are applicable in the area covered by this convention, shall be taken into account.3. in addition, each party shall define, where appropriate, water-quality objectives and adopt water-quality criteria for the purpose of preventing, controlling and reducing transboundary impact. general guidance for developing such objectives and criteria is given in annex iii to this convention. when necessary, the parties shall endeavour to update this annex. ARTICLE 4monitoringthe parties shall establish programmes for monitoring the conditions of transboundary waters ARTICLE 5research and developmentthe parties shall cooperate in the conduct of research into and development of effective techniques for the prevention, control and reduction of transboundary impact. to this effect, the parties shall, on a bilateral and/ or multilateral basis, taking into account research activities pursued in relevant international forums, endeavour to initiate or intensify specific research programmes, where necessary, aimed, inter alia, at:(a) methods for the

taken to mean the latest stage of development of processes, facilities or methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste. in determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of operation constitute the best available technology in general or individual cases, special consideration is given to:(a) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have recently been successfully tried out;(b) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(c) the economic feasibility of such technology;(d) time limits for installation in both new and existing plants;(e) the nature and volume of the discharges and effluents concerned;(f) low-and non-waste technology.2. it therefore follows that what is "best available technology" for a particular process will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as in the light of changes in scientific knowledge and understanding ANNEX iiguidelines for developing best environmental practices1. in selecting for individual cases the most appropriate combination of measures which may constitute the best environmental practice, the following graduated range of measures should be considered:(a) provision of information and education to the public and to users about the environmental consequences of the choice of particular activities and products, their use and ultimate disposal;(b) the development and application of codes of good environmental practice which cover all aspects of the product's life;(c) labels informing users of environmental risks related to a product, its use and ultimate disposal;(d) collection and disposal systems available to the public;(e) recycling, recovery and reuse;(f) application of economic instruments to activities, products or groups of products;(g) a system of licensing, which involves a range of restrictions or a ban.2. in determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practices, in general or in individual cases, particular consideration should be given to:(a) the environmental hazard of:(i) the product;(ii) the product's production;(iii) the product's use;(iv) the product's ultimate disposal;(b) substitution by less polluting processes or substances;(c) scale of use;(d) potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute materials or activities;(e) advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(f) time limits for implementation;(g) social and economic implications.3. it therefore follows that best environmental practices for a particular source will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as in the light of changes in scientific knowledge and understanding ANNEX iiiguidelines for developing water-quality objectives and criteriawater-quality objectives and criteria shall:(a) take into account the aim of maintaining and, where necessary, improving the existing water quality;(b) aim at the reduction of average pollution loads (in particular hazardous substances) to a certain degree within a certain period of time;(c) take into account specific water-quality requirements (raw water for drinking-water purposes, irrigation, etc.);(d) take into account specific requirements regarding sensitive and specially protected waters and their environment, e. g. lakes and groundwater resources;(e) be based on the application of ecological classification methods and chemical indices for the medium-and long-term review of water-quality maintenance and improvement;(f) take into account the degree to which objectives are reached and the additional protective measures, based on emission limits, which may be required in individual cases ANNEX ivarbitration1. in the event of a dispute being submitted for arbitration pursuant to article 22, paragraph 2 of this convention, a party or parties shall notify the secretariat of the subject-matter of arbitration and indicate, in particular, the articles of this convention whose interpretation or application is at issue. the secretariat shall forward the information received to all parties to this convention.2. the arbitral tribunal shall consist of three members. both the claimant party or parties and the other party or parties to the dispute shall appoint an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so appointed shall designate by common agreement the third arbitrator, who shall be the president of the arbitral tribunal. the latter shall not be a national of one of the parties to the dispute, nor have his or her usual place of residence in the territory of one of these parties, nor be employed by any of them, nor have dealt with the case in any other capacity.3. if the president of the arbitral tribunal has not been designated within two months of the appointment of the second arbitrator, the executive secretary of the economic commission for europe shall, at the request of either party to the dispute, designate the president within a further two-month period.4. if one of the parties to the dispute does not appoint an arbitrator within two months of the receipt of the request, the other party may so inform the executive secretary of the economic commission for europe, who shall designate the president of the arbitral tribunal within a further two-month period. upon designation, the president of the arbitral tribunal shall request the party which has not appointed an arbitrator to do so within two months. if it fails to do so within that period, the president shall so inform the executive secretary of the economic commission for europe, who shall make this appointment within a further two-month period.5. the arbitral tribunal shall render its decision in accordance with international law and the provisions of this convention.6. any arbitral tribunal constituted under the provisions set out in this annex shall draw up its own rules of procedure.7. the decisions of the arbitral tribunal, both on procedure and on substance, shall be taken by majority vote of its members.8. the tribunal may take all appropriate measures to establish the facts.9. the parties to the dispute shall facilitate the work of the arbitral tribunal and, in particular, using all means at their disposal, shall:(a) provide it with all relevant documents, facilities and information;(b) enable it, where necessary, to call witnesses or experts and receive their evidence.10. the parties and the arbitrators shall protect the confidentiality of any information they receive in confidence during the proceedings of the arbitral tribunal.11. the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of one of the parties, recommend interim measures of protection.12. if one of the parties to the dispute does not appear before the arbitral tribunal or fails to defend its case, the other party may request the tribunal to continue the proceedings and to render its final decision. absence of a party or failure of a party to defend its case shall not constitute a bar to the proceedings.13. the arbitral tribunal may hear and determine counter-claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute.14. unless the arbitral tribunal determines otherwise because of the particular circumstances of the case, the expenses of the tribunal, including the remuneration of its members, shall be borne by the parties to the dispute in equal shares. the tribunal shall keep a record of all its expenses, and shall furnish a final statement thereof to the parties.15. any party to this convention which has an interest of a legal nature in the subject-matter of the dispute, and which may be affected by a decision in the case, may intervene in the proceedings with the consent of the tribunal.16. the arbitral tribunal shall render its award within five months of the date on which it is established, unless it finds it necessary to extend the time limit for a period which should not exceed five months.17. the award of the arbitral tribunal shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons. it shall be final and binding upon all parties to the dispute. the award will be transmitted by the arbitral tribunal to the parties to the dispute and to the secretariat. the secretariat will forward the information received to all parties to this convention.18. any dispute which may arise between the parties concerning the interpretation or execution of the award may be submitted by either party to the arbitral tribunal which made the award or, if the latter cannot be seized thereof, to another tribunal constituted for this purpose in the same manner as the first.
