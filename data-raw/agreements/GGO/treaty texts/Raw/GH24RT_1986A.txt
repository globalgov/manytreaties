analysing the data, and the ways and means of evaluating actual levels of, and defining trends in, water purity ARTICLE 4the parties to the convention will, within two years from starting observations as per article 3 hereof, begin with determining water purity values for the areas involved to proceed at regular intervals to a collation, within the frame of bi- or trilateral agreements, with the neighbouring countries, i.e. with the parties to the convention. the collated values are considered to represent the actual purity of the tisza and its tributaries in the border areas ARTICLE 5the parties to the convention will, within the frame of their own national water protection programmes and according to their own technical and economical resources, take steps to combat pollution of the tisza and its tributaries in the border areas as seems appropriate from the actual water purity level ARTICLE 61) in case of any unforeseen event of importance, natural catastrophe or other calamity
