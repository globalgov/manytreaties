Agreement #2
Terms of reference for
1 Monitoring and Data Sharing
For sustainable development and proper management of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer Syste~ continllous
monitoring of the aquifer should be maintained. In order to observe the regional behavior of the NSAS,
monitored parameters of the aquifer should be shared between the concerned countries.
Hence, it is herewith agreed between the four countries sharing the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System.
namely Chad, Egypt, Libya and Sudan, represented by their National Coordinators to monitor and share
among them the following information:
Yearly extraction in every extraction site, specifying geographical location and number of
producing wells and springs in each site.
- Representative Electrical Conductivity measurements (EC), taken once a year in each
extraction site, followed by a complete chemical analysis if drastic changes in salinity is observed.
- Water level measurements taken twice a year in tho locations shown in the attached maps
and tables. The proposed monitoring network is subject to changes upon the feedback of the
National Coordinators of the concerned countries.
These measurements should be undertaken within the Nubian Aquifer System and the Post Nubian aquifer
System.
