DENMARK AND THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS,
RESPECTIVELY, CONCERNING THE DELIMITATION OF
THE CONTINENTAL SHELF UNDER THE NORTH SEA
I
(1) The Kingdom of Denmark, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the
Federal Republic of Germany have, on the basis of the Judgment of the
International Court of Justice of 20 February 1969,4 conducted trilateral
negotiations concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf under the North
Sea. In the course of these negotiations, the following two Treaties, signed this
day, were drawn up by agreement:
(a) Treaty between the Kingdom of Denmark and the Federal Republic of
Germany concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf under the
North Sea; 2
(b) Treaty between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of
Germany concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf under the North
Sea.3
These Treaties are, so far as the circumstances allow, identical.
(2) The Governments of the three signatory States, recognizing that the two
Treaties together determine the configuration and extent of the German part of
the continental shelf under the North Sea and consequently are closely
interrelated, intend to exchange the instruments of ratification of the two Treaties
at Bonn on the same date in order that they may enter into force simultaneously.
II
The Government of the Kingdom of Denmark and the Government of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands declare that the Agreement of 31 March 1966*
between the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark and the Government of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf
under the North Sea between the two countries shall cease to have effect as soon
as either of the Treaties signed this day, as referred to in section I above, enters
into force.
III
The German part of the continental shelf under the North Sea, whose
boundaries are established on the basis of the Judgment of the International
Court of Justice by the two Treaties referred to in section I above, is contiguous
to the United Kingdom part of the continental shelf.
(1) The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany consequently
intends to establish by treaty with the Government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland the common German-United Kingdom
boundary on the continental shelf, which runs from the termination point of the
German-Danish continental shelf boundary to the termination point of the
German-Netherlands continental shelf boundary.
(2) The Government of the Kingdom of Denmark intends to amend, by
agreement with the United Kingdom Government, 1 the Agreement of 3 March
1966 2 between the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark and the Government

delimitation of the continental shelf between the two countries in so far as
amendment thereof has become necessary as a result of the Treaty referred to in
section I, paragraph (1) (a).

by agreement with the United Kingdom Government,3 the Agreement of 6
October 1965 between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and
  the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
  relating to the delimitation of the continental shelf under the North Sea between
  the two countries in so far as amendment thereof has become necessary as a
