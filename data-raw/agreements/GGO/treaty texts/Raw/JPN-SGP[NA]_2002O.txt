measure set out in this paragraph is taken;
and
(ii) the most-favoured-nation applied rate of
customs duty in effect on the day
immediately preceding the date of entry into
force of this Agreement;
12
if an originating good of the other Party, which is
accorded the preferential tariff treatment provided for in
Article 14, as a result of the reduction or elimination of
a customs duty, is being imported into the territory of the
former Party in such increased quantities, in absolute
terms, and under such conditions that the imports of that
originating good alone constitute a substantial cause of
serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry
of the former Party.
2. A Party may take a measure set out in paragraph 1
above only after an investigation has been carried out by
the competent authorities of that Party in accordance with
the same procedures as those provided for in Article 3 and
paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the Agreement on Safeguards in
Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement (hereinafter referred to in

3. The following conditions and limitations shall apply
to the taking of a measure pursuant to paragraph 1 of this
Article:
(a) a Party shall immediately deliver a written
notice to the other Party upon:
(i) initiating an investigatory process relating
to serious injury, or threat thereof, and
the reasons for it;
(ii) making a finding of serious injury, or
threat thereof, caused by increased imports;
and
(iii) taking a decision to apply such a measure;
(b) in making the notification referred to in subparagraph (a) above, the Party proposing to apply
a measure shall provide the other Party with all
pertinent information, which shall include
evidence of serious injury or threat thereof
caused by the increased imports, a precise
description of the good involved and the proposed
measure, the proposed date of introduction of the
measure and its expected duration;
13
(c) a Party proposing to apply a measure shall
provide adequate opportunity for prior
consultations with the other Party with a view to
reviewing the information arising from the
investigation, exchanging views on the measure
and reaching an agreement on compensation set out
in paragraph 4 below. The Parties shall, in such
consultations, review, inter alia, the
information provided pursuant to sub-paragraph
(b) above, to determine:
(i) whether the provisions of this Article have
been complied with;
(ii) whether any proposed measure should be
taken; and
(iii) whether any proposed measure would operate
so as to constitute an unnecessary obstacle
to trade between the Parties;
(d) no measure shall be maintained except to the
extent and for such time as may be necessary to
prevent or remedy serious injury and to
facilitate adjustment provided that such time
shall not exceed a period of one year. In very
exceptional circumstances, after the prior
consultations referred to in sub-paragraph (c)
above, a measure may be maintained for up to a
total maximum period of three years. A Party
taking such measure shall present to the other
Party a schedule leading to its progressive
elimination;
(e) no measure shall be applied again to the import
of a particular originating good which has been
subject to the measure during the transition
period; and
(f) upon the termination of the measure, the rate of
customs duty shall be the rate which would have
been in effect but for the measure.
14
4. A Party proposing to apply a measure set out in
paragraph 1 of this Article shall provide to the other
Party mutually agreed adequate means of trade compensation
in the form of concessions of customs duties whose levels
are substantially equivalent to the value of the additional
duties expected to result from the measure. If the Parties
are unable to agree on the compensation within 30 days of
the commencement of the consultations pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph 3 above, the Party against whose
originating good the measure is taken shall be free to
suspend the application of concessions of customs duties
under this Agreement, which are substantially equivalent to
the measure applied under paragraph 1 of this Article. The
Party exercising the right of suspension may suspend the
application of concessions of customs duties only for the
minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially
equivalent effects.
5. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from
applying safeguard measures to a good being imported to
that Party irrespective of its source, including such a
good being imported from the other Party, unless such
measures are inconsistent with Article XIX of GATT 1994 and
the Agreement on Safeguards.
6. Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and
reasonable administration of its laws, regulations and
decisions governing proceedings of the measure.
7. Each Party shall, to the extent provided by its laws
and regulations, maintain judicial tribunals or procedures
for the purpose of the prompt review of administrative
actions relating to measures set out in paragraph 1 of this
Article. Such tribunals or procedures shall be independent
of the authorities responsible for the determination of the
measure in question.
8. Each Party shall adopt or maintain equitable, timely,
transparent and effective procedures relating to the
measure.
Article 19
General Exceptions under Chapter 2
1. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not
applied in a manner which would constitute a means of
arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other
Party, or a disguised restriction on trade in goods between
the Parties, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to
prevent the adoption or enforcement by either Party of
measures:
15
(a) necessary to protect public morals;

(f) imposed for the protection of national treasures
of artistic, historic or archaeological value;

natural resources if such measures are made
effective in conjunction with restrictions on
domestic production or consumption;
(h) undertaken in pursuance of obligations under any
inter-governmental commodity agreement which
conforms to criteria submitted to the members of
the WTO and not disapproved by them or which is
itself so submitted and not so disapproved;
(i) involving restrictions on exports of domestic
materials necessary to ensure essential
quantities of such materials to a domestic
processing industry during periods when the
domestic price of such materials is held below
the world price as part of a governmental
stabilisation plan; provided that such
restrictions shall not operate to increase the
exports of or the protection afforded to such
domestic industry, and shall not depart from the
provisions of GATT 1994 relating to nondiscrimination; and
16
(j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of
products in general or local short supply;
provided that any such measures shall be
consistent with the principle that all members of
the WTO are entitled to an equitable share of the
international supply of such products, and that
any such measures, which are inconsistent with
the other provisions of this Agreement shall be
discontinued as soon as the conditions giving
rise to them have ceased to exist.
2. In the application of paragraph 1 above, the relevant
interpretations and operation of the WTO Agreement shall,
where appropriate, be taken into account.
Article 20
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments
under Chapter 2

a Party from taking any measure for balance-of-payments
purposes. A Party taking such measure shall do so in
accordance with the conditions established under Article
XII of GATT 1994 and the Understanding on the Balance-ofPayments Provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade 1994 in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement.
Article 21
Miscellaneous Provisions under Chapter 2
1. In fulfilling its obligations under this Chapter, each
Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be
available to it to ensure the observance of the provisions
of this Chapter by local governments within its territory.
2. If a Party has entered into an international agreement
on trade in goods with a non-Party, or enters into such an
agreement after this Agreement comes into force, it shall
favourably consider according to goods originating in or
destined for the territory of the other Party, treatment no
less favourable than the treatment which it accords to like
goods originating in or destined for the territory of that
non-Party pursuant to such an agreement.

satisfy the product-specific rules provided for in Annex II
A shall be considered as goods to which sufficient
transformation has been carried out in a Party.
19
3. Product-specific rules requiring that the materials
used undergo a change in tariff classification or a
specific manufacturing or processing operation shall apply
only to non-originating materials.
4. (a) Product-specific rules using the value-added
method require that:

determined in accordance with sub-paragraph
(b) below and Article 24 below, is not less
than the percentage specified by the rule
for the good in Annex II A; and

or operation which satisfies the requirement
of sub-paragraph (i) above in the territory
of either Party.
(b) For the purpose of calculating the qualifying

applied:
F.O.B. – N.Q.M.
Q.V.C. = x 100
F.O.B.
Where:

payable by the buyer to the seller,
regardless of the mode of shipment, not
including any internal excise taxes reduced,
exempted, or repaid when the good is
exported; and
N.Q.M. is the non-qualifying value of
materials used by the producer in the
production of the good, calculated in
accordance with sub-paragraph (c) below.
(c) For the purpose of calculating the non-qualifying
value of materials pursuant to sub-paragraph (b)
above, the following formula shall be applied:
N.Q.M. = T.V.M. - Q.V.M.
20
Where:
T.V.M. is the total value of materials; and
Q.V.M. is the qualifying value of materials.
5. For the purpose of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 4
above:
(a) the qualifying value of materials shall be:

material satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (b) below; or
(ii) the value of the material that can be
attributed to one or both of the Parties if
the material does not satisfy the
requirements of sub-paragraph (b) below; and
(b) for the purpose of sub-paragraph (a) above, a
material shall be considered to have satisfied
the requirements of this sub-paragraph if:
(i) the content of the value of the material
that can be attributed to one or both of the
Parties is not less than 60 per cent of the
total value of the material; and
(ii) the material has undergone its last
production or operation in the territory of
either Party.
6. The value of a material used in the production of a
good in a Party shall be the CIF value and shall be
determined in accordance with the Agreement on Customs
Valuation, or, if this is not known and cannot be
ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the
material in the Party.
7. A material used in the production of a good, for which
no product-specific rule is provided for in Annex II A:
(a) shall not be deemed a non-originating material if
the material satisfies the same product-specific
rule, specified for the good in Annex II A,
requiring a change in tariff classification or a
specific manufacturing or processing operation;
or
21
(b) shall be deemed a qualifying material if the
material satisfies the same product-specific rule,
specified for the good in Annex II A, using the
value-added method.
Article 24
Accumulation
1. For the purpose of determining whether a good is an
originating good of the other Party, either Party shall
consider the production in its territory as that in the
territory of the other Party, where such good is produced
in the territory or territories of one or both Parties.
2. The production of a Party includes the production at
different stages undertaken by one or more producers
located in its territory.
Article 25
De Minimis
For the application of the product-specific rules
provided for in Annex II A, non-originating materials which
do not satisfy the rules shall be disregarded, provided
that the totality of such materials does not exceed
specific percentages in value, weight or volume of the good,
as provided for in each chapter of Annex II A.

Article 58 above, each Party shall accord services and
service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less
favourable than that provided for under the terms,

Note: If a Party undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to
the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to
in (i) of sub-paragraph (o) of paragraph 6 of Article 58 above
and if the cross-border movement of capital is an essential part
of the service itself, that Party is thereby committed to allow
such movement of capital. If a Party undertakes a market-access

of legal entity or joint venture through which a

commitments in Annex IV C, and subject to any conditions
and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord
to services and service suppliers of the other Party, in
respect of all measures affecting the supply of services,
treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its
own like services and service suppliers.(Note)
Note: Specific commitments assumed under Article 60 shall not be
construed to require either Party to compensate for any inherent
competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign
character of the relevant services or service suppliers.
2. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 above
by according to services and service suppliers of the other
Party, either formally identical treatment or formally
different treatment to that it accords to its own like
services and service suppliers.

shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies
the conditions of competition in favour of services or
service suppliers of a Party compared to like services or
service suppliers of the other Party.

under Chapter 21 with respect to a measure of the other

Such commitments shall be inscribed in a Party’s Schedule
of specific commitments in Annex IV C.
Article 62
Service Suppliers of Any Non-Party
Each Party shall also accord treatment granted under
this Chapter to a service supplier other than those of the
Parties, that is a juridical person constituted under the
laws of either Party, and who supplies a service through
commercial presence, provided that it engages in
substantive business operations in the territory of either
Party.
Article 63

and
(d) where appropriate, the time-frame for

this Agreement as Annex IV C.
47
4. (a) If a Party has entered into an international
agreement on trade in services with a non-Party,
or enters into such an agreement after this

consider according to services and service
suppliers of the other Party, treatment no less
favourable than the treatment that it accords to
like services and service suppliers of that nonParty pursuant to such an agreement.

agreement on the avoidance of double taxation or
provisions on the avoidance of double taxation in

each Party shall ensure that all measures of general
application affecting trade in services are administered in
a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.
2. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as
practicable judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals
or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected
service supplier of the other Party, for the prompt review
of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for,
administrative decisions affecting trade in services.
Where such procedures are not independent of the agency
entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the
Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for
an objective and impartial review.
3. The provisions of paragraph 2 above shall not be
construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or
procedures where this would be inconsistent with its
constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system.
4. Where authorisation is required for the supply of a
service on which a specific commitment has been made, the
competent authorities of a Party shall, within a reasonable
period of time after the submission of an application
considered complete under that Party’s domestic laws and
regulations, inform the applicant of the decision
concerning the application. At the request of the
applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall
provide, without undue delay, information concerning the
status of the application.
48
5. In sectors where a Party has undertaken specific
commitments subject to any terms, limitations, conditions
or qualifications set out therein, the Party shall not
apply licensing and qualification requirements and
technical standards that nullify or impair such specific
commitments in a manner which:
(a) does not comply with the following criteria:
(i) based on objective and transparent criteria,
such as competence and the ability to supply
the service;
(ii) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure
the quality of the service; or
(iii) in the case of licensing procedures, not in
themselves a restriction on the supply of
the service; and
(b) could not reasonably have been expected of that
Party at the time the specific commitments in
those sectors were made.
6. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with
its obligations under paragraph 5 above, account shall be
taken of international standards of relevant international
organisations(Note) applicable to that Party.
Note: The term “relevant international organisations” refers to
international bodies whose membership is open to the relevant
bodies of both Parties.
Article 65
Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of
a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the
monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner
inconsistent with the Party’s specific commitments.
2. Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either
directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of
a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and
which is subject to that Party’s specific commitments, the
Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its
monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner
inconsistent with such commitments.
49
3. If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly
supplier of a service of the other Party is acting in a
manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2 above, it may
request the other Party to provide specific information
concerning the relevant operations.
4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to
cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party,
formally or in effect:
(a) authorises or establishes a small number of
service suppliers; and
(b) substantially prevents competition among those
suppliers in its territory.
Article 66
Business Practices
1. The Parties recognise that certain business practices
of service suppliers, other than those falling under
Article 65 above, may restrain competition and thereby
restrict trade in services.
2. A Party shall, at the request of the other Party,
enter into consultations with a view to eliminating
practices referred to in paragraph 1 above. The Party
addressed shall accord full and sympathetic consideration
to such a request and shall co-operate through the supply
of publicly available non-confidential information of
relevance to the matter in question. The Party addressed
shall also provide other information available to the
requesting Party, subject to its domestic law and to the
conclusion of a satisfactory agreement concerning the
safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting Party.

obligations of the Parties as members of the International
Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to in this Chapter as
“the Fund”) under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund,
including the use of exchange actions which are in
conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the Fund,
provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any
capital transactions inconsistently with its specific
commitments regarding such transactions, except under
Article 68 below, or at the request of the Fund.
Article 68
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments
under Chapter 7
1. In the event of serious balance-of-payments and
external financial difficulties or threat thereof, a Party
may adopt or maintain restrictions on trade in services on
which it has undertaken specific commitments, including on
payments or transfers for transactions related to such
commitments.
2. The restrictions referred to in paragraph 1 above:

Agreement of the Fund;

economic and financial interests of the other
Party;
(e) shall not exceed those necessary to deal with the
circumstances described in paragraph 1 above; and
(f) shall be temporary and be phased out
progressively as the situation specified in
paragraph 1 above improves.
3. In determining the incidence of such restrictions, a
Party may give priority to the supply of services which are
more essential to their economic or development programmes.
However, such restrictions shall not be adopted or
maintained for the purpose of protecting a particular
service sector.
51
4. Any restrictions adopted or maintained under paragraph
1 of this Article, or any changes therein, shall be
promptly notified to the other Party.
5. Where a Party has adopted restrictions pursuant to
paragraph 1 of this Article:
(a) that Party shall commence consultations with the
other Party promptly in order to review the
restrictions adopted by the former Party;
(b) the restrictions shall be subjected to annual
review through further consultations, beginning
one year after the date that the consultations
referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above commenced.
At these consultations, all restrictions applied
for balance-of-payments purposes shall be
reviewed. The Parties may also agree to a
different frequency of such consultations;
(c) such consultations shall assess the balance-ofpayments situation of the Party concerned and the
restrictions adopted or maintained under this
Article, taking into account, inter alia, such
factors as:
(i) the nature and extent of the balance-ofpayments and the external financial
difficulties;
(ii) the external economic and trading
environment of the consulting Party; and
(iii) alternative corrective measures which may be
available;
(d) the consultations shall address the compliance of
the restrictions with paragraph 2 of this Article,
in particular the progressive phaseout of
restrictions in accordance with sub-paragraph (f)
of paragraph 2 of this Article; and
(e) in such consultations, all findings of
statistical and other facts presented by the Fund
relating to foreign exchange, monetary reserves
and balance-of-payments, shall be accepted and
conclusions shall be based on the assessment by
the Fund of the balance-of-payments and the
external financial situation of the consulting
Party.
52
Article 69
General Exceptions under Chapter 7
1. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not
applied in a manner which would constitute a means of
arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other
Party, or a disguised restriction on trade in services
between the Parties, nothing in this Chapter shall be
construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by either
Party of measures:
(a) necessary to protect public morals or to maintain
public order;(Note)
Note: The public order exception may be invoked only where
a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed
to one of the fundamental interests of society.

in relation to the processing and
dissemination of personal data and the

equitable or effective(Note) imposition or
collection of direct taxes in respect of services
or service suppliers of the other Party.
Note: Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or
effective imposition or collection of direct taxes
include measures taken by a Party under its taxation
system which:
(i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in
recognition of the fact that the tax obligation
of non-residents is determined with respect to
taxable items sourced or located in the Party’s
territory;
53
(ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the
imposition or collection of taxes in the
Party’s territory;
(iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to
prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes,
including compliance measures;

from the territory of the other Party in order
to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes
on such consumers derived from sources in the
Party’s territory;

worldwide taxable items from other service
suppliers, in recognition of the difference in
the nature of the tax base between them; or

gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident
persons or branches, or between related persons
or branches of the same person, in order to
safeguard the Party’s tax base.

paragraph 1 of Article 69 and in this note are
determined according to tax definitions and concepts,
or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts,
under the domestic law of the Party taking the
measure.
2. In the application of paragraph 1 above, the relevant
interpretations and operation of the WTO Agreement shall,
where appropriate, be taken into account.

vessel in whole or in part but which is of a
non-Party;

person, if it establishes that the service
supplier is neither a “service supplier of the

other than those of the Parties” granted benefits
under Article 62.

value of the expropriated investments. The fair market
value shall not reflect any change in market value
occurring because the expropriation had become publicly

dispute is a dispute between a Party and an investor of the
other Party that has incurred loss or damage by reason of,
or arising out of, an alleged breach of any right conferred
by this Chapter with respect to the investments of the

settlement procedures, that investor may either:
(a) request the establishment of an arbitral tribunal
in accordance with the procedures set out in
Annex V C and submit the investment dispute to
that tribunal;

arbitration in accordance with the provisions of
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment

developing a mutually acceptable resolution, through
compensation or any alternative arrangement, and agreeing
on a reasonable period to implement such resolution.
3. If the other Party considers that the measures taken
by the implementing Party to comply with the original award
do not comply with the original award, it may request
consultations.

implementation of the original award to an arbitral
tribunal if:

implementing Party has failed to comply with the original
award within the implementation period as determined

above, the other Party may, within 30 days from the date of
such confirmation by the arbitral tribunal, notify the
implementing Party that it intends to suspend the
application to the implementing Party of the obligations of
the other Party under this Agreement or the Implementing
Agreement.

compensation or other alternative arrangement within the
implementation period as determined pursuant to paragraph 2

expiration of such implementation period, notify the
implementing Party that it intends to suspend the
application to the implementing Party of the obligations of
the other Party under this Agreement or the Implementing
Agreement.
7. Suspension pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 6 above may
only be implemented at least 30 days after the date of the
notification in accordance with that paragraph. Such
suspension:

dispute to which the suspension relates,
consultations, or proceedings before an arbitral
tribunal are in progress;
(b) shall be temporary, and shall be discontinued
when the Parties reach a mutually satisfactory
resolution or where compliance with the original
award is effected;
(c) shall be restricted to the level of nullification
or impairment that is attributable to the failure
to comply with the original award; and
(d) shall be restricted to the same sector or sectors
to which the nullification or impairment relates,
unless it is not practicable or effective to
suspend obligations in such sector or sectors.
98
8. If the implementing Party considers that the
requirements in paragraph 5, 6 or 7 above have not been met,
it may request consultations with the other Party. The
other Party shall enter into consultations within 10 days

this is not possible, then the members to the arbitral
tribunal shall be appointed pursuant to paragraphs 3 to 7
