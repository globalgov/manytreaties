protocol on the prevention of pollution of the mediterranean sea by transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposalsource: https://iea.uoregon.edu/marinemammals/engine/documents/2-0889-0906.htmlthe contracting parties to the present protocol,being parties to the convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea against pollution, adopted at barcelona on 16 february 1976 and amended on 10 june 1995,conscious of the danger threatening the environment of the mediterranean sea caused by the transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous wastes,convinced that the most effective way of protecting human health and the marine environment from the dangers posed by hazardous wastes is the reduction and elimination of their generation, for example through substitution and other clean production methods,recognizing the increased will for the prohibition of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal in other states, especially in developing countries,taking into account the 1992 rio declaration on environment and development and especially principle 14 which declares that states "should effectively cooperate to discourage or prevent the relocation and transfer to other states of any activities or substances that cause severe environmental degradation or are found to be harmful to human health",aware of the growing international concern regarding the need to ensure that pollution originating in one state is not transferred to other states and, consistent with this objective, of the need to reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum as far as possible, with the ultimate aim of phasing out such movements,recognizing also that any state has the sovereign right to ban the entry, transit or disposal of hazardous wastes in its territory,bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the united nations convention on the law of the sea of 1982,taking into account also the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, adopted on 22 march 1989, in particular article 11, and decisions i/ 22, ii/ 12 and iii/ adopted by the first, second and third meetings respectively of the conference of the parties to the basel convention,taking into account further that many states, among them contracting parties to the barcelona convention, have taken legal measures and entered into international agreements consistent with the basel convention to ban transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, for example, the ivth acp/ eec convention signed in lome on 15 december 1989 by the european economic community and the african, caribbean and pacific group of states, and the bamako convention on the ban of the import into africa and the control of transboundary movement and management of hazardous wastes within africa, adopted under the auspices of the organization of african unity on 30 january 1991,recognizing further the differences in levels of economic and legislative development among the various mediterranean coastal states, and realizing that hazardous waste should not be allowed to be transported in order to take advantage of such economic or legislative disparities to the detriment of the environment and of the social well-being of developing countries,bearing in mind also the fact that the most effective way of dealing with the threats represented by wastes for human health and the environment consists in decreasing or even prohibiting the transfer of activities which generate hazardous wastes,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of this protocol:(a) "convention" means the convention for the protection of the mediterranean

6transboundary movement and notification proceduresin exceptional cases, unless otherwise prohibited, when hazardous wastes cannot be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner in the country in which they originated, transboundary movements of such wastes can be allowed if:1. the special situation of the mediterranean developing countries which do not have the technical capabilities nor the disposal facilities for the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes is taken into consideration.2. the competent authority of the state of import ensures that the hazardous waste is disposed of in an approved site or facility with the technical capacity for its environmentally sound disposal.3. the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes only takes place with the prior written notification of the state of export as specified in annex iv to this protocol, and the prior written consent of the state( s) of import and the state( s) of transit. this paragraph does not apply to conditions of passage through the territorial sea, which are governed by paragraph 4 of this article.4. the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes through the territorial sea of a state of transit only takes place with the prior notification by the state of export to the state of transit, as specified in annex iv to this protocol. after reception of the notification, the state of transit brings to the attention of the state of export all the obligations relating to passage through its territorial sea in application of international law and the relevant provisions of its domestic legislation adopted in compliance with international law to protect the marine environment. where necessary, the state of transit may take appropriate measures in accordance with international law. this procedure must be complied with within the delays provided for by the basel convention.5. every state involved in a transboundary movement ensures that such movement is consistent with international safety standards and financial guarantees, in particular the procedures and standards set out in the basel convention ARTICLE 7duty to reimportthe state of export shall reimport the hazardous wastes if the transboundary movement cannot be completed by reason of impossibility of performance of the contracts relating to the movement and disposal of the wastes. to this end, any state of transit shall not oppose, hinder or prevent the return of those wastes to the state of export after being properly informed by the state of export ARTICLE 8regional cooperation1. in conformity with article 13 of the convention, the parties shall cooperate as far as possible in scientific and technological fields related to pollution from hazardous wastes, particularly in the implementation and development of new methods for reducing and eliminating hazardous waste generated through clean production methods.2. to this end, the parties shall submit annual reports to the organization regarding the hazardous wastes they generate and transfer within the protocol area in order to enable the organization to produce a hazardous waste audit.3. the parties shall cooperate in taking appropriate measures to implement the precautionary approach based on prevention of pollution problems arising from hazardous wastes and their transboundary movement and disposal. to this end, the parties shall ensure that clean production methods are applied to production processes ARTICLE 9illegal traffic1. for the purpose of this protocol, any transboundary movement of hazardous wastes in contravention of this protocol or of other rules of international law shall be deemed to be illegal traffic.2. each party shall introduce appropriate national legislation to prevent and punish illegal traffic, including criminal penalties on all persons involved in such illegal activities.3. in the case of illegal traffic due to the conduct of the generator or the exporter, the state of export shall ensure that the wastes in question are taken back by the exporter or the generator or, if necessary, by itself, into the state of export within 30 days from the time the illegal traffic has come to its attention and that appropriate legal action is taken against the contravenor( s).4. in the case of illegal traffic due to the conduct of the importer or disposer, the state of import shall ensure that the wastes in question are eliminated according to environmentally sound methods by the importer within 30 days from the time the illegal traffic has come to the attention of the state of import; if not possible, the state of export shall ensure that the wastes are taken back by the exporter, the generator or, if necessary, by itself into the state of export. the competent authorities of the importing or exporting states shall ensure that legal proceedings according to this protocol are taken against the contravenor( s).5. in cases where the responsibility for the illegal traffic cannot be assigned either to the exporter or generator or to the importer or disposer, the parties concerned or other parties, as appropriate, shall ensure, through cooperation that the wastes in question are disposed of as soon as possible in an environmentally sound manner either in the state of export or the state of import or elsewhere as appropriate.6. the parties shall forward, as soon as possible, all information relating to illegal traffic to the organization, which shall distribute the information to all contracting parties.7. the parties shall cooperate to ensure that no illegal traffic takes place. upon request, the organization shall assist parties in their identification of cases of illegal traffic and shall circulate immediately to the parties concerned any information it has received regarding illegal traffic.8. the organization shall undertake the necessary coordination with the secretariat of the basel convention in relation to the effective prevention and monitoring of illegal traffic in hazardous wastes. such coordination shall be mainly based on:(a) exchange of information on cases or alleged cases of illegal traffic in the mediterranean and coordination of action to remedy such cases;(b) providing assistance in the field of capacity-building, including development of national legislation and of appropriate infrastructure in the mediterranean states with a view to the prevention and penalization of illegal traffic in hazardous wastes;(c) the establishment of a mechanism to prevent and monitor illegal traffic in hazardous wastes in the mediterranean ARTICLE

including sewage and sewage sludgesy47 residues arising from the incineration of household wastes ANNEX iilist of hazardous characteristicsun class * code characteristics1 h1 explosive: an explosive substance or waste is a solid or liquid substance or waste (or mixture of substances or wastes) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.3 h3 flammable liquids: the word "flammable" has the same meaning as "inflammable". flammable liquids are liquids, or mixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (for example paints, varnishes, lacquers, etc., but not including substances or wastes otherwise classified on account of their dangerous characteristics) which give off a flammable vapour at temperatures of not more than 60.5 degrees c, closed-cup test, or not more than 65.6 degrees c, open-cup test. (since the results of open-cup tests and of closed-cup tests are not strictly comparable and even individual results by the same test are often variable, regulations varying from the above figures to make allowance for such difference would be within the spirit of this definition.)4.1 h4.1 flammable solids: solids, or waste solids, other than those classed as explosives, which under conditions encountered in transport are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.4.2 h4.2 substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion: substances or wastes which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions encountered in transport, or in heating up on contact with air, and being liable to catch fire.4.3 h4.3 substances or wastes which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases: substances or wastes which, by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities.5.1 h5.1 oxidizing: substances or wastes which, while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may generally by yielding oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of other materials.5.2 h5.2 organic peroxides: organic substances or wastes which contain the bivalent-o-o-structure are thermally unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition.6.1 h6.1 poisonous (acute): substances or wastes liable either to cause death or serious injury or to harm human health if swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact.6.2 h6.2 infectious substances: substances or wastes containing viable microorganisms or their toxins which are known or suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.8 h8 corrosives: substances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact with living tissue, or in the case of leakage, will materially damage, or even destroy, other goods or the means of transport; they may also cause other hazards.9 h10 liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water: substances or wastes which, by interaction with air or water, are liable to give off toxic gases in dangerous quantities.9 h11 toxic (delayed or chronic): substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity.9 h12 ecotoxic: substances or wastes which if released present or may present immediate or delayed adverse impacts on the environment by means of bioaccumulation and/ or toxic effects upon biotic systems.9 h13 capable, by any means, after disposal, of yielding another material, e. g. leachate, which possesses any of the characteristics listed above.* corresponds to the hazardous classification system included in the united nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods (st/ sg/ ac. 10/ 1/ rev. 5, united nations, new york, 1988) ANNEX iiidisposal operationsthe list of disposal operations contained in this annex
