preferential tariff rate means the rate of customs duty for an imported good pursuant to Annex 3.4;

provisional measure means a provisional safeguard measure described in Article 8.8;

safeguard measure means a transitional safeguard measure described in Article 8.5;

serious injury means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry;

threat of serious injury means serious injury that, on the basis of facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility, is clearly imminent; and

transition period means the five (5) year period beginning on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, except in the case of a product where the liberalization process occurs over a longer period of time, the transition period shall be equal to the period in which such a product reaches zero tariff according to the Tariff Schedule as specified in Annex 3.4.

Article 8.5: Application of a Transitional Safeguard Measure

If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty pursuant to this Agreement, an originating good of a Party is being imported into the other Party’s territory in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the other Party may, to the minimum extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and facilitate adjustment, apply a safeguard measure, consisting of:
the suspension of the further reduction of any rate of customs duty provided for under this Agreement on the good from the date on which the action to apply the safeguard measure is taken; or

an increase of the rate of customs duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of:

the most-favoured-nation (MFN) applied rate of customs duty in effect on the date on which the action to apply the safeguard measure is taken; or

the MFN applied rate of customs duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement.
Article 8.6: Scope and Duration of Transitional Safeguard Measures

A Party shall apply a safeguard measure only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. A Party may apply a safeguard measure for an initial period of no longer than two (2) years. The period of a safeguard measure may be extended by up to one (1) year provided that the conditions of this Chapter are met and that the safeguard measure continues to be applied to the minimum extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting. The total period of a safeguard measure, including any extensions thereof, shall not exceed three (3) years. Regardless of its duration or whether it has been subject to extension, a safeguard measure on a good shall terminate at the end of the transition period for such good. No new safeguard measure may be applied to a good after that date.

In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the proposed duration of a safeguard measure is over one (1) year, the Party applying the measure shall progressively liberalise it at regular intervals during the application of the measure, including at the time of any extension.

No safeguard measure shall be applied again to the import of a particular originating good which has been subject to such a safeguard measure, for a period of time equal to the duration of the previous safeguard measure or one (1) year, whichever is longer.

A Party shall not apply a safeguard or provisional measure on a good that is subject to a measure that the Party has applied pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.

On the termination of a safeguard measure, the Party that applied the measure shall apply the rate of customs duty set out in its Tariff Schedule as specified in Annex 3.4 (Elimination of Customs Duties) on the date of termination as if the safeguard measure had never been applied.
Article 8.7: Investigation

A Party shall apply or extend a safeguard measure only following an investigation by the Party’s competent authorities to examine the effect of increased imports of an originating good of the other Party on the domestic industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as production, productivity, levels of sales, utilisation of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and investment, none of which is necessarily decisive. When factors other than increased imports of an originating good of the other Party resulting from the reduction or elimination of a customs duty pursuant to this Agreement are simultaneously causing injury to the domestic industry, such injury shall not be attributed to such increased imports.

An investigation under paragraph 1 shall only take place in accordance with Article 3 and 4.2 (c) of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards; and to this end Article 3 and 4.2 (c) are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.
Article 8.8: Provisional Measures

In highly unusual and critical circumstances where delay would cause injury which would be difficult to repair, a Party may apply a provisional safeguard measure pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports of an originating good of the other Party as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty pursuant to this Agreement have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury. The duration of such a provisional measure shall not exceed one hundred and fifty (150) days, during which period the pertinent requirements of Articles 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7 shall be met. The duration of any such provisional measure shall be counted as part of the total period referred to in Article 8.6.1. Any additional customs duties collected as a result of such a provisional measure shall be promptly refunded if the subsequent investigation referred to in Article 8.7 does not determine that increased imports of an originating good of the other Party have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. In such a case, the Party that applied the measure shall apply the rate of customs duty set out in its Tariff Schedule as specified in Annex 3.4 as if the provisional measure had never applied.

In determining whether such highly unusual and critical circumstances exist, a Party shall have regard to the rate of increase of imports of an originating good of the other Party, both in absolute and relative terms, and the overall level of the Party’s imports of the good from the other Party as a share of total imports of the good, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty on the good pursuant to this Agreement.
Article 8.9: Notification and Consultation

A Party shall promptly notify the other Party, in writing, on:

initiating an investigation under Article 8.7;

making a finding of serious injury or threat thereof caused by increased imports of an originating good of the other Party as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty on the good pursuant to this Agreement;

taking a decision to apply or extend a safeguard measure, or to apply a provisional measure; and

taking a decision to progressively liberalise a safeguard measure previously applied.

A Party shall provide to the other Party a copy of the public version of the report of its competent authorities required under Article 8.7 immediately as it is available.

In making a notification pursuant to paragraph 1, the Party applying or extending a safeguard measure shall also provide evidence of serious injury or threat thereof caused by increased imports of an originating good of the other Party as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty pursuant to this Agreement, a precise description of the good involved, the details of the proposed measure including as appropriate the grounds for not selecting the measure described in Article 8.5 (a), the date of introduction, duration, and timetable for progressive liberalisation of the measure, if such timetable is applicable. In the case of an extension of a measure, evidence that the domestic industry concerned is adjusting shall also be provided. Upon request, the Party applying or extending a safeguard measure shall provide additional information as the other Party may consider necessary.

A Party proposing to apply or extend a safeguard measure shall provide adequate opportunity for prior consultations with the other Party, with a view to, inter alia, reviewing the information provided under paragraph 3, exchanging views on the measure and reaching an agreement on compensation as set forth in Article 8.10.

Where a Party applies a provisional measure referred to in Article 8.8, on request of the other Party, consultations shall be initiated immediately after such application.

The provisions on notification in this Chapter shall not require a Party to disclose confidential information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular juridical persons, public or private.

The Parties shall provide an English translation of notifications under this Article and any other communications between parties.
Article 8.10: Compensation

A Party applying a safeguard measure shall, in consultation with the other Party, provide to the other Party mutually agreed trade liberalising compensation in the form of substantially equivalent concessions. Such consultations shall begin within thirty (30) days of the application of the safeguard measure.

If the Parties are unable to reach agreement on compensation within thirty (30) days after the consultations commence, the exporting Party shall be free to suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the trade of the Party applying the safeguard measure.

The right of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first year that a safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the safeguard measure has been taken as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that such a measure conforms to the provisions of this Chapter.

A Party shall notify the other Party in writing at least thirty (30) days before suspending concessions under paragraph 2.

The obligation to provide compensation under paragraph 1 and the right to suspend substantially equivalent concessions under paragraph 2 shall terminate on the date of the termination of the safeguard measure.

Each Party shall maintain or institute, as soon as practicable, judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service supplier, for the prompt review of and, where justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services. Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.

With a view to ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards, and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, including that such measures are, inter alia:

The Parties agree to coordinate on such negotiations as appropriate.
Article 9.9: Recognition

Where a Party recognises, autonomously or by agreement or arrangement, the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of a non-Party, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require the Party to accord such recognition to the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of the other Party.

A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing, or certification of services suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.
Article 9.10: Emergency Safeguard Measures

The Parties take note of the multilateral negotiations pursuant to Article X of GATS on the question of emergency safeguard measures.

At the request of a Party, or on its own initiative, the arbitral panel may seek information and technical advice from any person or body that it deems appropriate, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Parties may set. The arbitral panel shall provide the Parties with a copy of any advice or opinion obtained and an opportunity to provide comments.

The arbitral panel shall, in consultation with the Parties, regulate its own procedures governing the rights of Parties to be heard and its own deliberations where such procedures are not otherwise set out in this Chapter and in Annex 14.10.

Any time period or other rules and procedures for arbitral panels provided for in this Chapter, including Annex 14.10, may be modified by mutual consent of the Parties. The Parties may also agree at any time not to apply any provision of this Chapter.
Article 14.11: Suspension or Termination of Proceedings

Where the Parties agree, an arbitral panel may suspend its work at any time for a period not exceeding twelve (12) months. In the event of such a suspension, all relevant time-frames set out in this Chapter and in Annex 14.10 shall be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. If the work of the arbitral panel has been suspended for more than twelve (12) months, the arbitral panel’s authority for considering the dispute shall lapse unless the Parties agree otherwise.

The Parties may agree at any time to terminate the proceedings of the arbitral panel established under this Chapter by jointly notifying the chair of that arbitral panel.
Article 14.12: Report

The report of the arbitral panel shall be drafted without the presence of the Parties. The arbitral panel shall base its report on the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the submissions and arguments of the Parties, and may take into account any other relevant information provided to the arbitral panel.

The arbitral panel shall, within one hundred and twenty (120) days, or within sixty (60) days in cases of urgency, including those which concern perishable goods, after the date of its establishment, submit to the Parties its draft report.

The draft report shall contain both the descriptive part summarising the submissions and arguments of the Parties, and the findings and determinations of the arbitral panel. If the Parties agree, the arbitral panel may make recommendations for resolution of the dispute in its report. The findings and determinations of the arbitral panel and, if applicable, any recommendations cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties provided in this Agreement.

When the arbitral panel considers that it cannot submit its draft report within the aforementioned one hundred and twenty (120) or sixty (60) day period, it may extend that period with the consent of the Parties.

A Party may provide written comments to the arbitral panel on its draft report within fifteen (15) days after the date of submission of the draft report.

After considering any written comments on the draft report, the arbitral panel may reconsider its draft report and make any further examination it considers appropriate.

The arbitral panel shall issue its final report, within thirty (30) days after the date of submission of the draft report. The report shall include any separate opinions on matters not unanimously agreed, not disclosing which panelists are associated with majority or minority opinions.

The final report of the arbitral panel shall be available to the public within fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance, subject to the requirement to protect confidential information.
Article 14.13: Implementation of the Report

Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the Party complained against shall eliminate the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitral panel immediately, or if this is not practicable, within a reasonable period of time.

The Parties shall continue to consult at all times on the possible development of a mutually satisfactory resolution.

The reasonable period of time referred to in paragraph 1 shall be mutually determined by the Parties. Where the Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time within forty five (45) days after the date of issuance of the report of the arbitral panel referred to in Article 14.12, either Party may refer the matter to an arbitral panel as provided for in Article 14.14.7, which shall determine the reasonable period of time.

Where there is disagreement between the Parties as to whether the Party complained against eliminated the non-conformity, as determined in the report of the arbitral panel, within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to paragraph 3, either Party may refer the matter to an arbitral panel as provided for in Article 14.14.7.
Article 14.14: Non-Implementation – Compensation and Suspension of Concessions or other Obligations

If the Party complained against notifies the complaining Party that it is impracticable, or the arbitral panel to which the matter is referred pursuant to Article 14.13.4 confirms that the Party complained against has failed to eliminate the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitral panel within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to Article 14.13.3, the Party complained against shall, if so requested, enter into negotiations with the complaining Party with a view to reaching mutually satisfactory compensation.

If there is no agreement on satisfactory compensation within twenty (20) days after the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1, the complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party complained against of concessions or other obligations under this Agreement, after giving notification of such suspension thirty (30) days in advance. Such notification may only be given twenty (20) days after the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1.

The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 and the suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be temporary measures. Neither compensation nor suspension is preferred to full elimination of the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitral panel. The suspension shall only be applied until such time as the non-conformity is fully eliminated or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.

In considering what concessions or other obligations to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2:

the complaining Party should first seek to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s) as that in which the report of the arbitral panel referred to in Article 14.12 has found a failure to comply with the obligations under this Agreement; and

if the complaining Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s), it may suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to other sectors. The notification of such suspension pursuant to paragraph 2 shall indicate the reasons on which it is based.

The level of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be equivalent to the level of the nullification or impairment.

If the Party complained against considers that the requirements for the suspension of concessions or other obligations by the complaining Party set out in paragraph 2, 3, 4 or 5 have not been met, it may refer the matter to an arbitral panel.

The arbitral panel that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 14.13 shall have, wherever possible, as its panelists, the panelists of the original arbitral panel. If this is not possible, then the panelists to the arbitral panel that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 14.13 shall be appointed pursuant to Article 14.7. The arbitral panel established under this Article or Article 14.13 shall issue its report within sixty (60) days after the date when the matter is referred to it. When the arbitral panel considers that it cannot issue its report within the aforementioned sixty (60) day period, it may extend that period for a maximum of thirty (30) days with the consent of the Parties. The report shall be available to the public within fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance, subject to the requirement to protect confidential information. The report shall be final and binding on the Parties.
