contracting parties have a duty to cooperate for the purposes of achieving compatible measures in respect of such stocks of fisheries resources as occur in the convention area and in areas under the jurisdiction of any contracting party. the appropriate contracting party and the commission shall accordingly promote the compatibility of such measures. this compatibility shall be ensured in such a way which does not undermine measures established in accordance with articles 61 and 119 of the 1982 convention.2. for the purpose of paragraph 1, the coastal states and the commission shall develop and agree on standards for reporting and exchanging data on fisheries for the stocks concerned as well as statistical data on the status of the stocks.3. each contracting party shall keep the

dependent mainly on fishing for the stocks in the south-east atlantic; and(h) the needs of coastal states whose economies are overwhelmingly dependent on the exploitation of fishery resources.2. in applying the provisions of paragraph 1, the commission may, inter alia :(a) designate annual quota allocations or effort limitations for contracting parties;(b) allocate catch quantities for exploration and scientific research; and(c) set aside fishing opportunities for non-parties to this convention, if necessary.3. the commission shall, subject to agreed rules, review quota allocations, effort limitations and participation in fishing opportunities of contracting parties taking into account the information, advice and recommendations on the implementation of, and compliance with, conservation and management measures by contracting parties ARTICLE 21 recognition of the special requirements of developing states in the region1. the contracting parties shall give full recognition to the special requirements of developing states in the region in relation to conservation and management of fishery resources and the development of such resources.2. in giving effect to the duty to cooperate in the establishment of conservation and management measures for stocks covered by this convention, the contracting parties shall take into account the special requirements of such developing states, in particular:(a) the vulnerability of developing states in regions which are dependent on the exploitation of living marine resources, including for meeting the nutritional requirements of their populations or parts thereof;(b) the need to avoid adverse impacts on, and ensure access to fisheries by, subsistence, small-scale and artisanal fishers and women fishworkers; and(c) the need to ensure that such measures do not result in transferring, directly or indirectly, a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto developing states in the region.3. the contracting parties shall cooperate through the commission and other subregional or regional organisations involved in the management of fishery resources:(a) to enhance the ability of developing states in the region to conserve and manage fishery resources and to develop their own fisheries for such resources; and(b) to assist developing states in the region which may fish for fishery resources, to enable them to participate in fisheries for such resources, including facilitating access in accordance with this convention.4. cooperation with developing states in the region for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance, assistance relating to human resources development, technical assistance, transfer of technology, and activities directed specifically towards:(a) improved conservation and management of the fishery resources covered by this convention through collection, reporting, verification, exchange and analysis of fisheries data and related information;(b) stock assessment and scientific research; and(c) monitoring, control, surveillance, compliance and enforcement, including training and capacity-building at the local level, development and funding of national and regional observer programmes and access to technology and equipment ARTICLE 22 non-parties to this convention1. the contracting parties shall, either directly or through the commission, request non-parties to this convention whose vessels fish in the convention area to cooperate fully with the organisation either by becoming party to the convention or by agreeing to apply the conservation and management measures adopted by the commission with a view to ensuring that such measures are applied to all fishing activities in the convention area. such non-parties to this convention shall enjoy benefits from participation in the fishery commensurate with their commitment to comply with conservation and management measures in respect of the relevant stocks.2. contracting parties may exchange information between each other or through the commission on, and shall inform the commission of activities of, fishing vessels flying the flags

following the notification specified in subparagraph (a), notifies the commission that it is unable to accept a measure, that measure shall not, to the extent stated, be binding upon that contracting party; however, the measure shall remain binding on all other contracting parties unless the commission decides otherwise;(d) any contracting party which makes a notification under subparagraph (c) shall at the same time provide a written explanation of its reasons for making the notification and, where appropriate, its proposals for alternative measures which the contracting party is going to implement. the explanation shall specify inter alia whether the basis for the notification is that:(i) the contracting party considers that the measure is inconsistent with the provisions of this convention;(ii) the contracting party cannot practicably comply with the measure;(iii) the measure unjustifiably discriminates in form or in fact against the contracting party; or(iv) other special

request an ad hoc expert panel established in accordance with article 24 to make recommendations on any interim measures following the invocation of the procedures pursuant to subparagraphs (c) and (d) which may be necessary in respect of the measure to be reviewed. subject to paragraph 3, such interim measures shall be binding on all contracting parties if all contracting parties (other than those who have indicated that they are unable to accept the measure, pursuant to subparagraphs (c) and (d)) agree that the long term sustainability of the stocks covered by this convention will be undermined in the absence of such measures.2. any contracting party which invokes the procedure set out in paragraph 1 may at any time withdraw its notification of non-acceptance and become bound by the measure immediately if it is already in effect or at such time as it may come into effect under this article.3. this article is without prejudice to the right of any contracting party to invoke

expeditiously without recourse to binding procedures for the settlement of disputes.4. where a dispute is not referred for settlement within a reasonable time of the consultations referred to in paragraph 2, or where a dispute is not resolved by recourse to other means referred to in this article within a reasonable time, such dispute shall, at the request of any party to the dispute, be
