waste or scrap derived from production there, provided that such goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials; or

waste or scrap derived from used goods collected there, provided that those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials; and

a good produced there, exclusively from goods referred to in subparagraphs (a) through (j), or from their derivatives.
Article 3.4: Regional Value Content

Each Party shall provide that a regional value content requirement specified in this Chapter, including Annex 3-B, to determine whether a good is originating, is calculated as follows:

build-down method: based on the value of non-originating materials:

 	Value of the Good – VNM	 
RVC =	---------------------------------	x 100
 	Value of the Good	 

build-up method: based on the value of originating materials:

 	VOM	 
RVC =	---------------------------------	x 100
 	Value of the Good	 

where:

RVC is the regional value content of a good, expressed as a percentage;

VNM is the value of non-originating materials, including materials of undetermined origin, used in the production of the good;

VOM is the value of originating materials used in the production of the good in the territory of one or both Parties.

Each Party shall provide that all costs considered for the calculation of regional value content are recorded and maintained in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the territory of the Party where the good is produced.
Article 3.5: Materials Used in Production

Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material undergoes further production such that it satisfies the requirements of this Chapter, the material is treated as originating when determining the originating status of the subsequently produced good, regardless of whether that material was produced by the producer of the good.

Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material is used in the production of a good, the following may be counted as originating content for the purpose of determining whether the good meets a regional value content requirement:

the value of processing of the non-originating materials undertaken in the territory of one or both Parties; and

the value of any originating material used in the production of the non-originating material undertaken in the territory of one or both Parties.
Article 3.6: Value of Materials Used in Production

Each Party shall provide that for the purposes of this Chapter, the value of a material is:
for a material imported by the producer of the good, the transaction value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the material;

for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced:

the price paid or payable by the producer in the Party where the producer is located;

the value as determined for an imported material in subparagraph (a); or

the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the Party; or

for a material that is self-produced:

all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes general expenses; and

an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that is being valued.
Article 3.7: Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials

Each Party shall provide that for an originating material, the following expenses may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 3.6:

the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred to transport the material within the territories of the Parties to the location of the producer of the good;

duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in the territory of one or both Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and

the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.

Each Party shall provide that, for a non-originating material or material of undetermined origin, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of the material:

the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the material within the territories of the Parties to the location of the producer of the good;

duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or both Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and

the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.

If the cost or expense listed in paragraph 1 or 2 is unknown or documentary evidence of the amount of the adjustment is not available, then no adjustment is allowed for that particular cost.
Article 3.8: Accumulation

Originating goods or materials of a Party, incorporated into a good in the territory of the other Party, shall be considered to be originating in the territory of the other Party.

A good shall be considered originating where the good is produced in the territory of one or both Parties by one or more producers, provided that the good satisfies the requirements established in Article 3.2 and all other applicable requirements in this Chapter.
Article 3.9: De Minimis

Each Party shall provide that a good that contains non-originating materials that do not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification requirement specified in Annex 3-B for the good is nonetheless an originating good if:

the value of all these materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the good, as defined under Article 3.1, or

the good is classified in Chapters 50 through 63 of the Harmonized System, the total weight of all such materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the total weight of the good,

and the good meets all the other applicable requirements of this Chapter.

Paragraph 1 shall apply only when using a non-originating material in the production of another good.

If a good described in paragraph 1 is also subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of those non-originating materials shall be included in the value of non-originating materials for the applicable regional value content requirement.
Article 3.10: Fungible Goods or Materials

Each Party shall provide that a fungible good or material is treated as originating based on the:
physical segregation of each fungible good or material; or

use of any inventory management method recognised in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles if the fungible good or material is commingled, provided that the inventory management method selected is used throughout the fiscal year of the person that selected the inventory management method.
Article 3.11: Accessories, Spare Parts, Tools and Instructional or Other Information Materials

Each Party shall provide that:

in determining whether a good is wholly obtained or satisfies a process or change in tariff classification requirement as set out in Annex 3-B, accessories, spare parts, tools or instructional or other information materials, as described in paragraph 3, are to be disregarded; and

in determining whether a good meets a regional value content requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts, tools or instructional or other information materials, as described in paragraph 3, are to be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.

Each Party shall provide that a good’s accessories, spare parts, tools or instructional or other information materials, as described in paragraph 3, have the originating status of the good with which they are delivered.

For the purposes of this Article, accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or other information materials are covered when:

the accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials are classified with, delivered with but not invoiced separately from the good; and

the types, quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials are customary for that good.
Article 3.12: Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale

Each Party shall provide that packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good, are disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good have satisfied the applicable process or change in tariff classification requirement set out in Annex 3-B or whether the good is wholly obtained or produced entirely.

Each Party shall provide that if a good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of the packaging materials and containers in which the good is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good, are taken into account as originating or non-originating, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.
Article 3.13: Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment

Each Party shall provide that packing materials and containers for shipment are disregarded in determining whether a good is originating.

Article 3.14: Indirect Materials

Each Party shall provide that an indirect material is considered to be originating without regard to where it is produced.

Article 3.15: Sets of Goods

Each Party shall provide that for a set classified as a result of the application of rule 3(a) or (b) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, the originating status of the set shall be determined in accordance with the product-specific rule of origin that applies to the set.

Each Party shall provide that for a set classified as a result of the application of rule 3(c) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, the set is originating only if each good in the set is originating and both the set and the goods meet the other applicable requirements of this Chapter.

Notwithstanding paragraph 2, for a set classified as a result of the application of rule 3(c) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, the set is originating if the value of all the non-originating goods in the set does not exceed 20 per cent of the value of the set.

For the purposes of paragraph 3, the value of the non-originating goods in the set and the value of the set shall be calculated in the same manner as the value of non-originating materials and the value of the good.
Article 3.16: Transport through non- Parties

Each Party shall provide that if an originating good is transported from the exporting Party to the importing Party through the territory of one or more non-Parties, the good retains its originating status provided that the good does not undergo subsequent production or any other operation in non-Parties, other than unloading, reloading, storing, separating from a bulk shipment, labelling or any other operation necessary to preserve it in good condition or to transport the good to the territory of the importing Party and the good remains under customs control in the territory of that or those non-Parties.
Section B: Origin Procedures

Article 3.17: Claims for Preferential Treatment

Each Party shall provide that an importer may make a claim for preferential tariff treatment, based on certificate of origin completed by the exporter, producer, or an authorised representative of the exporter or producer.

Each Party shall provide that the certificate of origin:

need not follow a prescribed format;

be in writing;

specifies that the good is both originating and meets the requirements of this Chapter;

contains a set of data requirements as set out in Annex 3-A; and

be in English or in Spanish. The importing Party may require the importer to submit a translation in the language of the importing Party.

Each Party shall provide that a certificate of origin may apply to:

a single shipment of a good into the territory of a Party; or

multiple shipments of identical goods within any period specified in the certificate of origin, from or after the date of issuance but not exceeding the period of validity of the certificate.

Each Party shall provide that the certificate of origin is valid for one year after the date that it was issued or for such longer period specified by the laws and regulations of the importing Party.
Article 3.18: Basis of a certificate of origin

Each Party shall provide that if a producer certifies the origin of a good, the certificate of origin is completed on the basis of the producer having information that the good is originating.

Each Party shall provide that if the exporter is not the producer of the good, the certificate of origin may be completed by the exporter of the good on the basis of:

the exporter having information that the good is originating; or

reasonable reliance on the producer’s information that the good is originating.

Each Party shall provide that a certificate of origin may be completed by an authorised representative of an exporter or producer of the good on the basis of reasonable reliance on supporting documentation provided by the exporter or producer that the good is originating.

For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be construed to allow a Party to require an exporter or producer to complete or provide a certificate of origin to another person.
Article 3.19: Discrepancies and Minor Errors

Each Party shall provide that it shall not reject a certificate of origin due to minor errors contained in it, such as typing errors, or discrepancies with other documentation2, provided the errors or discrepancies do not cast doubt on the origin of the good.

Article 3.20: Waiver of Certificate of Origin

Neither Party shall require a certificate of origin if:
the customs value of the importation does not exceed AUD $1000 for Australia or US $800 for Peru, or any higher amount as the importing Party may establish; or

it is a good for which the importing Party has waived the requirement or does not require the importer to present a certificate of origin, provided that the importation does not form part of a series of importations carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the importing Party’s laws governing claims for preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement.
Article 3.21: Obligations Relating to Importation

Except as otherwise provided for in this Chapter, each Party shall provide that, for the purpose of claiming preferential tariff treatment, the importer shall:

declare that the good qualifies as an originating good;

have valid a certificate of origin in its possession at the time the declaration referred to in subparagraph (a) is made;

provide a copy of the certificate of origin to the importing Party if required by the Party; and

if required by a Party to demonstrate that the requirements in Article 3.16 have been satisfied, provide transport documents, and in the case of storage, additional relevant documents, such as storage or customs documents. If the good has been transported directly from the territory of the exporting Party to the importing Party nothing shall prevent a Party from requiring the importer to present transport documents which show that the good has been transported from the territory of the exporting Party to the importing Party.

Each Party shall provide that, if the importer has reason to believe that the certificate of origin is based on incorrect information that could affect the accuracy or validity of the certificate of origin, the importer shall correct the importation document and pay any customs duty and, if applicable, penalties owed.

Neither Party shall subject an importer to a penalty for making an invalid claim for preferential tariff treatment if the importer, on becoming aware that such a claim is not valid and prior to discovery of the error by that Party, voluntarily corrects the claim and pays any applicable customs duty under the circumstances provided for in the Party’s law.
Article 3.22: Record Keeping Requirements

Each Party shall provide that an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into the territory of that Party shall maintain documentation related to the importation, including the certificate of origin that served as the basis for the claim, for a period of no less than five years from the date of importation of the good.

Each Party shall provide that a producer or exporter in its territory that provides a certificate of origin shall maintain all records necessary to demonstrate that a good for which the exporter or producer provided the certificate of origin is originating, for a period of no less than five years from the date the certificate of origin was issued.

Each Party shall provide that an importer, exporter or producer in its territory may choose to maintain the records specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 in any medium that allows for prompt retrieval, including electronic, optical, magnetic or written form in accordance with that Party’s law.
Article 3.23: Verification of Origin

For the purpose of determining whether a good imported into its territory is originating, the importing Party may conduct a verification of any claim for preferential tariff treatment by one or more of the following:

a written request for information from the importer of the good;

a written request for information from the exporter or producer of the good;

a verification visit to the premises of the exporter or producer of the good; or

other procedures as may be decided by the Parties.

If the importing Party conducts a verification, it shall accept information directly from the importer, exporter or producer.

In response to a request for information by the importing Party under paragraph 1(a), the importer does not provide information to the importing Party or the information provided is not sufficient to support a claim for preferential tariff treatment, the importing Party shall request information from the exporter or producer under paragraph 1(b) or 1(c) before it may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment. The importing Party shall complete the verification, including any additional request to the exporter or producer under paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), within the time provided in paragraph 6(e).

A written request for information or for a verification visit under paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c) shall:

be in English or in the official language of the Party of the person to whom the request is made;

include the identity of the government authority issuing the request;

state the reason for the request, including the specific issue the requesting Party seeks to resolve with the verification;

include sufficient information to identify the good that is being verified;

include a copy of relevant information submitted with the good, including the certificate of origin; and

in the case of a verification visit, request the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are going to be visited, and state the proposed date and location for the visit and its specific purpose.

If the importing Party has initiated a verification in accordance with paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), it shall inform the importer of the initiation of the verification.

For a verification under paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c), the importing Party shall:

ensure that a written request for information or for documentation to be reviewed during a verification visit, is limited to information and documentation to determine whether the good is originating;

describe the information or documentation in sufficient detail to allow the importer, exporter or producer to identify the information and documentation necessary to respond;

allow the importer, exporter or producer at least 45 days from the date of receipt of the written request for information under paragraph 1(a) or 1(b) to respond;

allow the exporter or producer 30 days from the date of receipt of the written request for a visit under paragraph 1(c) to consent or refuse the request; and

make a determination following a verification as expeditiously as possible and no later than 90 days after it receives the information necessary to make the determination, including, if applicable, any information received under paragraph 9, and no later than 365 days after the first request for information or other action under paragraph 1.

If the importing Party makes a verification request for information from an exporter or producer under paragraph 1(b), it shall inform the exporting Party. In addition, on request of the importing Party, the exporting Party may, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with its laws and regulations, assist with the verification. This assistance may include providing a contact point for the verification, collecting information from the exporter or producer on behalf of the importing Party, or other activities in order that the importing Party may make a determination as to whether the good is originating. The importing Party shall not deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment solely on the ground that the exporting Party did not provide requested assistance.

If the importing Party initiates a verification under paragraph 1(c), it shall, at the time of the request for the visit, inform the Party where the exporter or producer is located and provide the opportunity for the officials of the Party where the exporter or producer is located to accompany them during the visit.

Prior to issuing a written determination, the importing Party shall inform the importer and the exporter or producer that provided information directly to the importing Party, of the results of the verification and, if the importing Party intends to deny preferential tariff treatment, provide those persons a period of at least 30 days for the submission of additional information relating to the origin of the good.

The importing Party shall:

provide the importer with a written determination of whether the good is originating that includes the basis for the determination; and

provide the importer, exporter or producer that provided information during the verification or to the exporter or the producer that certified that the good was originating with the results of the verification and the reasons for that result.

During verification, the importing Party shall allow the release of the good, subject to payment of duties or provision of security as provided for in its law. If as a result of the verification the importing Party determines that the good is an originating good, it shall grant preferential tariff treatment to the good and refund any excess duties paid or release any security provided, unless the security also covers other obligations.

If verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct3 by an importer, exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations, statements, declarations or certificates relevant to a claim that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods imported, exported or produced by that person until that person demonstrates that the identical goods qualify as originating. For the purposes of this paragraph, “identical goods” means goods that are the same in all respects relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating.

For the purpose of a verification request, it is sufficient for a Party to rely on the contact information of an exporter, producer or importer in a Party provided in a certificate of origin.
Article 3.24: Determinations on Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2, each Party shall grant a claim for preferential tariff treatment made in accordance with this Chapter on or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

The importing Party may deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment if:

it determines that the good does not qualify for preferential treatment;

pursuant to a verification under Article 3.23, it has not received sufficient information to determine that the good qualifies as originating;

the exporter, producer or importer fails to respond to a written request for information in accordance with Article 3.23;

after receipt of a written notification for a verification visit, the exporter or producer does not provide its written consent in accordance with Article 3.23;

the importer, exporter or producer fails to comply with the requirements of this Chapter; or

the goods entered into home consumption of a Party before entry into force of the Agreement.

If the importing Party denies a claim for preferential tariff treatment, it shall issue a determination to the importer that includes the reasons for the determination.

A Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment for the sole reason that the invoice was issued in a non-Party, provided that the good covered by the certificate of origin corresponds to that described in any other documentation submitted to the importing Party.
Article 3.25: Refunds and Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment after Importation

Each Party shall provide that an importer may apply for preferential tariff treatment and a refund of any excess duties paid for a good, provided that the good would have qualified for preferential tariff treatment when it was imported into the territory of the Party.

As a condition for preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1, the importing Party may require that the importer:

make a claim for preferential tariff treatment;

provide a statement that the good was originating at the time of importation;

provide a copy of the certificate of origin; and

provide such other documentation relating to the importation of the good as the importing Party may require,

no later than one year after the date of importation or within a longer period if specified in the laws or regulations of the importing Party.
Article 3.26: Penalties

A Party may establish or maintain appropriate penalties for violations of its laws and regulations related to this Chapter.

Article 3.27: Confidentiality

Each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of the information collected in accordance with this Chapter and shall protect that information from disclosure that could prejudice the competitive position of the person providing the information.

Article 4.1: Customs Procedures

Each Party shall ensure that its customs procedures are applied in a manner that is predictable, consistent and transparent.

Article 4.2: Cooperations

With a view to facilitating the effective operation of this Agreement, each Party shall:

encourage cooperation with the other Party regarding significant customs issues that affect goods traded between the Parties; and

endeavour to provide the other Party with advance notice of any significant administrative change, modification of a law or regulation, or similar measure related to its laws or regulations that governs importations, exportations or transit, that is likely to substantially affect the operation of this Agreement.

Each Party shall, in accordance with its law, cooperate with the other Party through information sharing and other activities as appropriate, to achieve compliance with their respective laws and regulations that pertain to:

the implementation and operation of the provisions of this Agreement governing importations, exportations or transit, including claims for preferential tariff treatment, procedures for making claims for preferential tariff treatment and verification procedures;

the implementation, application and operation of the Customs Valuation Agreement;

restrictions or prohibitions on imports, exports or transit;

investigation and prevention of customs offences, including duty evasion and smuggling; and

other customs matters as the Parties may decide.

If a Party has a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity related to its laws or regulations governing importations, exportations or transit, it may request that the other Party provide specific confidential information that is normally collected in connection with the importation, exportation or transit of goods.

If a Party makes a request under paragraph 3, it shall:

be in writing;

specify the purpose for which the information is sought; and

identify the requested information with sufficient specificity for the other Party to locate and provide the information.

The Party from which the information is requested under paragraph 3 shall, subject to its law and any relevant international agreements to which it is a party, provide a written response containing the requested information.

For the purposes of paragraph 3, “a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity” means a suspicion based on relevant factual information obtained from public or private sources comprising one or more of the following:

historical evidence of non-compliance with laws or regulations that govern importations, exportations and transit by an importer or exporter;

historical evidence of non-compliance with laws or regulations that govern importations, exportations and transit by a manufacturer, producer or other person involved in the movement of goods from the territory of a Party to the territory of the other Party;

Each Party shall endeavour to provide the other Party with any other information that would assist that Party to determine whether imports from, or exports to, that Party are in compliance with the receiving Party’s laws or regulations that govern importations, exportations and transit, in particular those related to unlawful activities, including smuggling and similar infractions.

In order to facilitate trade between the Parties, a Party receiving a request shall endeavour to provide the other Party with technical advice and assistance for the purpose of:

developing and implementing improved best practices and risk management techniques;

facilitating the implementation of international supply chain standards;

simplifying and enhancing procedures for clearing goods through customs in a timely and efficient manner;

enhancing the use of technologies that can lead to improved compliance with the requesting Party’s laws or regulations that govern importations, exportations and transit.

The Parties shall endeavour to establish or maintain channels of communication for cooperation, including by establishing contact points in order to facilitate the rapid and secure exchange of information and improve coordination on importation issues.
Article 4.3: Advance Rulings

Each Party shall issue, prior to the importation of a good of the other Party into its territory, a written advance ruling at the written request of an importer in its territory, or an exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party, 1 with regard to:2

tariff classification;

the application of customs valuation criteria for a particular case in accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement;

whether a good is originating in accordance with Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures); and

such other matters as the Parties may decide.

Each Party shall issue an advance ruling as expeditiously as possible and in no case later than 150 days after it receives a request, provided that the requester has submitted all the information that the receiving Party requires to make the advance ruling. This includes a sample of the good for which the requester is seeking an advance ruling if requested by the receiving Party.

In issuing an advance ruling, the Party shall take into account the facts and circumstances that the requester has provided. For greater certainty, a Party may decline to issue an advance ruling if the facts and circumstances forming the basis of the advance ruling are the subject of administrative or judicial review. A Party that declines to issue an advance ruling shall promptly notify the requester in writing, setting out the relevant facts and circumstances and the basis for its decision to decline to issue the advance ruling.

Each Party shall provide that its advance rulings shall take effect on the date that they are issued or on another date specified in the ruling, and remain in effect for at least three years, provided that the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling is based remain unchanged. If a Party’s law provides that an advance ruling becomes ineffective after a fixed period of time, that Party shall endeavour to provide procedures that allow the requester to renew the ruling expeditiously before it becomes ineffective, in situations in which the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based remain unchanged.

After issuing an advance ruling, the Party may modify or revoke the advance ruling if there is a change in the law, facts or circumstances on which the ruling was based, if the ruling was based on inaccurate or false information, or if the ruling was in error.

A Party may apply a modification or revocation in accordance with paragraph 4 after it provides notice of the modification or revocation and the reasons for it.

Neither Party shall apply a revocation or modification retroactively to the detriment of the requester unless the ruling was based on inaccurate or false information provided by the requester.

Each Party shall ensure that requesters have access to administrative review of advance rulings.

Subject to any confidentiality requirements in its law, each Party shall endeavour to make its advance rulings publicly available, including online.
Article 4.4: Response to Requests for Advice or Information

On request from an importer in its territory, or an exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party, a Party shall expeditiously provide advice or information relevant to the facts contained in the request on:
the requirements for qualifying for quotas, such as tariff rate quotas;

the application of duty drawback, deferral or other types of relief that reduce, refund or waive customs duties;

the eligibility requirements for goods under Article 2.6 (Goods Re-entered after Repair and Alteration);

country of origin marking, if it is a prerequisite for importation; and

other matters as the Parties may decide.
Article 4.5: Review and Appeal

Each Party shall ensure that any person to whom it issues a determination3 on a customs matter has access to:

administrative review of the determination, independent4 of the employee or office that issued the determination; and

judicial review of the determination.

Each Party shall ensure that an authority that conducts a review under paragraph 1 notifies the parties to the matter in writing of its decision and the reasons for the decision. A Party may require a request as a condition for providing the reasons for a decision in the review.

provide for information necessary to release an express shipment to be submitted and processed before the shipment arrives;

allow a single submission of information covering all goods contained in an express shipment, such as a manifest, through, if possible, electronic means;5

to the extent possible, provide for the release of certain goods with a minimum of documentation;

under normal circumstances, provide for express shipments to be released within six hours after submission of the necessary customs documents, provided the shipment has arrived;

apply to shipments of any weight or value recognising that a Party may require formal entry procedures as a condition for release, including declaration and supporting documentation and payment of customs duties, based on the good’s weight or value; and

provide that, under normal circumstances, no customs duties will be assessed on express shipments valued at or below a fixed amount set under the Party’s law.6

If a Party does not provide the treatment in paragraph 1(a) through (f) to all shipments, that Party shall provide a separate 7 and expedited customs procedure that provides that treatment for express shipments.
Article 4.8: Penalties

Each Party shall adopt or maintain measures that allow for the imposition of a penalty by a Party’s customs administration for a breach of its customs laws, regulations or procedural requirements, including those governing tariff classification, customs valuation, country of origin and claims for preferential treatment under this Agreement.

Article 4.9: Risk Management

Each Party shall adopt or maintain a risk management system for assessment and targeting that enables its customs administration to focus its inspection activities on high-risk goods and that simplifies the clearance and movement of low-risk goods.

In order to facilitate trade, each Party shall periodically review and update, as appropriate, the risk management system specified in paragraph 1.
Article 4.10: Release of Goods

Each Party shall adopt or maintain simplified customs procedures for the efficient release of goods in order to facilitate trade between the Parties. This paragraph shall not require a Party to release a good if its requirements for release have not been met.

Pursuant to paragraph 1, each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that:

provide for the release of goods within a period no longer than that required to ensure compliance with its customs laws and, to the extent possible, within 48 hours of the arrival of the goods;

provide for the electronic submission and processing of customs information in advance of the arrival of the goods in order to expedite the release of goods from customs control upon arrival;

allow goods to be released at the point of arrival without temporary transfer to warehouses or other facilities; and

allow an importer to obtain the release of goods prior to the final determination of customs duties, taxes and fees by the importing Party’s customs administration when these are not determined prior to or promptly upon arrival, provided that the good is otherwise eligible for release and any security required by the importing Party has been provided or payment under protest, if required by a Party, has been made. Payment under protest refers to payment of duties, taxes and fees if the amount is in dispute and procedures are available to resolve the dispute.

If a Party allows for the release of goods conditioned on a security, it shall adopt or maintain procedures that:

ensure that the amount of the security is no greater than that required to ensure that obligations arising from the importation of the goods will be fulfilled;

ensure that the security shall be discharged as soon as possible after its customs administration is satisfied that the obligations arising from the importation of the goods have been fulfilled; and

allow importers to provide security using non-cash financial instruments, including, in appropriate cases where an importer frequently enters goods, instruments covering multiple entries.
Article 4.11: Publication

Each Party shall make publicly available, including online, its customs laws, regulations, and general administrative procedures and guidelines, to the extent possible in the English language.

Each Party shall designate or maintain one or more enquiry points to address enquiries from interested persons concerning customs matters and shall make information concerning the procedures for making such enquiries publicly available online.

To the extent possible, each Party shall publish in advance regulations of general application governing customs matters that it proposes to adopt and shall provide interested persons the opportunity to comment before the Party adopts the regulation.
Article 4.12: Confidentiality

If a Party provides information to the other Party in accordance with this Chapter and designates the information as confidential, the other Party shall keep the information confidential. The Party that provides the information may require the other Party to use it only for the purposes specified in the other Party’s request.

This Article shall not preclude the use or disclosure of information provided pursuant to this Chapter to the extent such use or disclosure is required by the domestic laws and regulations of the Party of the customs administration receiving the information. Such customs administration shall, whenever possible, give advance notice of any such disclosure to the customs administration providing information.

A Party may decline to provide information requested by the other Party if that Party has failed to act in accordance with paragraph 1.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures for protecting from unauthorised disclosure confidential information submitted in accordance with the administration of the Party’s customs laws, including information the disclosure of which could prejudice the competitive position of the person providing the information.

If the conditions in paragraph 1 are met, the Party may, to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment:

suspend the further reduction of any rate of customs duty provided for under this Agreement on the good; or

increase the rate of customs duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of:

the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect at the time the measure is applied; and

Neither Party shall apply or maintain tariff rate quotas nor quantitative restrictions as transitional safeguard measures.

Neither Party shall apply or maintain a transitional safeguard measure to any product imported under a tariff rate quota established by the Party under this Agreement.

Neither Party shall apply a transitional safeguard measure against an originating good of the other Party where the exporting Party’s share of imports of the originating good in the importing Party does not exceed three per cent.
Article 5.4: Investigation Procedures and Transparency Requirements

A Party shall apply a transitional safeguard measure only following an investigation by the Party’s competent authorities in accordance with Article 3 and Article 4.2 of the Safeguards Agreement; to this end, Article 3 and Article 4.2 of the Safeguards Agreement are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement mutatis mutandis.
Article 5.5: Standards for a Transitional Safeguard Measure

A Party shall maintain a transitional safeguard measure only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment.

That period shall not exceed two years, except that the period may be extended by up to one year if the competent authority of the Party that applies the measure determines, in conformity with the procedures set out in Article 5.4, that the transitional safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy further or ongoing serious injury and to facilitate adjustment.

in the case of an extension of the transitional safeguard measure, evidence that the domestic industry concerned is adjusting.

On request of the Party whose good is subject to a proceeding for the application or extension of a transitional safeguard under this Chapter, the other Party shall enter into consultations with the requesting Party to review a notification under paragraph 1 or any public notice or report that the competent investigating authority issued in connection with that proceeding.
Article 5.7: Compensation

A Party applying or extending a transitional safeguard measure shall, in consultation with the other Party, provide mutually agreed trade liberalising compensation in the form of concessions that have substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the transitional safeguard measure. The Party shall provide an opportunity for those consultations no later than 30 days after the application of the transitional safeguard measure.

If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an agreement on trade liberalising compensation within 30 days, a Party against whose good the transitional safeguard measure is applied may suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the trade of the other Party.

The Party against whose good the transitional safeguard measure is applied shall notify the other Party in writing at least 30 days before it suspends concessions in accordance with paragraph 2.

The Committee shall establish its terms of reference at its first meeting and may revise those terms as needed.

The Committee shall meet within one year of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and on annual basis, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The Committee may meet face to face, via videoconference, teleconference, or any other means as agreed by the Parties.
Article 6.6: Adaptation to Regional Conditions, Including Pest- or Disease-Free Areas and Areas of Low Pest or Disease Prevalence

The Parties recognise that adaptation to regional conditions is an important means to facilitate trade.

The Parties shall take into account the relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations.

The Parties may cooperate on the recognition of pest- or disease-free areas, and areas of low pest or disease prevalence with the objective of acquiring confidence in the procedures followed by each Party for the recognition of pest- or disease-free areas, and areas of low pest or disease prevalence.

When the importing Party receives a request for a determination of regional conditions from the exporting Party and determines that the information provided by the exporting Party is sufficient, it shall initiate an assessment within a reasonable period of time.

When the importing Party commences an assessment of a request for a determination of regional conditions under paragraph 4, that Party shall promptly, on request of the exporting Party, explain its process for making the determination of regional conditions.

On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party of the status of the assessment of the exporting Party’s request for a determination of regional conditions.

When the importing Party adopts a measure that recognises specific regional conditions of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall communicate that measure to the exporting Party in writing, and implement the measure within a reasonable period of time.

If the evaluation of the information provided by the exporting Party does not result in a determination to recognise regional conditions, the importing Party shall provide the exporting Party with the rationale for its determination.
Article 6.7: Equivalence

The Parties acknowledge that recognition of the equivalence of SPS measures is an important means to facilitate trade. Further to Article 4 of the WTO SPS Agreement, the Parties shall apply equivalence to a group of measures or on a systems-wide basis, to the extent feasible and appropriate. In determining the equivalence of a specific SPS measure, group of measures or on a systems-wide basis, each Party shall take into account the relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations.

When an importing Party receives a request for an equivalence assessment and determines that the information provided by the exporting Party is sufficient, it shall initiate the equivalence assessment within a reasonable period of time.

In determining the equivalence of an SPS measure, an importing Party shall take into account available knowledge, information and relevant experience, as well as the regulatory competence of the exporting Party.

When an importing Party adopts a measure that recognises the equivalence of an exporting Party’s specific SPS measure, group of measures or measures on a systems-wide basis, the importing Party shall communicate the measure it has adopted to the exporting Party in writing and implement the measure within a reasonable period of time.
Article 6.8: Science and Risk Analysis

The Parties recognise the importance of ensuring that their respective SPS measures are based on scientific principles.

Each Party shall ensure that its SPS measures either conform to the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations or, if its SPS measures do not conform to international standards, guidelines or recommendations, that they are based on documented and objective scientific evidence that is rationally related to the measures, while recognising the Parties’ obligations regarding assessment of risk under Article 5 of the SPS Agreement.

Recognising the Parties’ rights and obligations under the relevant provisions of the SPS Agreement, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from:

establishing the level of protection it determines to be appropriate;

establishing or maintaining an approval procedure that requires a risk analysis to be conducted before the Party grants a product access to its market; or

adopting or maintaining an SPS measure on a provisional basis.

Each Party shall conduct its risk analysis in a manner that is documented and that provides the other Party an opportunity to comment, in a manner to be determined by the Party conducting the risk analysis 1.

Each Party shall ensure that each risk assessment it conducts is appropriate to the circumstances of the risk at issue and takes into account reasonably available and relevant scientific data, including qualitative and quantitative information.

If the importing Party requires a risk analysis to evaluate a request from the exporting Party to authorise importation of a good of that exporting Party, the importing Party shall provide, on request of the exporting Party, an explanation of the information required for the risk assessment. On receipt of the required information from the exporting Party, the importing Party shall endeavour to facilitate the evaluation of the request for authorisation by scheduling work on this request in accordance with the procedures, policies, resources, and laws and regulations of the importing Party.

On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party of the progress of a specific risk analysis request, and of any delay that may occur during the process.

If the importing Party, as a result of a risk analysis, adopts an SPS measure that allows trade to commence or resume, the importing Party shall implement the measure within a reasonable period of time.
Article 6.9: Transparency

The Parties recognise the value of sharing information about their SPS measures on an ongoing basis, and of providing the other Party with the opportunity to comment on their proposed SPS measures.

Each Party shall notify the other Party of a proposed SPS measure that may have a significant effect on the trade of the other Party, including any that conforms to international standards, guidelines or recommendations, by using the WTO SPS notification submission system.

Unless urgent problems of human, animal or plant life or health protection arise or threaten to arise, or the measure is of a trade-facilitating nature, a Party shall normally allow at least 60 days for interested persons and the other Party to provide written comments on the proposed measure after it makes the notification under paragraph 2. If feasible and appropriate, the Party should allow more than 60 days. The Party shall consider any reasonable request from the other Party to extend the comment period. On request of the other Party, the Party shall respond to the written comments of the other Party in an appropriate manner.
Article 6.10: Contact Points

The Parties designate the following contact points on SPS Measures to facilitate communications between the Parties on any matter covered by this Chapter:

for Australia, the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, or its successor; and

for Peru, the Vice Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism, or its successor.

Article 7.2: Objective

The objective of this Chapter is to facilitate trade, including by eliminating unnecessary technical barriers to trade, enhancing transparency, and promoting greater regulatory cooperation and good regulatory practice.

Article 7.3: Scope

This Chapter shall apply to the preparation, adoption, and application of all standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures of the central level of government, as defined in the TBT Agreement, that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods between the Parties.

Each Party shall take reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure compliance with this Chapter by regional or local governments and non-governmental bodies within its territory which are responsible for the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures.

All references in this Chapter to technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures shall be construed to include any amendments to them and any addition to the rules or the product coverage of those technical regulations, standards and procedures, except amendments and additions of an insignificant nature.

This Chapter shall not apply to technical specifications prepared by a governmental entity for its production or consumption requirements. These specifications are covered by Chapter 14 (Government Procurement).

This Chapter shall not apply to sanitary and phytosanitary measures. These are covered by Chapter 6 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures).
Article 7.4: Affirmation of the TBT Agreement

The Parties affirm their rights and obligations with respect to each other under the TBT Agreement.

Article 7.5: International Standards, Guides and Recommendations

The Parties recognise the important role that international standards, guides and recommendations can play in supporting greater regulatory alignment, good regulatory practice and reducing unnecessary barriers to trade.

In this respect, and further to Articles 2.4 and 5.4 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, to determine whether there is an international standard, guide or recommendation within the meaning of Articles 2 and 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall apply the Decisions and Recommendations adopted by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade Since 1 January 1995 (G/TBT/1/Rev.13), as may be revised, issued by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.

The Parties shall cooperate with each other, when feasible and appropriate, to ensure that international standards, guides and recommendations that are likely to become a basis for technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
Article 7.6: Conformity Assessment

Further to Article 6.4 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall accord to conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to conformity assessment bodies located in its own territory. In order to ensure that it accords such treatment, each Party shall apply the same or equivalent procedures, criteria and other conditions to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognise conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the other Party that it may apply to conformity assessment bodies in its own territory.

Further to Article 9.1 of the TBT Agreement, a Party shall consider adopting measures to approve conformity assessment bodies that have accreditation for the technical regulations or standards of the importing Party, by an accreditation body that is a signatory to an international or regional mutual recognition arrangement. The Parties recognise that these arrangements can address the key considerations in approving conformity assessment bodies, including technical competence, independence, and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.

A Party shall publish, preferably by electronic means, any procedures, criteria and other conditions that it may use as the basis for determining whether conformity assessment bodies are competent to receive accreditation, approval, licensing or other recognition, including accreditation, approval, licensing or other recognition granted pursuant to a mutual recognition agreement.

If a Party:

accredits, approves, licenses or otherwise recognises a body assessing conformity with a particular technical regulation or standard in its territory, and refuses to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognise a body assessing conformity with that technical regulation or standard in the territory of the other Party; or

declines to use a mutual recognition arrangement,

it shall, on request of the other Party, explain the reasons for its decision.

If a Party does not accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of the other Party, it shall, on the request of the other Party, explain the reasons for its decision.

Further to Article 6.3 of the TBT Agreement, if a Party declines the request of the other Party to enter into negotiations to conclude an agreement for mutual recognition of the results of each other’s conformity assessment procedures, it shall, on request of the other Party, explain the reasons for its decision.
Article 7.7: Transparency

Each Party shall allow persons of the other Party to participate in the development of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures by its central government bodies 1 on terms no less favourable than those that it accords to its own persons.

Each Party is encouraged to consider methods to provide additional transparency in the development of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures, including through the use of electronic tools and public outreach or consultations.

If appropriate, each Party shall encourage non-governmental bodies in its territory to observe the obligations in paragraphs 1 and 2.

Each Party shall publish all proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and proposals for amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and all new final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and final amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, of central government bodies.

Each Party shall publish preferably by electronic means, in a single official journal or website, all proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and proposals for amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and all new final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and final amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, of central government bodies, that a Party is required to notify or publish under the TBT Agreement or this Chapter, and that may have a significant effect on trade.2

Each Party shall notify proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures that are in accordance with the technical content of relevant international standards, guides or recommendations, if any, and that may have a significant effect on trade, according to the procedures established under Article 2.9 or 5.6 of the TBT Agreement.

Notwithstanding paragraph 6, if urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise for a Party, that Party may notify a new technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that is in accordance with the technical content of relevant international standards, guides or recommendations, if any, upon the adoption of that regulation or procedure, according to the procedures established under Article 2.10 or 5.7 of the TBT Agreement.

For the purposes of determining whether a proposed technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure may have a significant effect on trade and should be notified in accordance with Article 2.9, 2.10, 3.2, 5.6, 5.7 or 7.2 of the TBT Agreement or this Chapter, a Party shall consider, among other things, the relevant Decisions and Recommendations Adopted by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade Since 1 January 1995 (G/TBT/1/Rev. 13), as may be revised.

A Party that publishes a notice and that files a notification in accordance with Article 2.9, 3.2, 5.6 or 7.2 of the TBT Agreement or this Chapter shall:

include in the notification an explanation of the objectives of the proposal and how it would address those objectives; and

transmit the notification and the proposal electronically to the other Party through their enquiry points established in accordance with Article 10 of the TBT Agreement, at the same time as it notifies WTO Members.

Each Party shall normally allow 60 days from the date it transmits a proposal under paragraph 13 for the other Party or an interested person of the other Party to provide comments in writing on the proposal. A Party shall consider any reasonable request from the other Party or an interested person of the other Party to extend the comment period. A Party that is able to extend a time limit beyond 60 days, for example 90 days, is encouraged to do so.

Each Party is encouraged to provide sufficient time between the end of the comment period and the adoption of the notified technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, for its consideration of, and preparation of responses to, the comments received.

Each Party shall endeavour to notify the final text of a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure at the time the text is adopted or published, as an addendum to the original notification of the proposed measure filed under Article 2.9, 3.2, 5.6 or 7.2 of the TBT Agreement or this Chapter.

A Party that files a notification in accordance with Article 2.10 or 5.7 of the TBT Agreement and this Chapter shall, at the same time, transmit the notification and text of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure electronically to the other Party through the enquiry points referred to in paragraph 9(b).
Article 7.8: Compliance Period for Technical Regulations and Conformity Assessment Procedures

For the purposes of applying Articles 2.12 and 5.9 of the TBT Agreement the term “reasonable interval” means normally a period of not less than six months, except when this would be ineffective in fulfilling the legitimate objectives pursued by the technical regulation or by the requirements concerning the conformity assessment procedure.

If feasible and appropriate, each Party shall endeavour to provide an interval of more than six months between the publication of final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and their entry into force.

In addition to paragraphs 1 and 2, in setting a “reasonable interval” for a specific technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, each Party shall ensure that it provides suppliers with a reasonable period of time, under the circumstances, to be able to demonstrate the conformity of their goods with the relevant requirements of the technical regulation or standard by the date of entry into force of the specific technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure. In doing so, each Party shall endeavour to take into account the resources available to suppliers.
Article 7.9: Cooperation and Trade Facilitation

Further to Articles 5, 6 and 9 of the TBT Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the acceptance of conformity assessment results. In this regard, a Party may:

implement mutual recognition of the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by bodies located in its territory and the other Party’s territory with respect to specific technical regulations;

recognise existing regional and international mutual recognition arrangements between or among accreditation bodies or conformity assessment bodies;

use accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies, particularly international systems of accreditation;

designate conformity assessment bodies or recognise the other Party’s designation of conformity assessment bodies;

unilaterally recognise the results of conformity assessment procedures performed in the other Party’s territory; and

accept a supplier’s declaration of conformity.

The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to support greater regulatory alignment and to eliminate unnecessary technical barriers to trade, including:

regulatory dialogue and cooperation to, among other things:

exchange information on regulatory approaches and practices;

promote the use of good regulatory practices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures;

provide technical advice and assistance, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, to improve practices related to the development, implementation and review of technical regulations, standards, conformity assessment procedures and metrology; or

provide technical assistance and cooperation, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, to build capacity and support the implementation of this Chapter;

greater alignment of national standards with relevant international standards, except where inappropriate or ineffective;

facilitation of the greater use of relevant international standards, guides and recommendations as the basis for technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures; and

promotion of the acceptance of technical regulations of the other Party as equivalent.

With respect to the mechanisms listed in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Parties recognise that the choice of the appropriate mechanism in a given regulatory context depends on a variety of factors, such as the product and sector involved, the volume and direction of trade, the relationship between Parties’ respective regulators, the legitimate objectives pursued and the risks of non-fulfilment of those objectives.

The Parties shall strengthen their exchange and collaboration on mechanisms to facilitate the acceptance of conformity assessment results, to support greater regulatory alignment and to eliminate unnecessary technical barriers to trade.

A Party shall, on request of the other Party, give due consideration to any sector-specific proposal for cooperation under this Chapter.

Further to Article 2.7 of the TBT Agreement, a Party shall, on request of the other Party, explain the reasons why it has not accepted a technical regulation of the other Party as equivalent.

The Parties shall encourage cooperation between their respective organisations responsible for standardisation, conformity assessment, accreditation and metrology, whether they are public or private, with a view to addressing issues covered by this Chapter.
Article 7.10: Information Exchange and Technical Discussions

A Party may request the other Party to provide information on any matter arising under this Chapter. A Party receiving a request under this paragraph shall provide that information within a reasonable period of time, and if possible, by electronic means.

A Party may request technical discussions with the other Party with the aim of resolving any matter that arises under this Chapter.

The Parties shall discuss the matter raised within 60 days of the date of the request. If the requesting Party considers that the matter is urgent, it may request that any discussions take place within a shorter time frame. The responding Party shall give positive consideration to that request.

The Parties shall endeavour to resolve the matter as expeditiously as possible, recognising that the time required to resolve a matter will depend on a variety of factors, and that it may not be possible to resolve every matter through technical discussions.

Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the discussions and any information exchanged in the course of the discussions shall be confidential and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement, the WTO Agreement or any other agreement to which both Parties are party.

Where the Parties have had recourse to technical discussions under paragraph 2, such technical discussions shall constitute consultations under Article 27.5 (Consultations) should a Party request the establishment of a dispute settlement Panel on the matter under Article 27.7 (Establishment of a Panel).

Requests for information or technical discussions shall be conveyed through the respective contact points designated pursuant to Article 7.11.
Article 7.11: Contact Points

Each Party shall designate and notify a contact point for matters arising under this Chapter, in accordance with Article 26.5 (Contact Points).

A Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any change of its contact point or the details of the relevant officials.

The responsibilities of each contact point shall include:

communicating with the other Party’s contact points, including facilitating discussions, requests and the timely exchange of information on matters arising under this Chapter;

communicating with and coordinating the involvement of relevant government agencies, including regulatory authorities, in its territory on relevant matters pertaining to this Chapter;

consulting and, if appropriate, coordinating with interested persons in its territory on relevant matters pertaining to this Chapter.

WINE AND DISTILLED SPIRITS

This Annex shall apply to wine and distilled spirits.

For the purposes of this Annex:

container means any bottle, barrel, cask or other closed receptacle, irrespective of size or of the material from which it is made, used for the retail sale of wine or distilled spirits;

distilled spirits mean a potable alcoholic distillate, including spirits of wine, whiskey, rum, brandy, gin, tequila, mezcal and all dilutions or mixtures of those spirits for consumption;

label means any brand, mark, pictorial or other descriptive matter that is written, printed, stencilled, marked, embossed or impressed on, or firmly affixed to the primary container of wine or distilled spirits;

oenological practices mean winemaking materials, processes, treatments and techniques, but does not include labelling, bottling or packaging for final sale;

single field of vision means any part of the surface of a primary container, excluding its base and cap, that can be seen without having to turn the container;

supplier means a producer, importer, exporter, bottler or wholesaler; and

wine means a beverage that is produced by the complete or partial alcoholic fermentation exclusively of fresh grapes, grape must, or products derived from fresh grapes in accordance with oenological practices that the country in which the wine is produced authorises under its laws and regulations.

Each Party shall make information about its laws and regulations concerning wine and distilled spirits publicly available.

A Party may require a supplier to ensure that any statement required by that Party to be placed on a wine or distilled spirits label is:

clear, specific, truthful, accurate and not misleading to the consumer; and

legible to the consumer; and

that such labels be firmly affixed.

If a Party requires a supplier to indicate information on a distilled spirits label, the Party shall permit the supplier to indicate that information on a supplementary label that is affixed to the distilled spirits container. Each Party shall permit a supplier to affix the supplementary label on the container of the imported distilled spirits after importation but prior to offering the product for sale in the Party’s territory, and may require that the supplier affix the supplementary label prior to release from customs. For greater certainty, a Party may require that the information indicated on a supplementary label meet the requirements in paragraph 4.

Each Party shall permit the alcoholic content by volume indicated on a wine or distilled spirits label to be expressed by alcohol by volume (alc/vol), for example 12% alc/vol or alc12%vol, and to be indicated in percentage terms to a maximum of one decimal point, for example 12.1%.

Each Party shall permit suppliers to use the term “wine” as a product name. A Party may require a supplier to indicate additional information on a wine label concerning the type, category, class or classification of the wine.

With respect to wine labels, each Party shall permit the information set out in subparagraphs 10(a) through (d) to be presented in a single field of vision for a container of wine. If this information is presented in a single field of vision, then the Party’s requirements with respect to placement of this information are satisfied. A Party shall accept any of the information that appears outside a single field of vision if that information satisfies that Party’s laws, regulations and requirements.

Notwithstanding paragraph 8, a Party may require net contents to be displayed on the principal display panel for a subset of less commonly used container sizes if specifically required by that Party's laws or regulations.

If a Party requires a wine label to indicate information other than:

product name;

country of origin;

net contents; or

alcohol content,

it shall permit the supplier to indicate the information on a supplementary label affixed to the wine container. A Party shall permit the supplier to affix the supplementary label on the container of the imported wine after importation but prior to offering the product for sale in the Party’s territory, and may require that the supplier affix the supplementary label prior to release from customs. For greater certainty, a Party may require that information on a supplementary label meet the requirements set out in paragraph 4.

For the purposes of paragraphs 4, 5 and 10, if there is more than one label on a container of imported wine or distilled spirits, a Party may require that each label be visible and not obscure mandatory information on another label.

Each Party shall permit a supplier to place a lot identification code on a wine or distilled spirits container, if the code is clear, specific, truthful, accurate and not misleading, and shall permit the supplier to determine:

where to place the lot identification code on the container, provided that the code does not cover up essential information printed on the label; and

the specific font size, readable phrasing and formatting for the code provided that the lot identification code is legible by physical or electronic means.

A Party may impose penalties for the removal or deliberate defacement of any lot identification code provided by the supplier and placed on the container.

For wine or distilled spirits with more than 10 per cent alcohol by volume, neither Party shall require a supplier to indicate any of the following information on a wine or distilled spirits container, labels or packaging:

date of production or manufacture;

date of expiration;

date of minimum durability; or

sell by date,

except that a Party may require a supplier to indicate a date of minimum durability or expiration on products that could have a shorter date of minimum durability or expiration than would normally be expected by the consumer because of: their packaging or container, for example bag-in-box wines or individual serving size wines; or the addition of perishable ingredients.

Neither Party shall require a supplier to place a translation of a trademark or trade name on a wine or distilled spirits container, label or packaging.

Neither Party shall prevent imports of wine from the other Party solely on the basis that the wine label includes the following descriptors or adjectives describing the wine or relating to wine-making: chateau, classic, clos, cream, crusted/crusting, fine, late bottled vintage, noble, reserve, ruby, special reserve, solera, superior, sur lie, tawny, vintage or vintage character.

Neither Party shall require a supplier to disclose an oenological practice on a wine label or container except to meet a legitimate human health or safety objective with respect to that oenological practice.

Each Party shall endeavour to base its quality and identity requirements for any specific type, category, class or classification of distilled spirits solely on minimum ethyl alcohol content and the raw materials, added ingredients and production procedures used to produce that specific type, category, class or classification of distilled spirits.

Neither Party shall require imported wine or distilled spirits to be certified by an official certification body of the Party in whose territory the wine or distilled spirits were produced or by a certification body recognised by the Party in whose territory the wine or distilled spirits were produced regarding:

vintage, varietal and regional claims for wine; or

raw materials and production processes for distilled spirits,

except that the Party may require that wine or distilled spirits be certified regarding (a) or (b) if the Party in whose territory the wine or distilled spirits were produced requires that certification, that wine be certified regarding (a) if the Party has a reasonable and legitimate concern about a vintage, varietal or regional claim for wine, or that distilled spirits be certified regarding (b) if certification is necessary to verify claims such as age, origin or standards of identity.

If a Party deems that certification of wine is necessary to protect human health or safety or to achieve other legitimate objectives, that Party shall consider the Codex Alimentarius Guidelines for Design, Production, Issuance and Use of Generic Official Certificates (CAC/GL 38-2001), in particular the use of the generic model official certificate, as amended from time-to-time, concerning official and officially recognised certificates.

A Party shall normally permit a wine or distilled spirits supplier to submit any required certification, test result or sample only with the initial shipment of a particular brand, producer and lot. If a Party requires a supplier to submit a sample of the product for the Party’s procedure to assess conformity with its technical regulation or standard, it shall not require a sample quantity larger than the minimum quantity necessary to complete the relevant conformity assessment procedure. Nothing in this provision precludes a Party from undertaking verification of test results or certification, for example, where the Party has information that a particular product may be non-compliant.

Unless problems of human health or safety arise or threaten to arise for a Party, a Party shall not normally apply any final technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure to wine or distilled spirits that have been placed on the market in the Party’s territory before the date of entry into force of the technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure, provided that the products are sold within a period of time after the date of entry into force of the technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure, stipulated by the authority responsible for that technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure.
ANNEX 7-B

ORGANIC PRODUCTS

This Annex shall apply to a Party if that Party adopts or maintains technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing or labelling of products as organic for sale or distribution within its territory.

Each Party is encouraged to take steps to:

exchange information on matters that relate to organic production, certification of organic products, and related control systems; and

cooperate with the other Party to develop, improve and strengthen international guidelines, standards and recommendations that relate to trade in organic products.

If a Party maintains a requirement that relates to the production, processing or labelling of products as organic, it shall enforce that requirement.

Each Party is encouraged to consider, as expeditiously as possible, a request from the other Party for recognition or equivalence of a technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relates to the production, processing, or labelling of products of the other Party as organic. Each Party is encouraged to accept as equivalent or recognise the technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing or labelling of products of the other Party as organic, if the Party is satisfied that the technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures of the other Party adequately fulfils the objectives of the Party’s technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures. If a Party does not accept as equivalent or recognise the technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing, or labelling of products of the other Party as organic, it shall, on request of the other Party, explain its reasons.

Each Party is encouraged to participate in technical exchanges to support improvement and greater alignment of technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing or labelling of products as organic.

covered investments; and

with respect to Article 8.10 and Article 8.16, all investments in the territory of that Party.

A Party’s obligations under this Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by:

the central, regional or local governments or authorities of that Party; and

any person, including a state enterprise or any other body, when it exercises any governmental authority delegated to it by central, regional or local governments or authorities of that Party.6

For greater certainty, this Chapter shall not bind a Party in relation to an act or fact that took place or a situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.
Article 8.3: Relation to Other Chapters

In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter of this Agreement, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

A requirement of a Party that a service supplier of the other Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to measures adopted or maintained by the Party relating to such cross-border supply of the service. This Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by the Party relating to the posted bond or financial security, to the extent that the bond or financial security is a covered investment.

This Chapter shall not apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter 10 (Financial Services).
Article 8.4: National Treatment 7

Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.

Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.

For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.
Article 8.5: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment

Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.

Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of investors of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.

For greater certainty, the treatment referred to in this Article does not encompass international dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms, such as those included in Section B.
Article 8.6: Minimum Standard of Treatment 8

Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with applicable customary international law principles, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security” do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligations in paragraph 1 to provide:

“fair and equitable treatment” includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and

“full protection and security” requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.

A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.

For greater certainty, the mere fact that a Party takes or fails to take an action that may be inconsistent with an investor’s expectations does not constitute a breach of this Article, even if there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result.

For greater certainty, the mere fact that a subsidy or grant has not been issued, renewed or maintained, or has been modified or reduced, by a Party, does not constitute a breach of this Article, even if there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result.
Article 8.7: Treatment in Case of Armed Conflict or Civil Strife

Notwithstanding Article 8.12.6(b), each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and to covered investments non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil strife.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, if an investor of a Party, in a situation referred to in paragraph 1, suffers a loss in the territory of the other Party resulting from:

requisitioning of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter’s forces or authorities; or

destruction of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter’s forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,

the latter Party shall provide the investor restitution, compensation or both, as appropriate, for that loss.

Paragraph 1 shall not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies or grants that would be inconsistent with Article 8.4 but for Article 8.12.6(b).
Article 8.8: Expropriation and Compensation 9

Neither Party shall expropriate or nationalise a covered investment, either directly or indirectly, through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalisation (expropriation), except:

for a public purpose;10

in a non-discriminatory manner;

on payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4; and

in accordance with due process of law.

Compensation shall:

be paid without delay;

be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (the date of expropriation);

not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier; and

be fully realisable and freely transferable.

If the fair market value is denominated in a freely usable currency, the compensation paid shall be no less than the fair market value on the date of expropriation, plus interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.

If the fair market value is denominated in a currency that is not freely usable, the compensation paid, converted into the currency of payment at the market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, shall be no less than:

the fair market value on the date of expropriation, converted into a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date; plus

interest, at a commercially reasonable rate for that freely usable currency, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.

This Article shall not apply to the issuance of compulsory licences granted in relation to intellectual property rights in accordance with the TRIPS Agreement, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that the issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with Chapter 17 (Intellectual Property) and the TRIPS Agreement.11

For greater certainty, a Party’s decision not to issue, renew or maintain a subsidy or grant, or decision to modify or reduce a subsidy or grant,

in the absence of any specific commitment under law or contract to issue, renew or maintain that subsidy or grant; or

in accordance with any terms or conditions attached to the issuance, renewal, modification, reduction and maintenance of that subsidy or grant,

standing alone, does not constitute an expropriation.
Article 8.9: Transfers

Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to a covered investment to be made freely and without delay into and out of its territory. Such transfers include:

contributions to capital;12

profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management fees, technical assistance fees and other fees;

proceeds from the sale of all or any part of the covered investment or from the partial or complete liquidation of the covered investment;

payments made under a contract, including a loan agreement;

payments made pursuant to Article 8.7 and Article 8.8; and

payments arising out of a dispute.

Each Party shall permit transfers relating to a covered investment to be made in a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing at the time of transfer.

Each Party shall permit returns in kind relating to a covered investment to be made as authorised or specified in a written agreement between the Party and a covered investment or an investor of the other Party.

Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, a Party may prevent or delay a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws and regulations13 relating to:

bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors;

issuing, trading or dealing in securities, futures, options or derivatives;

criminal or penal offences;

financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities; or

ensuring compliance with orders or judgments in judicial or administrative proceedings.

Notwithstanding paragraph 3, a Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict such transfers under this Agreement, including as set out in paragraph 4.
Article 8.10: Performance Requirements

Neither Party shall, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, impose or enforce any requirement, or enforce any commitment or undertaking:14

to export a given level or percentage of goods or services;

to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;

to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from persons in its territory;

to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with the investment;

to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that the investment produces or supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings;

to transfer a particular technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory; or

to supply exclusively from the territory of the Party the goods that the investment produces or the services that it supplies to a specific regional market or to the world market.

Neither Party shall condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, on compliance with any requirement:

to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;

to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from persons in its territory;

to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with the investment; or

to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that the investment produces or supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings.

Nothing in paragraph 2 shall be construed to prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, supply a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory.

Paragraph 1(f) shall not apply:

if a Party authorises use of an intellectual property right in accordance with the TRIPS Agreement, or to measures requiring the disclosure of proprietary information that fall within the scope of, and are consistent with, Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement; or

if the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced by a court, administrative tribunal or competition authority to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anticompetitive under the Party’s competition laws and regulations.15

Paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), 2(a) and 2(b) shall not apply to qualification requirements for goods or services with respect to export promotion and foreign aid programs.

Paragraphs 1(b), 1(c), 1(f), 1(g), 2(a) and 2(b) shall not apply to government procurement.

Paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) shall not apply to requirements imposed by an importing Party relating to the content of goods necessary to qualify for preferential tariffs or preferential quotas.

For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, from imposing or enforcing a requirement, or enforcing a commitment or undertaking, to employ or train workers in its territory provided that the employment or training does not require the transfer of a particular technology, production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory.

For greater certainty, paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to any commitment, undertaking or requirement other than those set out in those paragraphs.

This Article does not preclude enforcement of any commitment, undertaking or requirement between private parties, if a Party did not impose or require the commitment, undertaking or requirement.
Article 8.11: Senior Management and Boards of Directors

Neither Party shall require that an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment appoint to a senior management position a natural person of any particular nationality.

A Party may require that a majority of the board of directors, or any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment, be of a particular nationality or resident in the territory of the Party, provided that the requirement does not materially impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its investment.
Article 8.12: Non-Conforming Measures

Article 8.4, Article 8.5, Article 8.10 and Article 8.11 shall not apply to:

any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party at:

the central level of government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I;

a regional level of government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I; or

a local level of government;

the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); or

an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a), to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with Article 8.4, Article 8.5, Article 8.10 or Article 8.11.

Article 8.4, Article 8.5, Article 8.10 and Article 8.11 shall not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, subsectors or activities, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex II.

Neither Party shall, under any measure adopted after the date of entry into force of this Agreement and covered by its Schedule to Annex II, require an investor of the other Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment existing at the time the measure becomes effective.

Article 8.4 shall not apply to any measure that falls within an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by:

Article 17.8 (National Treatment); or

Article 3 of the TRIPS Agreement, if the exception or derogation relates to matters not addressed by Chapter 17 (Intellectual Property).

Article 8.5 shall not apply to any measure that falls within Article 5 of the TRIPS Agreement, or an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by:

Article 17.8 (National Treatment); or

Article 4 of the TRIPS Agreement.

Article 8.4, Article 8.5 and Article 8.11 shall not apply to:

government procurement; or

subsidies or grants provided by a Party, including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance.

For greater certainty, any amendments or modifications to a Party’s Schedules to Annex I or Annex II, pursuant to this Article, shall be made in accordance with Article 29.2 (Amendments).
Article 8.13: Subrogation

If a Party, or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation designated by the Party, makes a payment to an investor of the Party under a guarantee, a contract of insurance or other form of indemnity that it has entered into with respect to a covered investment, the other Party in whose territory the covered investment was made shall recognise the subrogation or transfer of any rights the investor would have possessed under this Chapter with respect to the covered investment but for the subrogation, and the investor shall be precluded from pursuing these rights to the extent of the subrogation.

Article 8.14: Special Formalities and Information Requirements

Nothing in Article 8.4 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with a covered investment, such as a residency requirement for registration or a requirement that a covered investment be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that these formalities do not materially impair the protections afforded by the Party to investors of the other Party and covered investments pursuant to this Chapter.

Notwithstanding Article 8.4 and Article 8.5, a Party may require an investor of the other Party or its covered investment to provide information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes. The Party shall protect such information that is confidential from any disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the covered investment. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good faith application of its law.
Article 8.15: Denial of Benefits16

A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of that other Party and to investments of that investor if the enterprise:

is owned or controlled by a person of a non-Party or of the denying Party; and

has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party.

A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of that other Party and to investments of that investor if persons of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and the denying Party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party or a person of the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise or to its investments.
Article 8.16: Investment and Environmental, Health and other Regulatory Objectives

Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental, health or other regulatory objectives.

Article 8.17: Corporate Social Responsibility

Each Party encourages enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate into their internal policies those internationally recognised standards, guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility that have been endorsed or are supported by that Party.

Article 8.18: General Exceptions

Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between investments or between investors, or a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures:

necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;

necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter;

imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value; or

relating to the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.

The Parties understand that the measures referred to in subparagraph 1(a) include environmental measures to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and that the measures referred to in subparagraph 1(d) include environmental measures relating to the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.
Section B: Investor-State Dispute Settlement 17

Article 8.19: Consultation and Negotiation

In the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the respondent should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third party procedures, such as good offices, conciliation or mediation.

The claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written request for consultations setting out a brief description of facts regarding the measure or measures at issue.

For greater certainty, the initiation of consultations and negotiations shall not be construed as recognition of the jurisdiction of the tribunal.
Article 8.20: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

If an investment dispute has not been resolved within six months of the receipt by the respondent of a written request for consultations pursuant to Article 8.19.2:

the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim:

that the respondent has breached an obligation under Section A; and

that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and

the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim:

that the respondent has breached an obligation under Section A; and

that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach,

No claim may be brought under this Section in relation to an investment which has been established through illegal conduct, including fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment or corruption. For greater certainty, this exclusion does not apply to investments established through minor or technical breaches of law.

At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, the claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit a claim to arbitration (notice of intent). The notice shall specify:

the name and address of the claimant and, if a claim is submitted on behalf of an enterprise, the name, address and place of incorporation of the enterprise;

for each claim, the provision of this Agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;

the legal and factual basis for each claim; and

the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed.

The claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1 under one of the following alternatives:

the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the non-disputing Party are parties to the ICSID Convention;

the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the respondent or the non-disputing Party is a party to the ICSID Convention;

the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or

if the claimant and respondent agree, any other arbitral institution or any other arbitration rules.

A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when the claimant’s notice of or request for arbitration (notice of arbitration):

referred to in the ICSID Convention is received by the Secretary-General;

referred to in the ICSID Additional Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General;

referred to in the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to therein, are received by the respondent; or

referred to under any arbitral institution or arbitration rules selected under paragraph 4(d) is received by the respondent.

A claim asserted by the claimant for the first time after such notice of arbitration is submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the applicable arbitration rules.

The arbitration rules applicable under paragraph 4 that are in effect on the date the claim or claims were submitted to arbitration under this Section shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Agreement.

The claimant shall provide with the notice of arbitration:

the name of the arbitrator that the claimant appoints; or

the claimant’s written consent for the Secretary-General to appoint that arbitrator.
Article 8.21: Consent of Each Party to Arbitration

Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section in accordance with this Agreement.

The consent under paragraph 1 and the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of:

Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties to the dispute; and

Article II of the New York Convention for an “agreement in writing”.
Article 8.22: Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party

No claim shall be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years and six months have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 8.20.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 8.20.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 8.20.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.

No claim shall be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:

the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and

the notice of arbitration is accompanied:

for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 8.20.1(a), by the claimant’s written waiver; and

for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 8.20.1(b), by the claimant’s and the enterprise’s written waivers,

of any right to initiate or continue before any court or administrative tribunal under the law of a Party, or any other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 8.20.

Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b), the claimant (for claims brought under Article 8.20.1(a)) and the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 8.20.1(b)) may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief and does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of preserving the claimant’s or the enterprise’s rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.
Article 8.23: Selection of Arbitrators

Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third, who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the disputing parties.

The Secretary-General shall serve as appointing authority for an arbitration under this Section.

If a tribunal has not been constituted within a period of 90 days after the date that a claim is submitted to arbitration under this Section, the Secretary-General, on the request of a disputing party, shall appoint, in his or her discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. The Secretary-General shall not appoint a national of either Party as the presiding arbitrator unless the disputing parties agree otherwise.

For the purposes of Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and Article 7 of Schedule C to the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and without prejudice to an objection to an arbitrator on a ground other than nationality:

the respondent agrees to the appointment of each individual member of a tribunal established under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules;

a claimant referred to in Article 8.20.1(a) may submit a claim to arbitration under this Section, or continue a claim, under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, only on condition that the claimant agrees in writing to the appointment of each individual member of the tribunal; and

a claimant referred to in Article 8.20.1(b) may submit a claim to arbitration under this Section, or continue a claim, under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, only on condition that the claimant and the enterprise agree in writing to the appointment of each individual member of the tribunal.

The Parties shall, prior to the entry into force of this Agreement, provide guidance on the application of the Code of Conduct for Dispute Settlement Proceedings under Chapter 27 (Dispute Settlement) to arbitrators selected to serve on investor-State dispute settlement tribunals pursuant to this Article, including any necessary modifications to the Code of Conduct to conform to the context of investor-State dispute settlement. The Parties shall also provide guidance on the application of other relevant rules or guidelines on conflicts of interest in international arbitration. Arbitrators shall comply with that guidance in addition to the applicable arbitral rules regarding independence and impartiality of arbitrators.
Article 8.24: Conduct of the Arbitration

The disputing parties may agree on the legal place of any arbitration under the arbitration rules applicable under Article 8.20.4. If the disputing parties fail to reach agreement, the tribunal shall determine the place in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, provided that the place shall be in the territory of a State that is a party to the New York Convention.

The non-disputing Party may make oral and written submissions to the tribunal regarding the interpretation of this Agreement.

After consultation with the disputing parties, the tribunal may accept and consider written amicus curiae submissions regarding a matter of fact or law within the scope of the dispute that may assist the tribunal in evaluating the submissions and arguments of the disputing parties from a person or entity that is not a disputing party but has a significant interest in the arbitral proceedings. Each submission shall identify the author; disclose any affiliation, direct or indirect, with any disputing party; and identify any person, government or other entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission. Each submission shall be in a language of the arbitration and comply with any page limits and deadlines set by the tribunal. The tribunal shall provide the disputing parties with an opportunity to respond to such submissions. The tribunal shall ensure that the submissions do not disrupt or unduly burden the arbitral proceedings, or unfairly prejudice any disputing party.

Without prejudice to a tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the competence of the tribunal, including an objection to the tribunal’s jurisdiction, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 8.30 or that a claim is manifestly without legal merit:

an objection under this paragraph shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment;

on receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor;

in deciding an objection under this paragraph that a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 8.30, the tribunal shall assume to be true the claimant’s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in the relevant article of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute; and

the respondent does not waive any objection as to competence, including an objection to jurisdiction, or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.

In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 or any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence, including an objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s jurisdiction. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.

When the tribunal decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, it may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.

For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party submits a claim under this Section, including a claim alleging that a Party breached Article 8.6, the investor has the burden of proving all elements of its claims, consistent with general principles of international law applicable to international arbitration.

A respondent may not assert as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off or for any other reason, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract.

A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 8.20. For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.

In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties. Within 60 days after the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its proposed decision or award. The tribunal shall consider any comments and issue its decision or award no later than 45 days after the expiration of the 60 day comment period.

In the event that an appellate mechanism for reviewing awards rendered by investor-State dispute settlement tribunals is developed in the future under other institutional arrangements, the Parties shall consider whether awards rendered under Article 8.30 should be subject to that appellate mechanism. The Parties shall strive to ensure that any such appellate mechanism they consider adopting provides for transparency of proceedings similar to the transparency provisions established in Article 8.25.
Article 8.25: Transparency of Arbitral Proceedings

Subject to paragraphs 2 and 4, the respondent shall, after receiving the following documents, promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Party and make them available to the public:

the notice of intent;

the notice of arbitration;

pleadings, memorials and briefs submitted to the tribunal by a disputing party and any written submissions submitted pursuant to Article 8.24.2, Article 8.24.3 and Article 8.29;

minutes or transcripts of hearings of the tribunal, if available; and

orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal.

The tribunal shall conduct hearings open to the public and shall determine, in consultation with the disputing parties, the appropriate logistical arrangements. If a disputing party intends to use information in a hearing that is designated as protected information or otherwise subject to paragraph 3 it shall so advise the tribunal. The tribunal shall make appropriate arrangements to protect such information from disclosure which may include closing the hearing for the duration of the discussion of that information.

Nothing in this Section, including paragraph 4(d), requires a respondent to make available to the public or otherwise disclose during or after the arbitral proceedings, including the hearing, protected information, or to furnish or allow access to information that it may withhold in accordance with Article 28.2 (Security Exceptions) or Article 28.5 (Disclosure of Information). 18

Any protected information that is submitted to the tribunal shall be protected from disclosure in accordance with the following procedures:

subject to subparagraph (d), neither the disputing parties nor the tribunal shall disclose to the non-disputing Party or to the public any protected information if the disputing party that provided the information clearly designates it in accordance with subparagraph (b);

any disputing party claiming that certain information constitutes protected information shall clearly designate the information according to any schedule set by the tribunal;

a disputing party shall, according to any schedule set by the tribunal, submit a redacted version of the document that does not contain the protected information. Only the redacted version shall be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 1; and

the tribunal, subject to paragraph 3, shall decide any objection regarding the designation of information claimed to be protected information. If the tribunal determines that the information was not properly designated, the disputing party that submitted the information may:

withdraw all or part of its submission containing that information; or

agree to resubmit complete and redacted documents with corrected designations in accordance with the tribunal’s determination and subparagraph (c); and

in either case, the other disputing party shall, whenever necessary, resubmit complete and redacted documents which either remove the information withdrawn under subparagraph (d)(i) by the disputing party that first submitted the information or redesignate the information consistent with the designation under subparagraph (d)(ii) of the disputing party that first submitted the information.

Nothing in this Section requires a respondent to withhold from the public information required to be disclosed by its laws or regulations. The respondent should endeavour to apply those laws and regulations in a manner sensitive to protecting from disclosure information that has been designated as protected information.
Article 8.26: Governing Law

Subject to paragraph 2, when a claim is submitted under Article 8.20.1(a)(i) or Article 8.20.1(b)(i), the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law. 19

A decision of the Joint Commission on the interpretation of a provision of this Agreement under Article 26.2.2(f) (Functions of the Joint Commission) shall be binding on a tribunal, and any decision or award issued by a tribunal must be consistent with that decision.
Article 8.27: Interpretation of Annexes

If a respondent asserts as a defence that the measure alleged to be a breach is within the scope of a non-conforming measure set out in Annex I or Annex II, the tribunal shall, on request of the respondent, request the interpretation of the Joint Commission on the issue. The Joint Commission shall submit in writing any decision on its interpretation under Article 26.2.2(f) (Functions of the Joint Commission) to the tribunal within 90 days of delivery of the request.

A decision issued by the Joint Commission under paragraph 1 shall be binding on the tribunal, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that decision. If the Joint Commission fails to issue such a decision within 90 days, the tribunal shall decide the issue.
Article 8.28: Expert Reports

Without prejudice to the appointment of other kinds of experts when authorised by the applicable arbitration rules, a tribunal, on request of a disputing party or, unless the disputing parties disapprove, on its own initiative, may appoint one or more experts to report to it in writing on any factual issue concerning scientific matters raised by a disputing party in a proceeding, subject to any terms and conditions that the disputing parties may agree.

Article 8.29: Consolidation

If two or more claims have been submitted separately to arbitration under Article 8.20.1 and the claims have a question of law or fact in common and arise out of the same events or circumstances, any disputing party may seek a consolidation order in accordance with the agreement of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order or the terms of paragraphs 2 through 10.

A disputing party that seeks a consolidation order under this Article shall deliver, in writing, a request to the Secretary-General and to all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order and shall specify in the request:

the names and addresses of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order;

the nature of the order sought; and

the grounds on which the order is sought.

Unless the Secretary-General finds within a period of 30 days after the date of receiving a request under paragraph 2 that the request is manifestly unfounded, a tribunal shall be established under this Article.

Unless all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order agree otherwise, a tribunal established under this Article shall comprise three arbitrators:

one arbitrator appointed by agreement of the claimants;

one arbitrator appointed by the respondent; and

the presiding arbitrator appointed by the Secretary-General, provided that the presiding arbitrator is not a national of the respondent or of a Party of any claimant.

If, within a period of 60 days after the date when the Secretary-General receives a request made under paragraph 2, the respondent fails or the claimants fail to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with paragraph 4, the Secretary-General, on request of any disputing party sought to be covered by the order, shall appoint, in his or her discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed.

If a tribunal established under this Article is satisfied that two or more claims that have been submitted to arbitration under Article 8.20.1 have a question of law or fact in common, and arise out of the same events or circumstances, the tribunal may, in the interest of fair and efficient resolution of the claims, and after hearing the disputing parties, by order:

assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims;

assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more of the claims, the determination of which it believes would assist in the resolution of the others; or

instruct a tribunal previously established under Article 8.23 to assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims, provided that:

that tribunal, on request of a claimant that was not previously a disputing party before that tribunal, shall be reconstituted with its original members, except that the arbitrator for the claimants shall be appointed pursuant to paragraphs 4(a) and 5; and

that tribunal shall decide whether a prior hearing shall be repeated.

If a tribunal has been established under this Article, a claimant that has submitted a claim to arbitration under Article 8.20.1 and that has not been named in a request made under paragraph 2 may make a written request to the tribunal that it be included in any order made under paragraph 6. The request shall specify:

the name and address of the claimant;

the nature of the order sought; and

the grounds on which the order is sought,

and the claimant shall deliver a copy of its request to the Secretary-General.

A tribunal established under this Article shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this Section.

A tribunal established under Article 8.23 shall not have jurisdiction to decide a claim, or a part of a claim, over which a tribunal established or instructed under this Article has assumed jurisdiction.

On the application of a disputing party, a tribunal established under this Article, pending its decision under paragraph 6, may order that the proceedings of a tribunal established under Article 8.23 be stayed, unless the latter tribunal has already adjourned its proceedings.
Article 8.30: Awards

When a tribunal makes a final award, the tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:

monetary damages and any applicable interest; and

restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.

For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party submits a claim to arbitration under Article 8.20.1(a), it may recover only for loss or damage that it has incurred in its capacity as an investor of a Party.

A tribunal may also award costs and attorney’s fees incurred by the disputing parties in connection with the arbitral proceeding, and shall determine how and by whom those costs and attorney’s fees shall be paid, in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.

For greater certainty, for claims alleging the breach of an obligation under Section A with respect to an attempt to make an investment, when an award is made in favour of the claimant, the only damages that may be awarded are those that the claimant has proven were sustained in the attempt to make the investment, provided that the claimant also proves that the breach was the proximate cause of those damages. If the tribunal determines such claims to be frivolous, the tribunal may award to the respondent reasonable costs and attorney’s fees.

Subject to paragraph 1, if a claim is submitted to arbitration under Article 8.20.1(b) and an award is made in favour of the enterprise:

an award of restitution of property shall provide that restitution be made to the enterprise;

an award of monetary damages and any applicable interest shall provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise; and

the award shall provide that it is made without prejudice to any right that any person may have under applicable domestic law with respect to the relief provided in the award.

A tribunal shall not award punitive damages.

An award made by a tribunal shall have no binding force except between the disputing parties and in respect of the particular case.

Subject to paragraph 9 and the applicable review procedure for an interim award, a disputing party shall abide by and comply with an award without delay.

A disputing party shall not seek enforcement of a final award until:

in the case of a final award made under the ICSID Convention:

120 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has requested revision or annulment of the award; or

revision or annulment proceedings have been completed; and

in the case of a final award under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, or the rules selected pursuant to Article 8.20.4(d):

90 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has commenced a proceeding to revise, set aside or annul the award; or

a court has dismissed or allowed an application to revise, set aside or annul the award and there is no further appeal.

Each Party shall provide for the enforcement of an award in its territory.

If the respondent fails to abide by or comply with a final award, on delivery of a request by the non-disputing Party, a panel shall be established under Article 27.7 (Establishment of a Panel). The requesting Party may seek in those proceedings:

a determination that the failure to abide by or comply with the final award is inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement; and

in accordance with Article 27.15 (Initial Report), a recommendation that the respondent abide by or comply with the final award.

A disputing party may seek enforcement of an arbitration award under the ICSID Convention or the New York Convention regardless of whether proceedings have been taken under paragraph 11.

A claim that is submitted to arbitration under this Section shall be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for the purposes of Article I of the New York Convention.
Article 8.31: Service of Documents

Delivery of notice and other documents to a Party shall be made to the place named for that Party in Annex 8-C. A Party shall promptly make publicly available and notify the other Party of any change to the place referred to in that Annex.

ANNEX 8-A

CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that “customary international law” generally and as specifically referenced in Article 8.6 results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. The customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the investments of aliens.

ANNEX 8-B

EXPROPRIATION

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:
An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.

Article 8.8.1 addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, in which an investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.

The second situation addressed by Article 8.8.1 is indirect expropriation, in which an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.

The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:

the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;

the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; 20 and

the character of the government action.

Non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health,21 safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations, except in rare circumstances.
ANNEX 8-C

ANNEX 8-D

FOREIGN INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK

A decision under Australia’s Foreign Investment Framework, which comprises Australia’s Foreign Investment Policy; Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth); Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulation 2015 (Cth); Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Act 2015 (Cth); Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Regulation 2015 (Cth); Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 (Cth); and Ministerial Statements, shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions under Section B or Chapter 27 (Dispute Settlement).

ANNEX 8-E

PUBLIC DEBT

The Parties recognise that the purchase of debt issued by a Party entails commercial risk. For greater certainty, no award shall be made in favour of a claimant for a claim under Article 8.20.1(a)(i) or Article 8.20.1(b)(i) with respect to default or non-payment of debt issued by a Party unless the claimant meets its burden of proving that such default or non-payment constitutes a breach of an obligation under Section A, including an uncompensated expropriation pursuant to Article 8.8.

No claim that a restructuring of debt issued by a Party breaches an obligation under Section A shall be submitted to, or if already submitted continue in, arbitration under Section B if the restructuring is a negotiated restructuring at the time of submission, or becomes a negotiated restructuring after that submission, except for a claim that the restructuring violates Article 8.4 or Article 8.5.

Notwithstanding Article 8.20.4, and subject to paragraph 2, an investor of the other Party shall not submit a claim under Section B that a restructuring of debt issued by a Party breaches an obligation under Section A, other than Article 8.4 or Article 8.5, unless 270 days have elapsed from the date of receipt by the respondent of the written request for consultations pursuant to Article 8.19.2.
ANNEX 8-F

SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM TO ARBITRATION

An investor of a Party may not submit to arbitration under Section B a claim that Peru has breached an obligation under Section A either:

on its own behalf under Article 8.20.1(a); or

on behalf of an enterprise of Peru that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly under 8.20.1(b),

if the investor or the enterprise, respectively, has alleged that breach of an obligation under Section A in proceedings before a court or administrative tribunal of Peru.

For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party elects to submit a claim of the type described in paragraph 1 to a court or administrative tribunal of Peru, that election shall be definitive and exclusive, and the investor may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.

the access to and use of distribution, transport or telecommunications networks and services in connection with the supply of a service;

the presence in the Party’s territory of a service supplier of the other Party; and

the provision of a bond or other form of financial security as a condition for the supply of a service.

In addition to paragraph 1, Article 9.5, Article 9.8 and Article 9.11 shall also apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party affecting the supply of a service in its territory by a covered investment1.

This Chapter shall not apply to:

This Chapter shall not apply to air services, including domestic and international air transportation services, whether scheduled or non-scheduled, or to related services in support of air services, other than the following:

aircraft repair and maintenance services during which an aircraft is withdrawn from service, excluding so-called line maintenance;

selling and marketing of air transport services;

computer reservation system services;

In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and a bilateral, plurilateral or multilateral air services agreement to which both Parties are party, the air services agreement shall prevail in determining the rights and obligations of the Parties.

If the Parties have the same obligations under this Agreement and a bilateral, plurilateral or multilateral air services agreement, they may invoke the dispute settlement procedures of this Agreement only after any dispute settlement procedures in the other agreement have been exhausted.

If the Annex on Air Transport Services of GATS is amended, the Parties shall jointly review any new definitions with a view to aligning the definitions in this Agreement with those definitions, as appropriate.
Article 9.3: National Treatment2

Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party, treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own services and service suppliers.

For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraph 1 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to service suppliers of the Party of which it forms a part.
Article 9.4: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment

Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to services and service suppliers of a non-Party.

Article 9.5: Market Access

Neither Party shall adopt or maintain, either on the basis of a regional subdivision or on the basis of its entire territory, measures that:
impose limitations on:

the number of service suppliers, whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirement of an economic needs test;

the total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test;

the total number of service operations or the total quantity of service output expressed in terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test;3 or

restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier may supply a service.
Article 9.6: Local Presence

Neither Party shall require a service supplier of the other Party to establish or maintain a representative office or any form of enterprise, or to be resident, in its territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service.
Article 9.7: Non-Conforming Measures

Article 9.3, Article 9.4, Article 9.5 and Article 9.6 shall not apply to:

any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party at:

the central level of government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I;

a regional level of government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I; or

a local level of government;

the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); or

an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a), to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with Article 9.3, Article 9.4, Article 9.5 or Article 9.6.

Article 9.3, Article 9.4, Article 9.5 and Article 9.6 shall not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, sub-sectors or activities, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex II.

If a Party considers that a non-conforming measure applied by a regional level of government of the other Party, as referred to in subparagraph 1(a)(ii), creates a material impediment to the cross-border supply of services in relation to the former Party, it may request consultations with regard to that measure. The Parties shall enter into consultations with a view to exchanging information on the operation of the measure and to considering whether further steps are necessary and appropriate.4
Article 9.8: Domestic Regulation

Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.

With a view to ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, while recognising the right to regulate and to introduce new regulations on the supply of services in order to meet its policy objectives, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that any such measures that it adopts or maintains are:

based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to supply the service;

not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service; and

in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of the service.

In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations under paragraph 2, account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations applied by that Party.5

If a Party requires authorisation for the supply of a service, it shall ensure that its competent authorities:

within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under its laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application;

to the extent practicable, establish an indicative timeframe for the processing of an application;

if an application is rejected, to the extent practicable, inform the applicant of the reasons for the rejection, either directly or on request, as appropriate;

on request of the applicant, provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application;

to the extent practicable, provide the applicant with the opportunity to correct minor errors and omissions in the application and endeavour to provide guidance on the additional information required;

if they deem appropriate, accept copies of documents that are authenticated in accordance with the Party’s laws in place of original documents;

reach and administer its decisions in an independent manner and that the procedures are impartial;

avoid requiring an applicant to approach more than one competent authority for each application for authorisation; and

taking into account their competing priorities and resource constraints, endeavour to accept applications in electronic format.

Each Party shall ensure that any authorisation fee charged by any of its competent authorities is reasonable, transparent and does not, in itself, restrict the supply of the relevant service.6

The Party shall make publicly available the information necessary for service suppliers to comply with the requirements and procedures for obtaining, maintaining, amending and renewing such authorisation. Such information shall include, inter alia, where it exists:

fees;

contact information of relevant competent authorities;

procedures for appeal or review of decisions concerning applications;

procedures for monitoring or enforcing compliance with the terms and conditions of licenses;

opportunities for public involvement, such as through hearings or comments;

indicative timeframes for processing of an application;

the requirements and procedures; and

technical standards.

If licensing or qualification requirements include the completion of an examination, each Party shall ensure that:

the examination is scheduled at reasonable intervals; and

a reasonable period of time is provided to enable interested persons to submit an application.

Each Party shall ensure that there are procedures in place domestically to assess the competency of professionals of the other Party.

Paragraphs 1 through 8 shall not apply to the non-conforming aspects of measures that are not subject to the obligations under Article 9.3 or Article 9.5 by reason of an entry in either Party’s Schedule to Annex I, or to measures that are not subject to the obligations under Article 9.3 or Article 9.5 by reason of an entry in either Party’s Schedule to Annex II.

If the results of the negotiations related to paragraph 4 of Article VI of GATS, or the results of any similar negotiations undertaken in other multilateral fora in which the Parties participate, enter into effect, the Parties shall jointly review these results with a view to bringing them into effect, as appropriate, under this Agreement.
Article 9.9: Recognition

For the purposes of the fulfilment, in whole or in part, of a Party’s standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, and subject to the requirements of paragraph 4, it may recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of the other Party or a non-Party. That recognition, which may be achieved through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based on an agreement or arrangement with the Party or non-Party concerned, or may be accorded autonomously.

If a Party recognises, autonomously or by agreement or arrangement, the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of a non-Party, nothing in Article 9.4 shall be construed to require the Party to accord recognition to the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of the other Party.

A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in paragraph 1, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate opportunity to the other Party, on request, to negotiate its accession to that agreement or arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement. If a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity to the other Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licences or certifications obtained or requirements met in that Party’s territory should be recognised.

A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner that would constitute a means of discrimination between the Parties or between a Party and non-Parties in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.

As set out in Annex 9-A, the Parties shall endeavour to facilitate trade in professional services, including through the establishment of a Professional Services Working Group.
Article 9.10: Denial of Benefits

A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of the other Party if the service supplier is an enterprise owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party, and the denying Party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party or a person of the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise.

A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of the other Party if the service supplier is an enterprise owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party or by persons of the denying Party that has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party.
Article 9.11: Transparency

Each Party shall maintain or establish appropriate mechanisms for responding to inquiries from interested persons regarding its regulations that relate to the subject matter of this Chapter.7

If a Party does not provide advance notice and opportunity for comment pursuant to Article 25.2.2 (Publication) with respect to regulations that relate to the subject matter in this Chapter, it shall, to the extent practicable, provide in writing or otherwise notify interested persons of the reasons for not doing so.

To the extent possible, each Party shall allow reasonable time between publication of final regulations and the date when they enter into effect.
Article 9.12: Payments and Transfers

Each Party shall permit all transfers and payments that relate to the cross-border supply of services to be made freely and without delay into and out of its territory.

Each Party shall permit transfers and payments that relate to the cross-border supply of services to be made in a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange that prevails at the time of transfer.

Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent or delay a transfer or payment through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws and regulations8 that relate to:

bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors;

issuing, trading or dealing in securities, futures, options or derivatives;

financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities;

criminal or penal offences; or

ensuring compliance with orders or judgments in judicial or administrative proceedings.
ANNEX 9-A

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

General Provisions

Each Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to establish or maintain dialogues with the relevant bodies of the other Party with the aim of facilitating the supply of professional services between the Parties through greater recognition of education or experience obtained in the territory of the other Party. This includes encouraging relevant professional bodies to engage in cooperation with a view to formalising recognition of licensing, registration and professional standards.

Each Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to take into account agreements that relate to professional services in the development of agreements on the recognition of professional qualifications, licensing and registration.

A Party may consider, if feasible, taking steps to implement a temporary or project specific licensing or registration regime based on a foreign supplier’s home licence or recognised professional body membership, without the need for further written examination. That temporary or limited licence regime should not operate to prevent a foreign supplier from gaining a local licence once that supplier satisfies the applicable local licensing requirements.
Engineering and Architectural Services


Further to paragraph 2, the Parties recognise the work in APEC to promote the mutual recognition of professional competence in engineering and architecture, and the professional mobility of these professions, under the APEC Engineer and APEC Architect frameworks.

Each Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to work towards becoming authorised to operate APEC Engineer and APEC Architect Registers.

A Party shall encourage its relevant bodies operating APEC Engineer or APEC Architect Registers to enter into mutual recognition arrangements with the relevant bodies of the other Party operating those registers.
Legal Services

The Parties recognise that transnational legal services that cover the laws of multiple jurisdictions play an essential role in facilitating trade and investment and in promoting economic growth and business confidence.

If a Party regulates or seeks to regulate foreign lawyers and transnational legal practice, the Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to consider, subject to its laws and regulations, whether or in what manner:

foreign lawyers may practise foreign law on the basis of their right to practise that law in their home jurisdiction;

foreign lawyers may prepare for and appear in commercial arbitration, conciliation and mediation proceedings;

local ethical, conduct and disciplinary standards are applied to foreign lawyers in a manner that is no more burdensome for foreign lawyers than the requirements imposed on domestic (host country) lawyers;

alternatives for minimum residency requirements are provided for foreign lawyers, such as requirements that foreign lawyers disclose to clients their status as a foreign lawyer, or maintain professional indemnity insurance or alternatively disclose to clients that they lack that insurance;

the following modes of providing transnational legal services are accommodated:

on a temporary fly-in, fly-out basis;

through the use of web-based or telecommunications technology;

by establishing a commercial presence; and

through a combination of fly-in, fly-out and one or both of the other modes listed in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii);

foreign lawyers and domestic (host country) lawyers may work together in the delivery of fully integrated transnational legal services; and

a foreign law firm may use the firm name of its choice.
Professional Services Working Group

The Parties hereby establish a Professional Services Working Group, which shall:

meet on request of the Joint Commission to ensure the observance of and discuss progress towards the objectives in paragraphs 1 through 3; and

support the Parties’ relevant professional and regulatory bodies in pursuing the activities listed in paragraphs 1 through 3.

Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of the other Party, and to investments of investors of the other Party in financial institutions, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own financial institutions, and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.

For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, financial institutions and investments of investors in financial institutions, of the Party of which it forms a part.

For the purposes of the national treatment obligations in Article 10.6.1 (Cross-Border Trade), a Party shall accord to cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own financial service suppliers, in like circumstances, with respect to the supply of the relevant service.

Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party located in the territory of the other Party.

If a Party requires a financial institution to obtain authorisation to supply a new financial service, the Party shall decide within a reasonable period of time whether to issue the authorisation and may refuse the authorisation only for prudential reasons.

Article 10.8: Treatment of Certain Information

Nothing in this Chapter shall require a Party to furnish or allow access to:
information related to the financial affairs and accounts of individual customers of financial institutions or cross-border financial service suppliers; or

any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party at:

the central level of government, as set out in Section A of its Schedule to Annex III;

a regional level of government, as set out in Section A of its Schedule to Annex III; or

a local level of government;

the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); or

an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure as it existed:

immediately before the amendment, with Article 10.3, Article 10.4, Article 10.5 or Article 10.9; or

Article 10.3 shall not apply to any measure that falls within an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by:

Article 17.8 (National Treatment); or

Article 3 of the TRIPS Agreement, if the exception or derogation relates to matters not addressed by Chapter 17 (Intellectual Property).

Article 10.4 shall not apply to any measure that falls within Article 5 of the TRIPS Agreement, or an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by:

Article 17.8 (National Treatment); or

Article 4 of the TRIPS Agreement.
Article 10.11: Exceptions

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter and Agreement except for Chapter 2 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods), Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures), Chapter 4 (Customs Administration and Trade Facilitation), Chapter 5 (Trade Remedies), Chapter 6 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) and Chapter 7 (Technical Barriers to Trade), a Party shall not be prevented from adopting or maintaining measures for prudential reasons,7 including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial institution or cross-border financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. If these measures do not conform with the provisions of this Agreement to which this exception applies, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party’s commitments or obligations under those provisions.

Nothing in this Chapter, Chapter 8 (Investment), Chapter 9 (Cross-Border Trade in Services), Chapter 12 (Telecommunications) including specifically Article 12.23 (Relation to Other Chapters), or Chapter 13 (Electronic Commerce), shall apply to non-discriminatory measures of general application taken by any public entity in pursuit of monetary and related credit policies or exchange rate policies. This paragraph shall not affect a Party’s obligations under Article 8.10 (Performance Requirements) with respect to measures covered by Chapter 8 (Investment), under Article 8.9 (Transfers) or Article 9.12 (Payments and Transfers).

Notwithstanding Article 8.9 (Transfers) and Article 9.12 (Payments and Transfers), as incorporated into this Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution or cross-border financial service supplier to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution or supplier, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity, or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service suppliers. This paragraph does not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to restrict transfers.

For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter, including those relating to the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on financial services contracts, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties or between the Parties and non-Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment in financial institutions or cross-border trade in financial services as covered by this Chapter.
Article 10.12: Recognition

A Party may recognise prudential measures of a non-Party in the application of measures covered by this Chapter. 8 That recognition may be:

accorded autonomously;

achieved through harmonisation or other means; or

based upon an agreement or arrangement with the non-Party.

A Party that accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 1 shall provide adequate opportunity to the other Party to demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of regulation and, if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the Parties.

If a Party accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 1(c) and the circumstances set out in paragraph 2 exist, that Party shall provide adequate opportunity to the other Party to negotiate accession to the agreement or arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement.
Article 10.13: Transparency and Administration of Certain Measures

The Parties recognise that transparent regulations and policies governing the activities of financial institutions and cross-border financial service suppliers are important in facilitating their ability to gain access to and operate in each other’s markets. Each Party commits to promote regulatory transparency in financial services.

Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application to which this Chapter applies are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.

Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 25.2 (Publication), shall not apply to regulations of general application relating to the subject matter of this Chapter. Each Party shall, to the extent practicable:

publish in advance any such regulation that it proposes to adopt and the purpose of the regulation; and

provide interested persons and the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to comment on that proposed regulation.

At the time that it adopts a final regulation, a Party shall, to the extent practicable, address in writing the substantive comments received from interested persons with respect to the proposed regulation.9

To the extent practicable, each Party shall allow a reasonable period of time between publication of a final regulation of general application and the date when it enters into effect.

Each Party shall ensure that the rules of general application adopted or maintained by a self-regulatory organisation of the Party are promptly published or otherwise made available in a manner that enables interested persons to become acquainted with them.

Each Party shall maintain or establish appropriate mechanisms for responding to inquiries from interested persons regarding measures of general application covered by this Chapter.

Each Party’s regulatory authorities shall make publicly available the requirements, including any documentation required, for completing an application relating to the supply of financial services.

On request of an applicant, a Party’s regulatory authority shall inform the applicant of the status of its application. If the authority requires additional information from the applicant, it shall notify the applicant without undue delay.

A Party’s regulatory authority shall make an administrative decision on a complete application of an investor in a financial institution, a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier of the other Party relating to the supply of a financial service, within 120 days and shall promptly notify the applicant of the decision. An application shall not be considered complete until all relevant hearings have been held and all necessary information has been received. If it is not practicable for a decision to be made within 120 days, the regulatory authority shall notify the applicant without undue delay and shall endeavour to make the decision within a reasonable period of time thereafter.

On request of an unsuccessful applicant, a regulatory authority that has denied an application shall, to the extent practicable, inform the applicant of the reasons for denial of the application.
Article 10.14: Self-Regulatory Organisations

If a Party requires a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier of the other Party to be a member of, participate in, or have access to, a self-regulatory organisation in order to provide a financial service in or into its territory, it shall ensure that the self-regulatory organisation observes the obligations contained in Article 10.3 and Article 10.4.

Article 10.15: Payment and Clearing Systems

Under terms and conditions that accord national treatment, each Party shall grant financial institutions of the other Party established in its territory access to payment and clearing systems operated by public entities, and to official funding and refinancing facilities available in the normal course of ordinary business. This Article is not intended to confer access to the Party’s lender of last resort facilities.

Article 10.16: Expedited Availability of Insurance Services

The Parties recognise the importance of maintaining and developing regulatory procedures to expedite the offering of insurance services by licensed suppliers. These procedures may include: allowing introduction of products unless those products are disapproved within a reasonable period of time; not requiring product approval or authorisation of insurance lines for insurance other than insurance sold to individuals or compulsory insurance; or not imposing limitations on the number or frequency of product introductions. If a Party maintains regulatory product approval procedures, that Party shall endeavour to maintain or improve those procedures.

Article 10.17: Performance of Back-Office Functions

The Parties recognise that the performance of the back-office functions of a financial institution in its territory by the head office or an affiliate of the financial institution, or by an unrelated service supplier, either inside or outside its territory, is important to the effective management and efficient operation of that financial institution. While a Party may require financial institutions to ensure compliance with any domestic requirements applicable to those functions, they recognise the importance of avoiding the imposition of arbitrary requirements on the performance of those functions.

For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 prevents a Party from requiring a financial institution in its territory to retain certain functions.
Article 10.18: Consultations

A Party may request, in writing, consultations with the other Party regarding any matter arising under this Agreement that affects financial services. The other Party shall give sympathetic consideration to the request to hold consultations.

With regard to matters relating to existing non-conforming measures maintained by a Party at a regional level of government as referred to in Article 10.10.1(a)(ii):

a Party may request information on any non-conforming measure at the regional level of government of the other Party. Each Party shall establish a contact point to respond to those requests and to facilitate the exchange of information regarding the operation of measures covered by those requests.

if a Party considers that a non-conforming measure applied by a regional level of government of the other Party creates a material impediment to trade or investment by a financial institution, an investor, investments in a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier, the Party may request consultations with regard to that measure. The Parties shall enter into consultations with a view to exchanging information on the operation of the measure and to considering whether further steps are necessary and appropriate.

Consultations under this Article shall include officials of the authorities specified in Annex 10-B.

For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be construed to require a Party to derogate from its law regarding sharing of information between financial regulators or the requirements of an agreement or arrangement between financial authorities of the Parties, or to require a regulatory authority to take any action that would interfere with specific regulatory, supervisory, administrative or enforcement matters.
Article 10.19: Dispute Settlement

Chapter 27 (Dispute Settlement) shall apply as modified by this Article to the settlement of disputes arising under this Chapter.

If a Party claims that a dispute arises under this Chapter, Article 27.9 (Composition of Panels) shall apply, except that:

if the Parties agree, each panellist shall meet the qualifications in paragraph 3; and

in any other case:

each Party shall select panellists that meet the qualifications set out in either paragraph 3 or Article 27.10.1 (Qualifications of Panellists); and

if the responding Party invokes Article 10.11, the chair of the panel shall meet the qualifications set out in paragraph 3, unless the Parties otherwise agree.

In addition to the requirements set out in Article 27.10.1(b) to (d) (Qualifications of Panellists), panellists in disputes arising under this Chapter shall have expertise or experience in financial services law or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions.

If a Party seeks to suspend benefits in the financial services sector, a panel that reconvenes to make a determination on the proposed suspension of benefits, in accordance with Article 27.18.5 (Non-Implementation – Compensation and Suspension of Benefits), shall seek the views of financial services experts, as necessary.
Article 10.20: Portfolio Management

A Party shall allow a financial institution organised in the territory of the other Party to provide the following services to a collective investment scheme located in its territory10:

investment advice; and

portfolio management services, excluding:

trustee services; and

custodial services and execution services that are not related to managing a collective investment scheme.

Paragraph 1 is subject to Article 10.6.3.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, collective investment scheme means:

For Australia, a “managed investment scheme” as defined under section 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), other than a managed investment scheme operated in contravention of subsection 601ED (5) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), or an entity that:

carries on a business of investment in securities, interests in land, or other investments; and

in the course of carrying on that business, invests funds subscribed, whether directly or indirectly, after an offer or invitation to the public (within the meaning of section 82 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)) made on terms that the funds subscribed would be invested;

For Peru:

mutual funds for investments and securities, pursuant to Legislative Decree Nº 861 (Texto Único Ordenado de la Ley de Mercado de Valores aprobado mediante Decreto Supremo Nº 093-2002-EF); or

investment funds, pursuant to Legislative Decree Nº 862 (Decreto Legislativo Nº 862, Ley de Fondos de Inversión y sus Sociedades Administradoras).
Article 10.21: Transfer of Information

Each Party shall allow a financial institution of the other Party to transfer information in electronic or other form, into and out of its territory, for data processing if such processing is required in the institution’s ordinary course of business. Nothing in this Chapter restricts the right of a Party to adopt or maintain measures to:
protect personal data, personal privacy and the confidentiality of individual records and accounts; or

require a financial institution to obtain prior authorisation from the relevant regulator to designate a particular enterprise as a recipient of such information, based on prudential considerations, 11
provided that this right is not used as a means of avoiding the Party’s commitments or obligations under this Chapter.
Article 10.22: Transparency Considerations

In developing a new regulation of general application to which this Chapter applies, a Party may consider, in a manner consistent with its laws and regulations, comments regarding how the proposed regulation may affect the operations of financial institutions, including financial institutions of the Party or the other Party. These comments may include:
submissions to a Party by the other Party regarding its regulatory measures that are related to the objectives of the proposed regulation; or

submissions to a Party by interested persons, including the other Party or financial institutions of the other Party, with regard to the potential effects of the proposed regulation.

follow the granting Party’s prescribed application procedures for the relevant immigration formality; and

meet all relevant eligibility requirements for temporary entry or extension of temporary stay.

A Party may refuse to issue an immigration formality to a business person of the other Party if the temporary entry of that person might affect adversely:

Article 12.3: Approaches to Regulation

The Parties recognise the value of competitive markets to deliver a wide choice in the supply of telecommunications services and to enhance consumer welfare, and that economic regulation may not be needed if there is effective competition or if a service is new to a market. Accordingly, the Parties recognise that regulatory needs and approaches differ market by market, and that each Party may determine how to implement its obligations under this Chapter.

In this respect, the Parties recognise that a Party may:

engage in direct regulation either in anticipation of an issue that the Party expects may arise or to resolve an issue that has already arisen in the market;

rely on the role of market forces, particularly with respect to market segments that are, or are likely to be, competitive or that have low barriers to entry, such as services provided by telecommunications suppliers that do not own network facilities; or

use any other appropriate means that benefit the long-term interest of end-users.
Article 12.4: Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Services 2

Each Party shall ensure that any enterprise of the other Party has access to and use of any public telecommunications service, including leased circuits, offered in its territory or across its borders, on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.

Each Party shall ensure that no condition is imposed on access to and use of public telecommunications networks and services, other than as necessary to:

safeguard the public service responsibilities of suppliers of public telecommunications networks and services, in particular their ability to make their networks or services generally available to the public; or

protect the technical integrity of public telecommunications networks or services.

Provided that they satisfy the criteria set out in paragraph 5, conditions for access to and use of public telecommunications networks and services may include:

Article 12.6: International Mobile Roaming

The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on promoting transparent and reasonable rates for international mobile roaming services that can help promote the growth of trade among the Parties and enhance consumer welfare.

A Party may choose to take steps to enhance transparency and competition with respect to international mobile roaming rates and technological alternatives to roaming services, such as:

ensuring that information regarding retail rates is easily accessible to consumers; and

minimising impediments to the use of technological alternatives to roaming, whereby consumers when visiting the territory of a Party from the territory of the other Party can access telecommunications services using the device of their choice.

The Parties recognise that a Party, when it has the authority to do so, may choose to adopt or maintain measures affecting rates for wholesale international roaming services with a view to ensuring that those rates are reasonable. If a Party considers it appropriate, it may cooperate on and implement mechanisms with the other Party to facilitate the implementation of those measures, including by entering into arrangements with that Party.

If a Party (the first Party) chooses to regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services, it shall ensure that a supplier of public telecommunications services of the other Party (the second Party) has access to the regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for its customers roaming in the territory of the first Party in circumstances in which: 4

the second Party has entered into an arrangement with the first Party to reciprocally regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for suppliers of the two Parties;5 or

in the absence of an arrangement of the type referred to in subparagraph (a), the supplier of public telecommunications services of the second Party, of its own accord:

makes available to suppliers of public telecommunications services of the first Party wholesale international mobile roaming services at rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable to the regulated rates or conditions;6 and

meets any additional requirements'7 that the first Party imposes with respect to the availability of the regulated rates or conditions.

The first Party may require suppliers of the second Party to fully utilise commercial negotiations to reach agreement on the terms for accessing such rates or conditions.

A Party that ensures access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be deemed to be in compliance with its obligations under Article 9.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 12.4.1, and Article 12.7 with respect to international mobile roaming services.

Each Party shall ensure that:

suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory, or

its telecommunications regulatory body,

make publicly available retail rates for international mobile roaming services, for voice, data and text messages.

Nothing in this Article shall require a Party to regulate rates or conditions for international mobile roaming services.
Article 12.7: Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services

Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory accords suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that major supplier accords in like circumstances to its subsidiaries, its affiliates or non-affiliated service suppliers regarding:
the availability, provisioning, rates or quality of like public telecommunications services; and

the availability of technical interfaces necessary for interconnection.
Article 12.8: Competitive Safeguards

Each Party shall maintain appropriate measures for the purpose of preventing suppliers of public telecommunications services that, alone or together, are a major supplier in its territory from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices.

The anti-competitive practices referred to in paragraph 1 include in particular:

engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation;

using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and

not making available, on a timely basis, to suppliers of public telecommunications services, technical information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information that are necessary for them to provide services.
Article 12.9: Resale

Neither Party shall prohibit the resale of any public telecommunications service.

Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory:

offers for resale, at reasonable rates8, to suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party, public telecommunications services that the major supplier provides at retail to end-users; and

does not impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of those services.

Each Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which public telecommunications services must be offered for resale by major suppliers pursuant to paragraph 2, based on the need to promote competition or to benefit the long-term interests of end-users.

If a Party does not require that a major supplier offer a specific public telecommunications service for resale, it nonetheless shall allow service suppliers to request that the service be offered for resale consistent with paragraph 2, without prejudice to the Party’s decision on the request.
Article 12.10: Unbundling of Network Elements by Major Suppliers

Each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body or another appropriate body with the authority to require a major supplier in its territory to offer to public telecommunications service suppliers access to network elements on an unbundled basis on terms and conditions, and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent for the supply of public telecommunications services. Each Party may determine the network elements required to be made available in its territory, and the suppliers that may obtain those elements, in accordance with its laws and regulations.

Article 12.11: Interconnection with Major Suppliers

General Terms and Conditions
Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides interconnection for the facilities and equipment of suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party:

at any technically feasible point in the major supplier’s network;

under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications) and rates;

of a quality no less favourable than that provided by the major supplier for its own like services, for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers, or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;

in a timely manner, on terms and conditions (including technical standards and specifications), and at cost-oriented rates, that are transparent, reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the suppliers do not have to pay for network components or facilities that they do not require for the service to be provided; and

on request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.
Options for Interconnecting with Major Suppliers
Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party with the opportunity to interconnect their facilities and equipment with those of the major supplier through at least one of the following options:

a reference interconnection offer or another standard interconnection offer containing the rates, terms and conditions that the major supplier offers generally to suppliers of public telecommunications services;9

the terms and conditions of an interconnection agreement that is in effect; or

the terms and conditions set by a Party’s telecommunications regulatory body or other competent body.

In addition to the options provided in paragraph 2, each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party have the opportunity to interconnect their facilities and equipment with those of the major supplier through the negotiation of a new interconnection agreement.
Public Availability of Interconnection Offers and Agreements
Each Party shall make publicly available the applicable procedures for interconnection negotiations with a major supplier in its territory.

Each Party shall provide means for suppliers of the other Party to obtain the rates, terms and conditions necessary for interconnection offered by a major supplier. Those means include, at a minimum, ensuring:

the public availability of interconnection agreements that are in effect between a major supplier in its territory and other suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory;

the public availability of rates, terms and conditions for interconnection with a major supplier set by the telecommunications regulatory body or other competent body; or

the public availability of a reference interconnection offer or another standard interconnection offer as provided for under paragraph 2(a).
Article 12.12: Provisioning and Pricing of Leased Circuits Services by Major Suppliers

Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides to service suppliers of the other Party leased circuits services that are public telecommunications services in a reasonable period of time on terms and conditions, and at rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory, and based on a generally available offer.

Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body or other appropriate bodies the authority to require a major supplier in its territory to offer leased circuits services that are public telecommunications services to service suppliers of the other Party at capacity-based and cost-oriented prices.
Article 12.13: Co-Location by Major Suppliers

Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides to suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party in the Party’s territory physical co-location of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements based on a generally available offer, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory.

Where physical co-location is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations, each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides an alternative solution, such as facilitating virtual co-location, based on a generally available offer, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory.

Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which premises owned or controlled by major suppliers in its territory are subject to paragraphs 1 and 2. When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the state of competition in the market where co-location is required, whether those premises can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors.

If a Party does not require that a major supplier offer co-location at certain premises, it nonetheless shall allow suppliers to request that those premises be offered for co-location consistent with paragraph 1, without prejudice to the Party’s decision on such a request.
Article 12.14: Access to Poles, Ducts, Conduits and Rights-of-way Owned or Controlled by Major Suppliers

Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way or any other structures as determined by the Party, owned or controlled by the major supplier, to suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party in the Party’s territory on a timely basis, on terms and conditions and at rates, that are reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent, subject to technical feasibility.

A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, the poles, ducts, conduits, rights-of-way or any other structures to which it requires major suppliers in its territory to provide access in accordance with paragraph 1. When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the competitive effect of lack of such access, whether such structures can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors.
Article 12.15: Independent Regulatory Bodies and Government Ownership

Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of public telecommunications services. With a view to ensuring the independence and impartiality of telecommunications regulatory bodies, each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body does not hold a financial interest 10 or maintain an operating or management role in any supplier of public telecommunications services.

Each Party shall ensure that the regulatory decisions and procedures of its telecommunications regulatory body or other competent authority related to provisions contained in this Chapter are impartial with respect to all market participants.

Neither Party shall accord more favourable treatment to a supplier of telecommunications services in its territory than that accorded to a like service supplier of the other Party on the basis that the supplier receiving more favourable treatment is owned by the national government of the Party.
Article 12.16: Universal Service

Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Each Party shall administer any universal service obligation that it maintains in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner, and shall ensure that its universal service obligation is not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service that it has defined.

Article 12.17: Licensing Process

If a Party requires a supplier of public telecommunications services to have a licence, the Party shall ensure the public availability of:

all the licensing criteria and procedures that it applies;

the period that it normally requires to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and

the terms and conditions of all licences in effect.

Each Party shall ensure that, on request, an applicant receives the reasons for the:

denial of a licence;

imposition of supplier-specific conditions on a licence;

revocation of a licence; or

refusal to renew a licence.
Article 12.18: Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources

Each Party shall administer its procedures for the allocation and use of scarce telecommunications resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights-of-way, in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.

Each Party shall make publicly available the current state of frequency bands:

allocated to specific services

assigned to service suppliers to provide access to end-users,

but retains the right not to provide detailed identification of frequencies that are allocated or assigned for specific government uses.

For greater certainty, a Party’s measures allocating and assigning spectrum and managing frequency are not per se inconsistent with Article 9.5 (Market Access) either as it applies to cross-border trade in services or through the operation of Article 9.2.2 (Scope) to an investor or covered investment of the other Party. Accordingly, each Party retains the right to establish and apply spectrum and frequency management policies that may have the effect of limiting the number of suppliers of public telecommunications services, provided that the Party does so in a manner that is consistent with other provisions of this Agreement. This includes the ability to allocate frequency bands, taking into account current and future needs and spectrum availability.

When making a spectrum allocation for commercial telecommunications services, each Party shall endeavour to rely on an open and transparent process that considers the public interest, including the promotion of competition. Each Party shall endeavour to rely generally on market-based approaches in assigning spectrum for terrestrial commercial telecommunications services. To this end, each Party shall have the authority to use mechanisms such as auctions, if appropriate, to assign spectrum for commercial use.
Article 12.19: Enforcement

Each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body or other relevant body with the authority to enforce the Party’s measures relating to the obligations set out in Article 12.4, Article 12.5, Article 12.7, Article 12.8, Article 12.9, Article 12.10, Article 12.11, Article 12.12, Article 12.13 and Article 12.14. That authority11 shall include the ability to impose effective sanctions, which may include financial penalties, injunctive relief (on an interim or final basis), or the modification, suspension or revocation of licences.

Article 12.20: Resolution of Telecommunications Disputes

Further to Article 25.3 (Administrative Proceedings) and Article 25.4 (Review and Appeal), each Party shall ensure that:

Recourse
enterprises have recourse to a telecommunications regulatory body or other relevant body of the Party to resolve disputes regarding the Party’s measures relating to matters set out in Article 12.4, Article 12.5, Article 12.6, Article 12.7, Article 12.8, Article 12.9, Article 12.10, Article 12.11, Article 12.12, Article 12.13 and Article 12.14;

if a telecommunications regulatory body declines to initiate any action on a request to resolve a dispute, it shall, upon request, provide a written explanation for its decision within a reasonable period of time;

suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party that have requested interconnection with a major supplier in the Party’s territory may seek review, within a reasonable and publicly specified period of time after the supplier requests interconnection, by its telecommunications regulatory body12 to resolve disputes regarding the terms, conditions and rates for interconnection with that major supplier; and

Reconsideration13

any enterprise whose legally protected interests are adversely affected by a determination or decision of the Party’s telecommunications regulatory body may appeal to or petition the body or other relevant body to reconsider that determination or decision. Neither Party shall permit the making of an application for reconsideration to constitute grounds for non-compliance with the determination or decision of the telecommunications regulatory body, unless the regulatory or other relevant body issues an order that the determination or decision not be enforced while the proceeding is pending. A Party may limit the circumstances under which reconsideration is available, in accordance with its laws and regulations.

Judicial Review

Neither Party shall permit the making of an application for judicial review to constitute grounds for non-compliance with the determination or decision of the telecommunications regulatory body, unless the judicial body issues an order that the determination or decision not be enforced while the proceeding is pending.
Article 12.21: Transparency

Further to Article 25.2.2 (Publication), each Party shall ensure that when its telecommunications regulatory body seeks input 14 for a proposal for a regulation, that body shall:

make the proposal public or otherwise available to any interested persons;

include an explanation of the purpose of and reasons for the proposal;

provide interested persons with adequate public notice of the ability to comment and reasonable opportunity for such comment;

to the extent practicable, make publicly available all relevant comments filed with it; and

respond to all significant and relevant issues raised in comments filed, in the course of issuance of the final regulation. 15

Further to Article 25.2.1 (Publication), each Party shall ensure that its measures relating to public telecommunications services are made publicly available, including:

tariffs and other terms and conditions of service;

specifications of technical interfaces;

conditions for attaching terminal or other equipment to the public telecommunications network;

licensing, permit, registration or notification requirements, if any;

general procedures relating to resolution of telecommunications disputes provided for in Article 12.20; and

any measures of the telecommunications regulatory body if the government delegates to other bodies the responsibility for preparing, amending and adopting standards-related measures affecting access and use.
Article 12.22: Flexibility in the Choice of Technology

Neither Party shall prevent suppliers of public telecommunications services from choosing the technologies they wish to use to supply their services, subject to requirements necessary to satisfy legitimate public policy interests, provided that any measure restricting that choice is not prepared, adopted or applied in a manner that creates unnecessary obstacles to trade. For greater certainty, a Party adopting those measures shall do so consistent with Article 12.21.

When a Party finances the development of advanced networks, including broadband networks, it may make its financing conditional on the use of technologies that meet its specific public policy interests.
Article 12.23: Relation to Other Chapters

In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter of this Agreement, this Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

Article 12.24: Relation to International Organisations

The Parties recognise the importance of international standards for global compatibility and interoperability of telecommunications networks and services and undertake to promote those standards through the work of relevant international organisations.

Each Party shall list in Section I of its Schedule to Annex 14-A the paper or electronic means through which the Party publishes the information described in paragraph 1 and the notices required by Article 14.6, Article 14.8.3 and Article 14.14.3.

Each Party shall, on request, respond to an inquiry relating to the information referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 14.6: Notices of Intended Procurement

For each covered procurement, except in the circumstances described in Article 14.9, a procuring entity shall publish a notice of intended procurement through the appropriate paper or electronic means listed in Annex 14-A. The notices shall remain readily accessible to the public until at least the expiration of the time period for responding to the notice or the deadline for submission of the tender.

The notices shall, if accessible by electronic means, be provided free of charge:

for central government entities that are covered under Annex 14-A, through a single point of access; and

for sub-central government entities and other entities covered under Annex 14-A, through links in a single electronic portal.

Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, each notice of intended procurement shall include the following information, unless that information is provided in the tender documentation that is made available free of charge to all interested suppliers at the same time as the notice of intended procurement:

the name of the procuring entity and the address where all documents relating to the procurement may be obtained;

a description of the procurement;

if applicable, the time-frame for delivery of goods or services or the duration of the contract;

if applicable, the address and any final date for the submission of requests for participation in the procurement;

the address and the final date for the submission of tenders;

the language or languages in which tenders or requests for participation may be submitted, if other than an official language of the Party of the procuring entity;

a list and a brief description of any conditions for participation of suppliers;

if, pursuant to Article 14.8, a procuring entity intends to select a limited number of qualified suppliers to be invited to tender, the criteria that will be used to select them and, if applicable, any limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender; and

an indication that the procurement is covered by this Chapter, unless that indication is publicly available through information published pursuant to Article 14.5.2.

For greater certainty, paragraph 3 does not preclude a Party from charging a fee for tender documentation if the notice of intended procurement includes all of the information set out in paragraph 3.
Notice of Planned Procurement
Procuring entities are encouraged to publish as early as possible in each fiscal year a notice regarding their future procurement plans (notice of planned procurement), which should include the subject matter of the procurement and the planned date of publication of the notice of intended procurement.
Article 14.7: Conditions for Participation

A procuring entity shall limit any conditions for participation in a covered procurement to those conditions that ensure that a supplier has the legal and financial capacities and the commercial and technical abilities to fulfil the requirements of that procurement.

In establishing the conditions for participation, a procuring entity:

shall not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of a given Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of that Party; and

may require relevant prior experience if essential to meet the requirements of the procurement.

In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for participation, a procuring entity shall:

evaluate the financial capacity and the commercial and technical abilities of a supplier on the basis of that supplier’s business activities both inside and outside the territory of the Party of the procuring entity; and

base its evaluation solely on the conditions that the procuring entity has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation.

If there is supporting material, a Party, including its procuring entities, may exclude a supplier on grounds such as:

bankruptcy or insolvency;

false declarations;

significant or persistent deficiencies in the performance of any substantive requirement or obligation under a prior contract or contracts;

final judgments in respect of serious crimes or other serious offences;

professional misconduct or acts or omissions that adversely reflect on the commercial integrity of the supplier; or

failure to pay taxes.
Article 14.8: Qualification of Suppliers

Registration Systems and Qualification Procedures
A Party, including its procuring entities, may maintain a supplier registration system under which interested suppliers are required to register and provide certain information.

Neither Party, including its procuring entities, shall:

adopt or apply any registration system or qualification procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to the participation of suppliers of the other Party in its procurement; or

use such registration system or qualification procedure to prevent or delay the inclusion of suppliers of the other Party on a list of suppliers or prevent those suppliers from being considered for a particular procurement.
Selective Tendering
If a Party’s measures authorise the use of selective tendering, and if a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, the procuring entity shall:

publish a notice of intended procurement that invites suppliers to submit a request for participation in a covered procurement; and

include in the notice of intended procurement the information specified in Article 14.6.3(a), (b), (d), (g), (h) and (i).

The procuring entity shall:

publish the notice sufficiently in advance of the procurement to allow interested suppliers to request participation in the procurement;

provide, by the commencement of the time period for tendering, at least the information in Article 14.6.3(c), (e) and (f) to the qualified suppliers that it notifies as specified in Article 14.12.3(b); and

allow all qualified suppliers to submit a tender, unless the procuring entity stated in the notice of intended procurement a limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender and the criteria or justification for selecting the limited number of suppliers.

If the tender documentation is not made publicly available from the date of publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 3, the procuring entity shall ensure that the tender documentation is made available at the same time to all the qualified suppliers selected in accordance with paragraph 4(c).
Multi-Use Lists
A Party, including its procuring entities, may establish or maintain a multi-use list provided that it publishes annually, or otherwise makes continuously available by electronic means, a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list. The notice shall include:

a description of the goods and services, or categories thereof, for which the list may be used;

the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers for inclusion on the list and the methods that the procuring entity or other government agency will use to verify a supplier’s satisfaction of those conditions;

the name and address of the procuring entity or other government agency and other information necessary to contact the procuring entity and to obtain all relevant documents relating to the list;

the period of validity of the list and the means for its renewal or termination or, if the period of validity is not provided, an indication of the method by which notice will be given of the termination of use of the list;

the deadline for submission of applications for inclusion on the list, if applicable; and

an indication that the list may be used for procurement covered by this Chapter, unless that indication is publicly available through information published pursuant to Article 14.5.2.
A Party, including its procuring entities, that establishes or maintains a multi-use list, shall include on the list, within a reasonable period of time, all suppliers that satisfy the conditions for participation set out in the notice referred to in paragraph 6.
Information on Procuring Entity Decisions
A procuring entity or other entity of a Party shall promptly inform any supplier that submits a request for participation in a procurement or application for inclusion on a multi-use list of the decision with respect to the request or application.

If a procuring entity or other entity of a Party rejects a supplier’s request for participation or application for inclusion on a multi-use list, ceases to recognise a supplier as qualified, or removes a supplier from a multi-use list, the entity shall promptly inform the supplier and on request of the supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written explanation of the reason for its decision.

The Parties agree to delay the application of the requirements contained under Article 14.8.6(d) and (f) of this Chapter for a period of 3 years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.
Article 14.9: Limited Tendering

Provided that it does not use this provision for the purpose of avoiding competition between suppliers, to protect domestic suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of the other Party, a procuring entity may use limited tendering.

If a procuring entity uses limited tendering, it may choose, according to the nature of the procurement, not to apply Article 14.6, Article 14.7, Article 14.8, Article 14.10, Article 14.11, Article 14.12 or Article 14.13. A procuring entity may use limited tendering only under the following circumstances:

if, in response to a prior notice, invitation to participate or invitation to tender:

no tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation;

no tenders were submitted that conform to the essential requirements in the tender documentation;

no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or

the tenders submitted were collusive,

provided that the procuring entity does not substantially modify the essential requirements set out in the notices or tender documentation;

if the good or service can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute good or service exists for any of the following reasons:

the requirement is for a work of art;

the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or

due to an absence of competition for technical reasons;

for additional deliveries by the original supplier or its authorised agents, of goods or services that were not included in the initial procurement, if a change of supplier for such additional goods or services:

cannot be made for technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services or installations procured under the initial procurement, or due to conditions under original supplier warranties; and

would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the procuring entity;

for a good purchased on a commodity market or exchange;

if a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is intended for limited trial or that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development. Original development of a prototype or a first good or service may include limited production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that the prototype or the first good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards, but does not include quantity production or supply to establish commercial viability or to recover research and development costs. Subsequent procurements of these newly developed goods or services, however, shall be subject to this Chapter;

if additional construction services that were not included in the initial contract but that were within the objectives of the original tender documentation have, due to unforeseeable circumstances, become necessary to complete the construction services described therein. However, the total value of contracts awarded for additional construction services may not exceed 50 per cent of the value of the initial contract;

for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the very short term, such as from unusual disposals, unsolicited innovative proposals, liquidation, bankruptcy or receivership, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers;

if a contract is awarded to the winner of a design contest, provided that:

the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with this Chapter; and

the contest is judged by an independent jury with a view to award a design contract to the winner; or

in so far as is strictly necessary if, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the good or service could not be obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering.

For each contract awarded in accordance with paragraph 2, a procuring entity shall prepare a report in writing, or maintain a record, that includes the name of the procuring entity, the value and kind of good or service procured, and a statement that indicates the circumstances and conditions described in paragraph 2 that justified the use of limited tendering.
Article 14.10: Technical Specifications

A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties.

In prescribing the technical specifications for the good or service being procured, a procuring entity shall, if appropriate:

set out the technical specifications in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and

base the technical specifications on international standards, if these exist; or otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognised national standards or building codes.

A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in these cases, the procuring entity includes words such as “or equivalent” in the tender documentation.

A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement.

For greater certainty, a procuring entity may conduct market research in developing specifications for a particular procurement.

For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a procuring entity from preparing, adopting or applying technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or the protection of the environment.

For greater certainty, this Chapter is not intended to preclude a Party, or its procuring entities, from preparing, adopting or applying technical specifications required to protect sensitive government information, including specifications that may affect or limit the storage, hosting or processing of such information outside the territory of the Party.
Article 14.11: Tender Documentation

A procuring entity shall promptly make available or provide on request to any interested supplier tender documentation that includes all information necessary to permit the supplier to prepare and submit a responsive tender. Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, that tender documentation shall include a complete description of:

the procurement, including the nature, scope and, if known, the quantity of the good or service to be procured or, if the quantity is not known, the estimated quantity and any requirements to be fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity certification, plans, drawings or instructional materials;

any conditions for participation, including any financial guarantees, information and documents that suppliers are required to submit;

all criteria to be considered in the awarding of the contract and the relative importance of those criteria;

if there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time and place for the opening;

any other terms or conditions relevant to the evaluation of tenders; and

any date for delivery of a good or supply of a service.

In establishing any date for the delivery of a good or the supply of a service being procured, a procuring entity shall take into account factors such as the complexity of the procurement.

A procuring entity shall promptly reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by an interested or participating supplier, provided that the information does not give that supplier an advantage over other suppliers.
Modifications
If, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the evaluation criteria or requirements set out in a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation provided to a participating supplier, or amends or re-issues a notice or tender documentation, it shall publish or provide those modifications, or the amended or re-issued notice or tender documentation:

to all suppliers that are participating in the procurement at the time of the modification, amendment or re-issuance, if those suppliers are known to the procuring entity, and in all other cases, in the same manner as the original information was made available; and

in adequate time to allow those suppliers to modify and re-submit their initial tender, if appropriate.
Article 14.12: Time Periods

General
A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time for a supplier to obtain the tender documentation and to prepare and submit a request for participation and a responsive tender, taking into account factors such as:

the nature and complexity of the procurement; and

the time necessary for transmitting tenders by non-electronic means from foreign as well as domestic points if electronic means are not used.
Deadlines
A procuring entity that uses selective tendering shall establish that the final date for the submission of a request for participation shall not, in principle, be less than 25 days from the date of publication of the notice of intended procurement. If a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders this time period impracticable, the time period may be reduced to no less than 10 days.

Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, a procuring entity shall establish that the final date for the submission of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date on which:

in the case of open tendering, the notice of intended procurement is published; or

in the case of selective tendering, the procuring entity notifies the suppliers that they will be invited to submit tenders, whether or not it uses a multi-use list.

A procuring entity may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 by five days for each one of the following circumstances:

the notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means;

the tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement; and

the procuring entity accepts tenders by electronic means.

A procuring entity may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to no less than 10 days if:

the procuring entity has published a notice of planned procurement under Article 14.6 at least 40 days and no more than 12 months in advance of the publication of the notice of intended procurement, and the notice of planned procurement contains:

a description of the procurement;

the approximate final dates for the submission of tenders or requests for participation;

the address from which documents relating to the procurement may be obtained; and

as much of the information that is required for the notice of intended procurement as is available;

a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders impracticable the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3; or

the procuring entity procures commercial goods or services.

The use of paragraph 4, in conjunction with paragraph 5, shall in no case result in the reduction of the time periods for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to less than 10 days.

A procuring entity shall require all interested or participating suppliers to submit requests for participation or tenders in accordance with a common deadline. These time periods, and any extension of these time periods, shall be the same for all interested or participating suppliers.
Article 14.13: Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts

Treatment of Tenders
A procuring entity shall receive, open and treat all tenders under procedures that guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement process and the confidentiality of tenders.

If a procuring entity provides a supplier with an opportunity to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall provide the same opportunity to all participating suppliers.
Awarding of Contracts
To be considered for an award, a tender shall be submitted in writing and shall, at the time of opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in the notice and tender documentation and be submitted by a supplier who satisfies the conditions for participation.

Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, it shall award the contract to the supplier that the procuring entity has determined to be fully capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notice and tender documentation, submits:

the most advantageous tender; or

if price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.

A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a covered procurement, or modify or terminate awarded contracts in order to avoid the obligations of this Chapter.
Article 14.14: Post-Award Information

Information Provided to Suppliers

A procuring entity shall promptly inform suppliers that have submitted a tender of the contract award decision. The procuring entity may do so in writing or through the prompt publication of the notice in paragraph 3, provided that the notice includes the date of award. If a supplier has requested the information in writing, the procuring entity shall provide it in writing.

Subject to Article 14.15, a procuring entity shall, on request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the procuring entity did not select the unsuccessful supplier’s tender or an explanation of the relative advantages of the successful supplier's tender.
Publication of Award Information
A procuring entity shall, promptly after the award of a contract for a covered procurement, publish in an officially designated publication a notice containing at least the following information:

a description of the good or service procured;

the name and address of the procuring entity;

the name and address of the successful supplier;

the value of the contract award;

the date of award or the contract date; and

the procurement method used.
Maintenance of Records
A procuring entity shall maintain the documentation, records and reports relating to tendering procedures and contract awards for covered procurement, including the records and reports provided for in Article 14.9.3, for at least three years after the award of a contract.
Article 14.15: Disclosure of Information

Provision of Information to Parties

Upon request of the other Party, a Party shall provide promptly information sufficient to demonstrate whether a procurement was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with this Chapter, including, if applicable, information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender, without disclosing confidential information. The Party that receives the information shall not disclose it to any supplier, except after consulting with, and obtaining the agreement of, the Party that provided the information.
Non-Disclosure of Information
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not, except to the extent required by law or with the written authorisation of the supplier that provided the information, disclose information that would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of a particular supplier or that might prejudice fair competition between suppliers.

Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party, including its procuring entities, authorities and review bodies, to disclose confidential information if that disclosure:

would impede law enforcement;

might prejudice fair competition between suppliers;

would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons, including the protection of intellectual property; or

would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.
Article 14.16: Ensuring Integrity in Procurement Practices

Each Party shall ensure that criminal or administrative measures exist to address corruption in its government procurement. These measures may include procedures to render ineligible for participation in the Party’s procurements, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, suppliers that the Party has determined to have engaged in fraudulent or other illegal actions in relation to government procurement in the Party’s territory. Each Party shall also ensure that it has in place policies and procedures to eliminate to the extent possible or manage any potential conflict of interest on the part of those engaged in or having influence over a procurement.

Article 14.17: Domestic Review

In the event of a complaint by a supplier of a Party that there has been:

a breach of this Chapter; or

if the supplier does not have a right to directly challenge a breach of this Chapter under the law of a Party, a failure of a procuring entity to comply with the Party’s measures implementing this Chapter,

in the context of a covered procurement in which the supplier has or had an interest, the Party of the procuring entity shall encourage the supplier to seek resolution of its complaint in consultation with the procuring entity. In such instances the procuring entity shall accord timely and impartial consideration to any such complaint and ensure that the making of any such complaint is not prejudicial to the supplier's participation in ongoing or future procurement or right to seek corrective measures under administrative or judicial review procedures.

Each Party shall maintain at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of its procuring entities to receive and review, in a non-discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective manner, complaints that a supplier of the other Party submits, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Party of the procuring entity, relating to a covered procurement.

Each Party shall make information on complaint mechanisms generally available.

If the Revised Agreement on Government Procurement, set out in Annex 4 to the WTO Agreement (Revised GPA) enters into force for Australia, the present Article shall be deemed to be amended at that time so as to conform to the provisions of Article XVIII (Domestic Review Procedures) of the Revised GPA.
Article 14.18: Modifications and Rectifications of Annex 14-A

A Party shall notify the other Party in writing of any proposed modification or rectification (modification) to its Schedule to Annex 14-A. A Party shall provide compensatory adjustments for a change in coverage if necessary to maintain a level of coverage comparable to the coverage that existed prior to the modification. The Party may include the offer of compensatory adjustment in its notice.

A Party is not required to provide compensatory adjustments to the other Party if the proposed modification concerns one of the following:

a procuring entity over which the Party has effectively eliminated its control or influence in respect of covered procurement by that procuring entity; or

rectifications of a purely formal nature and minor modifications to its Schedule to Annex 14-A, such as:

changes in the name of a procuring entity;

the merger of one or more procuring entities listed in its Schedule;

the separation of a procuring entity listed in its Schedule into two or more procuring entities that are all added to the procuring entities listed in the same Section of the Annex; and

changes in website references,

and the other Party does not object under paragraph 3 on the basis that the proposed modification does not concern subparagraph (a) or subparagraph (b).

Proposed modifications shall become effective provided the other Party does not object in writing within 30 days after the date of notification.

When the Parties do not agree on a proposed modification, including a modification regarding a procuring entity on the basis that government control or influence over the entity’s covered procurement has been effectively eliminated, the objecting Party may request additional information including information on the nature of any government control or influence with a view to clarifying and reaching agreement on the proposed modification. The Parties shall make every attempt to resolve the objection through consultations.

The Joint Commission shall modify Annex 14-A to reflect any agreed modification.
Article 14.19: Facilitation of Participation by SMEs

The Parties recognise the important contribution that SMEs can make to economic growth and employment and the importance of facilitating the participation of SMEs in government procurement.

The Parties also recognise the contribution of business alliances between suppliers of each Party in developing the capability of SMEs in government procurement.

If a Party maintains a measure that provides preferential treatment for SMEs, the Party shall ensure that the measure, including the criteria for eligibility, is transparent.
Article 14.20: Cooperation

The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation with a view to achieving a better understanding of their respective government procurement systems, as well as better access to their respective markets, in particular for SMEs suppliers.

The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate in matters such as:

facilitating participation by suppliers in government procurement, in particular, with respect to SMEs;

exchanging experiences and information, such as regulatory frameworks, best practices and statistics; and

developing and expanding the use of electronic means in government procurement systems.
Article 14.21: Contact Points on Government Procurement

Each Party shall designate and notify a contact point on Government Procurement. The contact points shall facilitate the Parties’ efforts to address matters related to the implementation and operation of this Chapter, such as:
cooperation between the Parties, as provided for in Article 14.20;

facilitation of participation by SMEs in covered procurement, as provided for in Article 14.19;

consideration of further negotiations; and

identifying and addressing any problems or other issues that may arise.
CHAPTER 15

COMPETITION POLICY

Article 15.1: Competition Law and Authorities and Anticompetitive Business Conduct

Each Party shall adopt or maintain competition laws that proscribe anticompetitive business conduct, with the objective of promoting economic efficiency and consumer welfare, and shall take appropriate action with respect to that conduct. These laws should take into account the APEC Principles to Enhance Competition and Regulatory Reform, done at Auckland, September 13, 1999.

Each Party shall endeavour to apply its competition laws to all commercial activities in its territory. 1 However, each Party may provide for certain exemptions from the application of its competition laws provided that those exemptions are transparent and are based on public policy or public interest grounds.

Each Party shall maintain an authority or authorities responsible for the enforcement of its competition laws (national competition authorities). Each Party shall provide that it is the enforcement policy of that authority or authorities to act in accordance with the objectives set out in paragraph 1 and not to discriminate on the basis of nationality.
Article 15.2: Procedural Fairness in Competition Law Enforcement

Each Party shall ensure that before it imposes a sanction or remedy against a person for violating its competition laws, it affords that person:

information about the national competition authority’s competition concerns;

a reasonable opportunity to be represented by counsel; and

a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence in their defence, except that a Party may provide for the person to be heard and present evidence within a reasonable time after it imposes an interim sanction or remedy,

in particular, each Party shall afford that person a reasonable opportunity to present evidence or testimony in its defence, including: if applicable, to offer the analysis of a properly qualified expert, to cross-examine any testifying witness; and to review and rebut the evidence introduced in the enforcement proceeding2.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain written procedures pursuant to which its competition law investigations are conducted. If these investigations are not subject to definitive deadlines, each Party’s national competition authorities shall endeavour to conduct their investigations within a reasonable time frame.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain rules of procedure and evidence that apply to enforcement proceedings concerning alleged violations of its competition laws and the determination of sanctions and remedies thereunder. These rules shall include procedures for introducing evidence, including expert evidence if applicable, and shall apply equally to all parties to a proceeding.

Each Party shall provide a person that is subject to the imposition of a sanction or remedy for violation of its competition laws with the opportunity to seek review of the sanction or remedy, including review of alleged substantive or procedural errors, in a court or other independent tribunal established under that Party’s laws.

If a Party’s national competition authority issues a public notice that reveals the existence of a pending or ongoing investigation, that authority shall avoid implying in that notice that the person referred to in that notice has engaged in the alleged conduct or violated the Party’s competition laws.

If a Party’s national competition authority alleges a violation of its competition laws, that authority shall be responsible for establishing the legal and factual basis for the alleged violation in an enforcement proceeding. 3

Each Party shall provide for the protection of business confidential information, and other information treated as confidential under its law, obtained by its national competition authorities during the investigative process. If a Party’s national competition authority uses or intends to use that information in an enforcement proceeding, the Party shall, if it is permissible under its law and as appropriate, provide a procedure to allow the person under investigation timely access to information that is necessary to prepare an adequate defence to the national competition authority’s allegations.

Each Party shall ensure that its national competition authorities afford a person under investigation for possible violation of the competition laws of that Party reasonable opportunity to consult with those competition authorities with respect to significant legal, factual or procedural issues that arise during the investigation.
Article 15.3: Private Rights of Action

For the purposes of this Article, “private right of action” means the right of a person to seek redress, including injunctive, monetary or other remedies, from a court or other independent tribunal for injury to that person’s business or property caused by a violation of competition laws, either independently or following a finding of violation by a national competition authority.

Recognising that a private right of action is an important supplement to the public enforcement of competition laws, each Party should adopt or maintain laws or other measures that provide an independent private right of action.

If a Party does not adopt or maintain laws or other measures that provide an independent private right of action, the Party shall adopt or maintain laws or other measures that provide a right that allows a person:

to request that the national competition authority initiate an investigation into an alleged violation of national competition laws; and

to seek redress from a court or other independent tribunal following a finding of violation by the national competition authority.

Each Party shall ensure that a right provided pursuant to paragraph 2 or 3 is available to persons of the other Party on terms that are no less favourable than those available to its own persons.

A Party may establish reasonable criteria for the exercise of any rights it creates or maintains in accordance with this Article.
Article 15.4: Cooperation

The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation and coordination between their respective national competition authorities to foster effective competition law enforcement in the free trade area. Accordingly, the Parties shall cooperate:

in the area of competition policy by exchanging information on the development of competition policy; and

on issues of competition law enforcement, as appropriate, including through notification, consultation and the exchange of information.

A Party’s national competition authorities may consider entering into a cooperation arrangement or agreement with the competition authorities of the other Party that sets out mutually agreed terms of cooperation.

The Parties agree to cooperate in a manner compatible with their respective laws, regulations and important interests, and within their reasonably available resources.
Article 15.5: Technical Cooperation

Recognising that the Parties can benefit by sharing their diverse experience in developing, applying and enforcing competition law and in developing and implementing competition policies, the Parties shall consider undertaking mutually agreed technical cooperation activities, subject to available resources, including:
providing advice or training on relevant issues, including through the exchange of officials;

exchanging information and experiences on competition advocacy, including ways to promote a culture of competition; and

assisting the other Party as it implements a new national competition law.
Article 15.6: Consumer Protection

The Parties recognise the importance of consumer protection policy and enforcement to creating efficient and competitive markets and enhancing consumer welfare in the free trade area.

For the purposes of this Article, fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities refers to those fraudulent and deceptive commercial practices that cause actual harm to consumers, or that pose an imminent threat of such harm if not prevented, for example:

a practice of making misrepresentations of material fact, including implied factual misrepresentations, that cause significant detriment to the economic interests of misled consumers;

a practice of failing to deliver products or provide services to consumers after the consumers are charged; or

a practice of charging or debiting consumers’ financial, telephone or other accounts without authorisation.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain consumer protection laws or other laws or regulations that proscribe fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities.4

The Parties recognise that fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities increasingly transcend national borders and that cooperation and coordination between the Parties is desirable to effectively address these activities.

Accordingly, the Parties shall promote, as appropriate, cooperation and coordination on matters of mutual interest related to fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities, including in the enforcement of their consumer protection laws.

The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate and coordinate on the matters set out in this Article through the relevant national public bodies or officials responsible for consumer protection policy, laws or enforcement, as determined by each Party and compatible with their respective laws, regulations and important interests and within their reasonably available resources.
Article 15.7: Transparency

The Parties recognise the value of making their competition enforcement policies as transparent as possible.

Recognising the value of the APEC Competition Law and Policy Database in enhancing the transparency of competition laws, policies and enforcement activities, each Party shall endeavour to maintain and update its information on that database.

On request of the other Party, a Party shall make available to the requesting Party public information concerning:

its competition law enforcement policies and practices; and

exemptions and immunities to its competition laws, provided that the request specifies the particular good or service and market of concern and includes information explaining how the exemption or immunity may hinder trade or investment between the Parties.

Article 16.7: Adverse Effects

For the purposes of Article 16.6.1 and Article 16.6.2, adverse effects arise if the effect of the non-commercial assistance is:

that the production and sale of a good by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes from the Party’s market imports of a like good of the other Party or sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party;

that the production and sale of a good by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes from:

the market of the other Party sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the other Party; or

the market of a non-Party imports of a like good of the other Party;

a significant price undercutting by a good produced by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance and sold by the enterprise in:

the market of a Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of the other Party or a like good that is produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market; or

the market of a non-Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of the other Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market;

that services supplied by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displace or impede from the market of the other Party a like service supplied by a service supplier of the other Party; or

a significant price undercutting by a service supplied in the market of the other Party by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance as compared with the price in the same market of a like service supplied by a service supplier of the other Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market.21

For the purposes of paragraphs 1(a), 1(b) and 1(d), the displacing or impeding of a good or service includes any case in which it has been demonstrated that there has been a significant change in relative shares of the market to the disadvantage of the like good or like service. “Significant change in relative shares of the market” shall include any of the following situations:

there is a significant increase in the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise;

the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise remains constant in circumstances in which, in the absence of the non-commercial assistance, it would have declined significantly; or

the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise declines, but at a significantly slower rate than would have been the case in the absence of the non-commercial assistance,

the change must manifest itself over an appropriately representative period sufficient to demonstrate clear trends in the development of the market for the good or service concerned, which, in normal circumstances, shall be at least one year.

For the purposes of paragraphs 1(c) and 1(e), price undercutting shall include any case in which such price undercutting has been demonstrated through a comparison of the prices of the good or service of the state-owned enterprise with the prices of the like good or service.

Comparisons of the prices in paragraph 3 shall be made at the same level of trade and at comparable times, and due account shall be taken for factors affecting price comparability. If a direct comparison of transactions is not possible, the existence of price undercutting may be demonstrated on some other reasonable basis, such as, in the case of goods, a comparison of unit values.

Non-commercial assistance that a Party provides:

before the signing of this Agreement; or

within three years after the signing of this Agreement, pursuant to a law that is enacted, or contractual obligation undertaken, prior to the signing of this Agreement,

shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects.

For the purposes of Article 16.6.1(b) and Article 16.6.2(b), the initial capitalisation of a state-owned enterprise, or the acquisition by a Party of a controlling interest in an enterprise, that is principally engaged in the supply of services within the territory of the Party, shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects.
Article 16.8: Injury

For the purposes of Article 16.6.3, the term “injury” shall be taken to mean material injury to a domestic industry, threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishment of such an industry. A determination of material injury shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of the relevant factors, including the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, the effect of such production on prices for like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, and the effect of such production on the domestic industry producing like goods.22

With regard to the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant increase in the volume of production, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the territory of the Party in which injury is alleged to have occurred. With regard to the effect of the production by the covered investment on prices, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the goods produced and sold by the covered investment as compared with the price of like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, or whether the effect of production by the covered investment is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. No one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance.

The examination of the impact on the domestic industry of the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that received the non-commercial assistance shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, such as actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, or utilisation of capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments and, in the case of agriculture, whether there has been an increased burden on government support programmes. This list is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance.

It must be demonstrated that the goods produced and sold by the covered investment are, through the effects 23 of the non-commercial assistance, causing injury within the meaning of this Article. The demonstration of a causal relationship between the goods produced and sold by the covered investment and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence. Any known factors other than the goods produced by the covered investment which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry shall be examined, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance. Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, among other things, the volumes and prices of other like goods in the market in question, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption, and developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry.

A determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility and shall be considered with special care. The change in circumstances which would create a situation in which non-commercial assistance to the covered investment would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent. In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, there should be consideration of relevant factors24 and of whether the totality of the factors considered lead to the conclusion that further availability of goods produced by the covered investment is imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur.
Article 16.9: Party-Specific Annexes

statistical data permitting an assessment of the effects of the non-commercial assistance on trade or investment between the Parties.

If any relevant points in paragraph 5 have not been addressed in the written response, an explanation shall be provided in the written response itself.

The Parties recognise that the provision of information under paragraphs 5 and 7 does not prejudge the legal status of the assistance that was the subject of the request under paragraph 4 or the effects of that assistance under this Agreement.

When a Party provides written information pursuant to a request under this Article and informs the requesting Party that it considers the information to be confidential, the requesting Party shall not disclose the information without the prior consent of the Party providing the information.

Each Party has the right to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, it being understood that public health crises, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics, can represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency;

in recognition of the commitment to access to medicines that are supplied in accordance with the Decision of the WTO General Council of 30 August 2003 on the Implementation of Paragraph Six of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/L/540) and the WTO General Council Chairman’s Statement Accompanying the Decision (JOB(03)/177, WT/GC/M/82), as well as the Decision of the WTO General Council of 6 December 2005 on the Amendment of the TRIPS Agreement, (WT/L/641) and the WTO General Council Chairperson’s Statement Accompanying the Decision (JOB(05)/319 and Corr. 1,WT/GC/M/100) (collectively, the “TRIPS/health solution”), this Chapter does not and should not prevent the effective utilisation of the TRIPS/health solution; and

with respect to the aforementioned matters, if any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement, or any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement, enters into force with respect to the Parties, and a Party’s application of a measure in conformity with that waiver or amendment is contrary to the obligations of this Chapter, the Parties shall immediately consult in order to adapt this Chapter as appropriate in the light of the waiver or amendment.

These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.

Each Party shall ensure that its procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights are fair and equitable. These procedures shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time limits or unwarranted delays.

This Section does not create any obligation:

to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of each Party to enforce its law in general; or

with respect to the distribution of resources as between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.

Each Party shall provide23, 24 that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities have the authority at least to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person’s intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity.

In determining the amount of damages under paragraph 3, each Party’s judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, among other things, any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits.

At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer, at least in cases described in paragraph 3, to pay the right holder the infringer’s profits that are attributable to the infringement25.

Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to those procedures.

In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or other taking into custody of suspected infringing goods, materials and implements relevant to the infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement.

The requirement to provide that information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.

Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance does not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. A Party may provide that the security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good.

Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio with respect to goods under customs control that are:

imported; or

destined for export.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent authorities may determine after the initiation of the procedures described in paragraph 1, whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property right. If a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an infringement, it may also provide its authorities with the authority to impose administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines or the seizure of the infringing goods following a determination that the goods are infringing.

Article 24.4: Coordination and Review Processes or Mechanisms

The Parties recognise that regulatory coherence can be facilitated through domestic mechanisms that increase interagency consultation and coordination associated with processes for developing regulatory measures. Accordingly, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that it has processes or mechanisms to facilitate the effective interagency coordination and review of proposed covered regulatory measures. Each Party should consider establishing and maintaining a national or central coordinating body for this purpose.

The Parties recognise that while the processes or mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1 may vary between them depending on their respective circumstances (including differences in levels of development and political and institutional structures), they should generally have as overarching characteristics the ability to:

review proposed covered regulatory measures to determine the extent to which the development of such measures adheres to good regulatory practices, which may include but are not limited to those set out in Article 24.5 and make recommendations based on that review;

strengthen consultation and coordination among domestic agencies so as to identify potential overlap and duplication and to prevent the creation of inconsistent requirements across agencies;

make recommendations for systemic regulatory improvements; and

Each Party should generally produce documents that include descriptions of those processes or mechanisms and that can be made available to the public.
Article 24.5: Implementation of Core Good Regulatory Practices

To assist in designing a measure to best achieve the Party’s objective, each Party should generally encourage relevant regulatory agencies, consistent with its laws and regulations, to conduct regulatory impact assessments when developing proposed covered regulatory measures that exceed a threshold of economic impact, or other regulatory impact, where appropriate, as established by the Party. Regulatory impact assessments may encompass a range of procedures to determine possible impacts.

Recognising that differences in the Parties’ institutional, social, cultural, legal and developmental circumstances may result in specific regulatory approaches, regulatory impact assessments conducted by a Party should, among other things:

assess the need for a regulatory proposal, including a description of the nature and significance of the problem;

examine feasible alternatives, including, to the extent possible and consistent with laws and regulations, their costs and benefits, such as risks involved as well as distributive impacts, recognising that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify and monetise;

explain the grounds for concluding that the selected alternative achieves the policy objectives in an efficient manner, including, if appropriate, reference to the costs and benefits and the potential for managing risks; and

rely on the best reasonably obtainable existing information including relevant scientific, technical, economic or other information, within the boundaries of the authorities, mandates and resources of the particular regulatory agency.

When conducting regulatory impact assessments, a Party may take into consideration the potential impact of the proposed regulation on SMEs.

Each Party should ensure that new covered regulatory measures are plainly written and are clear, concise, well organised and easy to understand, recognising that some measures address technical issues and that relevant expertise may be needed to understand and apply them.

Subject to its laws and regulations, each Party should ensure that relevant regulatory agencies provide public access to information on new covered regulatory measures and, where practicable, make this information available online.

Each Party should review, at intervals it deems appropriate, its covered regulatory measures to determine whether specific regulatory measures it has implemented should be modified, streamlined, expanded or repealed so as to make the Party’s regulatory regime more effective in achieving the Party’s policy objectives.

Each Party should, in a manner it deems appropriate, and consistent with its laws and regulations, provide annual public notice of any covered regulatory measure that it reasonably expects its regulatory agencies to issue within the following 12-month period.

To the extent appropriate and consistent with its laws and regulations, each Party should encourage its relevant regulatory agencies to consider regulatory measures in the other Party, as well as relevant developments in international, regional and other fora when planning covered regulatory measures.

training programmes, seminars and other relevant assistance;

strengthening cooperation and other relevant activities between regulatory agencies; and

other activities that Parties may agree.

The Parties further recognise that cooperation by the Parties on regulatory matters can be enhanced through, among other things, ensuring that each Party’s regulatory measures are centrally available.
Article 24.8: Relation to Other Chapters

In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter of this Agreement, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

Each Party, to the extent consistent with the fundamental principles of its legal system, shall consider establishing procedures through which a public official accused of an offence described in Article 25.7.1 may, where appropriate, be removed, suspended or reassigned by the appropriate authority, bearing in mind respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence.

Each Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system and without prejudice to judicial independence, adopt or maintain measures to strengthen integrity, and to prevent opportunities for corruption, among members of the judiciary in matters that affect international trade or investment. These measures may include rules with respect to the conduct of members of the judiciary.

In accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, each Party retains the right for its law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial authorities to exercise their discretion with respect to the enforcement of its anti-corruption laws. Each Party retains the right to take bona fide decisions with regard to the allocation of its resources.

The Parties affirm their commitments under applicable international agreements or arrangements to cooperate with each other, consistent with their respective legal and administrative systems, to enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement actions to combat the offences described in Article 25.7.1.
Article 25.10: Participation of Private Sector and Society

Each Party shall take appropriate measures, within its means and in accordance with fundamental principles of its legal system, to promote the active participation of individuals and groups outside the public sector, such as enterprises, civil society, non-governmental organisations and community-based organisations, in the prevention of and the fight against corruption in matters affecting international trade or investment, and to raise public awareness regarding the existence, causes and gravity of, and the threat posed by, corruption. To this end, a Party may:

undertake public information activities and public education programmes that contribute to non-tolerance of corruption;

adopt or maintain measures to encourage professional associations and other non-governmental organisations, if appropriate, in their efforts to encourage and assist enterprises, in particular SMEs, in developing internal controls, ethics and compliance programmes or measures for preventing and detecting bribery and corruption in international trade and investment;

adopt or maintain measures to encourage company management to make statements in their annual reports or otherwise publicly disclose their internal controls, ethics and compliance programmes or measures, including those that contribute to preventing and detecting bribery and corruption in international trade and investment; and

adopt or maintain measures that respect, promote and protect the freedom to seek, receive, publish and disseminate information concerning corruption.

Each Party shall endeavour to encourage private enterprises, taking into account their structure and size, to:

develop and adopt sufficient internal auditing controls to assist in preventing and detecting acts of corruption in matters affecting international trade or investment; and

ensure that their accounts and required financial statements are subject to appropriate auditing and certification procedures.

Each Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that its relevant anti-corruption bodies are known to the public and shall provide access to those bodies, if appropriate, for the reporting, including anonymously, of any incident that may be considered to constitute an offence described in Article 25.7.1.

A panel shall be composed of three members, including a chair.

Unless the Parties otherwise agree, each Party shall, within 30 days after the date of receipt of the request for the establishment of a panel, appoint one panellist who may be its national and propose up to three candidates to serve as the chair.

If appropriate, the Parties may jointly consult the panellists appointed in accordance with paragraph 2.

If any of the three appointments have not been made within 45 days after the date of receipt of the request for the establishment of a panel, any panellist not yet appointed shall be appointed, on request of either Party, by lot from the list of the candidates proposed in accordance with paragraph 2. The appointment by lot shall be undertaken within seven days after the date of receipt of the request for appointment by lot, unless the Parties otherwise agree. Where more than one panellist, including a chair is to be selected by lot, the chair shall be selected first.

The date of the establishment of a panel shall be the date on which the third panellist is appointed.

If the Parties agree that a panellist has failed to comply with the code of conduct referred to in Article 27.10.1(d), they may remove the panellist, waive the violation or request the panellist to ameliorate the violation within a specified period of time.

If a panellist appointed in accordance with this Article dies, resigns or becomes unable to act, including as a result of his or her removal in accordance with paragraph 6, a successor panellist shall be appointed in the same manner as prescribed for the appointment of the original panellist and shall have all the powers and duties of the original panellist.

Where a panel is reconvened under Article 27.18 or Article 27.19, the reconvened panel shall, where possible, have the same panellists as the original panel. Where this is not possible, a replacement panellist shall be appointed in the same manner as prescribed for the appointment of the original panellist, and shall have all the powers and duties of the original panellist.

Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the panel shall perform its functions and conduct its proceedings in a manner consistent with this Chapter and the Rules of Procedure.

The panel shall consider this Agreement in accordance with the rules of interpretation under international law as reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, done at Vienna on 23 May, 1969. With respect to any provision of the WTO Agreement that has been incorporated into this Agreement, the panel shall also consider relevant interpretations in reports of panels and the WTO Appellate Body adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The findings, determinations and recommendations of the panel shall not add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

A panel shall take its decisions by consensus, except that, if a panel is unable to reach consensus, it may take its decisions by majority vote.
Article 27.12: Rules of Procedure for Panels

administrative assistance is provided to a panel established under Article 27.7.
Article 27.13: Role of Experts

At the request of either Party, or on its own initiative, a panel may seek information and technical advice from any person or body that it deems appropriate, provided that the Parties agree and subject to any terms and conditions agreed by the Parties. The Parties shall have an opportunity to comment on any information or advice obtained under this Article.

Article 27.14: Suspension or Termination of Proceedings

The panel may suspend its work at any time at the request of the complaining Party for a period not to exceed 12 consecutive months. The panel shall suspend its work at any time if the Parties request it to do so. In the event of a suspension, the time frames set out in this Chapter and in the Rules of Procedure shall be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. If the work of the panel is suspended for more than 12 consecutive months, the panel proceedings shall lapse unless the Parties agree otherwise.

The panel shall terminate its proceedings if the Parties request it to do so.
Article 27.15: Initial Report

The panel shall draft its report without the presence of either Party.

The panel shall base its report on the relevant provisions of this Agreement, the submissions and arguments of the Parties, and on any information or advice put before it under Article 27.13. At the joint request of the Parties, the panel may make recommendations for the resolution of the dispute.

The panel shall present an initial report to the Parties no later than 150 days after the date of the appointment of the last panellist. In cases of urgency, including those related to perishable goods, the panel shall endeavour to present an initial report to the Parties no later than 120 days after the date of the appointment of the last panellist.

The initial report shall contain:

findings of fact;

the determination of the panel as to whether:

the measure at issue is inconsistent with obligations in this Agreement;

a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations in this Agreement; or

the measure at issue is causing nullification or impairment within the meaning of Article 27.3.1(c);

any other determination requested in the terms of reference;

the reasons for the findings and determinations.

In exceptional cases, if the panel considers that it cannot release its initial report within the time period specified in paragraph 3, it shall inform the Parties in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of when it will issue its report. A delay shall not exceed an additional period of 30 days unless the Parties agree otherwise.

Panellists may present separate opinions on matters not unanimously agreed.

A Party may submit written comments to the panel on its initial report no later than 15 days after the presentation of the initial report or within another period as the Parties may agree.

No panel shall, either in its initial report or its final report, disclose which panellists are associated with majority or minority opinions.
Article 27.17: Implementation of Final Report

The Parties recognise the importance of prompt compliance with determinations made by panels under Article 27.16 in achieving the aim of the dispute settlement procedures in this Chapter, which is to secure a positive solution to disputes.

If in its final report the panel determines that:

the measure at issue is inconsistent with a Party’s obligations in this Agreement;

a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations in this Agreement; or

the measure at issue is causing nullification or impairment within the meaning of Article 27.3.1(c),

the responding Party shall, whenever possible, eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the responding Party shall have a reasonable period of time in which to eliminate the non-conformity or nullification or impairment if it is not practicable to do so immediately.

The Parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time. If the Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time within a period of 45 days after the presentation of the final report under Article 27.16.1, either Party may, no later than 60 days after the presentation of the final report under Article 27.16.1, refer the matter to the chair to determine the reasonable period of time through arbitration.

The chair shall take into consideration as a guideline that the reasonable period of time should not exceed 15 months from the presentation of the final report under Article 27.16.1. However, that time may be shorter or longer, depending upon the particular circumstances.

The chair shall determine the reasonable period of time no later than 90 days after the date of referral to the chair under paragraph 4.

The Parties may agree to vary the procedures set out in paragraphs 4 through 6 for the determination of the reasonable period of time.
Article 27.18: Non-Implementation – Compensation and Suspension of Benefits

The responding Party shall, if requested by the complaining Party, enter into negotiations no later than 15 days after receipt of that request, with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation, if:

the responding Party has notified the complaining Party that it does not intend to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment; or

following the expiry of the reasonable period of time established in accordance with Article 27.17, there is disagreement between the Parties as to whether the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

A complaining Party may suspend benefits in accordance with paragraph 3 if the complaining Party and the responding Party have:

been unable to agree on compensation within a period of 30 days after the period for developing compensation has begun; or

agreed on compensation but the complaining Party considers that the responding Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement.

A complaining Party may, at any time after the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met, provide written notice to the responding Party that it intends to suspend benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend.3 The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later of the date on which it provides notice under this paragraph or the date that the panel issues its determination under paragraph 5, as the case may be.

In considering what benefits to suspend under paragraph 3, the complaining Party shall apply the following principles and procedures:

it should first seek to suspend benefits in the same subject matter as that in which the panel has determined non-conformity or nullification or impairment to exist;

if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same subject matter, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may suspend benefits in a different subject matter. In the written notice referred to in paragraph 3, the complaining Party shall indicate the reasons on which its decision to suspend benefits in a different subject matter is based; and

in applying the principles set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b), it shall take into account:

the trade in the good, the supply of the service or other subject matter in which the panel has found the non-conformity or nullification or impairment, and the importance of that trade to the complaining Party;

that goods, all financial services covered under Chapter 10 (Financial Services), services other than such financial services, and each section in Chapter 17 (Intellectual Property), are each distinct subject matters; and

the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the broader economic consequences of the suspension of benefits.

If the responding Party considers that:

the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive or the complaining Party has failed to follow the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4; or

it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has determined to exist,

it may, within 30 days of the date of delivery of the written notice provided by the complaining Party under paragraph 3, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter. The responding Party shall deliver its request in writing to the complaining Party. The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after the date of delivery of the request and shall present its determination to the Parties no later than 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request under subparagraph (a) or (b), or 120 days after it reconvenes for a request under both subparagraphs (a) and (b). If the panel determines that the level of benefits the complaining Party proposes to suspend is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect.

Unless the panel has determined that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 5 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 3. If the panel determines that the complaining Party has not followed the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4, the panel shall set out in its determination the extent to which the complaining Party may suspend benefits in which subject matter in order to ensure full compliance with the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4. The complaining Party may suspend benefits only in a manner consistent with the panel’s determination.

The complaining Party shall not suspend benefits if, within 30 days after it provides written notice of intent to suspend benefits or, if the panel is reconvened under paragraph 5, within 20 days after the panel provides its determination, the responding Party provides written notice to the complaining Party that it will pay a monetary assessment. The Parties shall begin consultations no later than 10 days after the date on which the responding Party has given notice that it intends to pay a monetary assessment, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin and are not engaged in discussions regarding the use of a fund under paragraph 8, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 per cent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 5 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 per cent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 3.

If a monetary assessment is to be paid to the complaining Party, then it shall be paid in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the Parties in equal, quarterly instalments beginning 60 days after the date on which the responding Party gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment. If the circumstances warrant, the Parties may decide that the responding Party shall pay an assessment into a fund designated by the Parties for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the Parties, including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting the responding Party to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.

At the same time as the payment of its first quarterly instalment is due, the responding Party shall provide to the complaining Party a plan of the steps it intends to take to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

A responding Party may pay a monetary assessment in lieu of suspension of benefits by the complaining Party for a maximum of 12 months from the date on which the responding Party has provided written notice under paragraph 7 unless the complaining Party agrees to an extension.

A responding Party that seeks an extension of the period for the payment under paragraph 10 shall make a written request for that extension no later than 30 days before the expiration of the 12 month period. The Parties shall determine the length and terms of any extension, including the amount of the assessment.

The complaining Party may suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 6, if:

the responding Party fails to make a payment under paragraph 8 or fails to make the payment under paragraph 13 after electing to do so;

the responding Party fails to provide the plan as required under paragraph 9; or

the monetary assessment period, including any extension, has lapsed and the responding Party has not yet eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

If the responding Party notified the complaining Party that it wished to discuss the possible use of a fund and the Parties do not agree on the use of a fund within three months of the date of the responding Party’s notice under paragraph 7, and this time period has not been extended by agreement of the Parties, the responding Party may elect to make the monetary assessment payment equal to 50 per cent of the amount determined under paragraph 5 or the level proposed by the complaining Party under paragraph 3 if there has been no determination under paragraph 5. If this election is made, the payment must be made within nine months of the responding Party’s notice under paragraph 7 in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the Parties. If the election is not made, the complaining Party may suspend the application of benefits in the amount determined under paragraph 5, or the level proposed by the complaining Party under paragraph 3 if there has been no determination under paragraph 5, at the end of the election period.

The complaining Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the notice provided by the responding Party regarding the possible use of the fund referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13.

Compensation, suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall be temporary measures. None of these measures is preferred to full implementation through elimination of the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. Compensation, suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall only be applied until the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, or until a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.
Article 27.19: Compliance Review

Without prejudice to the procedures in Article 27.18, if a responding Party considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment found by the panel, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing a written notice to the complaining Party. The panel shall issue its report on the matter no later than 90 days after the responding Party provides written notice.

If the panel determines that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party shall promptly reinstate any benefits suspended under Article 27.18.
Section B: Domestic Proceedings and Private Commercial Dispute Settlement

Article 27.20: Private Rights

No Party shall provide for a right of action under its law against the other Party on the ground that a measure of the other Party is inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement, or that the other Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.

Article 27.21: Alternative Dispute Resolution

Each Party shall, to the maximum extent possible, encourage and facilitate the use of arbitration and other means of alternative dispute resolution for the settlement of international commercial disputes between private parties in the free trade area.

To this end, each Party shall provide appropriate procedures to ensure observance of agreements to arbitrate and for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in such disputes.

A Party shall be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph 2 if it is in compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York on 10 June, 1958.

A Party may adopt or maintain restrictive measures with regard to cross-border capital transactions as well as payments or transfers for current account and capital movement transactions:

Article 28.4: Taxation Measures

For the purposes of this Article:

designated authorities means:

for Australia, the Secretary to the Treasury, or its successor, or an authorised representative of the Secretary; and

for Peru, the General Director of International Economy, Competition and Productivity Affairs (Director General de Asuntos de Economía Internacional, Competencia y Productividad del Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas), or its successor;

tax convention means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or other international taxation agreement or arrangement; and

taxes and taxation measures include excise duties, but do not include any import or customs duties.

Except as provided in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures.

This Agreement shall only grant rights or impose obligations with respect to taxation measures where:

corresponding rights and obligations are also granted or imposed under the WTO Agreement; or

they are granted or imposed under:

Chapter 2 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods); or

Article 8.10 (Performance Requirements).

Notwithstanding paragraph 3, nothing in the Articles referred to in that paragraph shall apply to:

any non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure;

the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure;

an amendment to any non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure, provided that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with any of those Articles;

the adoption or enforcement of any new taxation measure aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of taxes including any taxation measure that differentiates between persons based on their place of residence, provided that the taxation measure does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties 5; or

a provision that conditions the receipt, or continued receipt, of an advantage relating to the contributions to, or income of, a pension trust, pension fund, superannuation fund, or other arrangement to provide pension, superannuation, or similar benefits on a requirement that the Party maintain continuous jurisdiction, regulation, or supervision over such trust, fund, or other arrangement.

Article 8.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) shall apply to taxation measures. However, no investor may invoke Article 8.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) as the basis for a claim if it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation. An investor that seeks to invoke Article 8.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the designated authorities of the Party of the investor and the respondent Party, at the time that it gives its notice of intent under Article 8.20 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), the issue of whether that taxation measure is not an expropriation. If the designated authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of the referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 8.20 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). A panel established to consider a dispute related to the measure shall accept as binding a determination of the designated authorities of the Parties made under this paragraph.

Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of either Party under any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency relating to a taxation measure between this Agreement and any such tax convention, that convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

If an issue arises as to whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and a tax convention between the Parties, the issue shall be referred to the designated authorities of the Parties. The designated authorities of the Parties shall have six months from the date of referral of the issue to make a determination as to the existence and extent of the inconsistency. If the designated authorities agree, such a period may be extended up to twelve months from the date of referral of the issue. No procedure concerning the measure giving rise to the issue may be initiated under Chapter 27 (Dispute Settlement) or Chapter 8 (Investment) until the expiry of the six month period, or such other period as may have been agreed by the designated authorities pursuant to the previous sentence. A panel established to consider a dispute related to a taxation measure shall accept as binding a determination of the designated authorities of the Parties made under this paragraph.

Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige a Party to extend to the other Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege arising from any tax convention by which the Party is bound.
Section B: General Provisions

Article 28.5: Disclosure of Information

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to its law or would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.
