being had to the following provisions of the present article.no notifications shall be required for the transit of the animal products to which paragraph i above relates.3. the existence of cattle plague in the country of origin justifies absolute refusal of transit. the discovery of swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, sheep-pox or contagious peri-pneumonia of bovines may justify refusal by the transit countries of the transit of animals susceptible to these diseases, regard being given to the number and position of the centres of infection in the country of origin.4. in the case of an outbreak of cattle plague in the country of origin, the transit of meat and animal products derived from the various species of ruminants may be prohibited.5. transit may in no case be refused for animals and products originating in countries with which the transit country has - at the time the request for transit is made - an import trade in animals and animal products of the same kind ARTICLE

international office for contagious diseases of animals, shall conform to the specimen attached to the present convention.2. certificates may be drawn up in the language of either the exporting or the importing country. the veterinary authorities of the transit country shall be entitled to demand a translation in case of doubt as to the contents of the document ARTICLE 3.in principle, animals may

so constructed as to reduce the dissemination of infectious materials to a minimum ARTICLE 4.i. the transit of live cattle, horses, asses, mules, etc., pigs, sheep, goats and poultry shall be effected through customs offices and ports of landing open to traffic of this character. the transit country is entitled to inspect the sanitary condition of the animals passing in transit, check their certificate of origin and health and endorse it accordingly.2. except where there is a permanent inspection service at the point of entry selected, the competent veterinary officers for frontier inspection must be given due notice - not later than twenty-four hours before their arrival - of consignments of animals in transit as well as of the number of such animals.3. consignments which do not comply with the conditions laid down in article 2, as well as consignments of animals found by the frontier veterinary surgeons to be affected with, or suspected of, a contagious disease and consignments of animals which have been conveyed with or been in contact with affected or suspected animals may be refused admittance at the frontier station of entry of the first transit country. the reason for refusal must be stated in the accompanying papers.4. if the frontier veterinary surgeons of the successive transit countries find that consignments of animals are affected with, or suspected of, a contagious disease, the consignments shall be dealt with in the manner referred to in article 6, paragraph 2, if the frontier veterinary surgeons of the first transit country found that it was healthy, and provided that this fact was noted and mentioned on the certificates of origin and health ARTICLE 5.animals in transit may only be unloaded with the permission and under the control of a government veterinary officer of the transit country or a veterinary surgeon duly authorised for the purpose by the state. they may only be watered, fed, cleaned, or subjected to any treatment in the wagons themselves under veterinary control and subject to the so-called " chain-sealing " system or any other system offering similar guarantees.with a view to meeting the various difficulties arising in the course of transit, the exporting countries shall take steps to see that the animals are properly loaded and suitably fed and that they receive all necessary attention, in order to avoid unnecessary suffering ANNEX to article 5.the high contracting parties shall take all necessary measures to avoid overloading.in the loading of ruminants and pigs, the floors of the transporting vehicles shall be covered with proper litter.consignments of live animals which are not transported in properly closed portable containers (baskets, boxes, cages, etc.) must be

and, as far as possible, by specially accelerated goods trains ARTICLE 6.1. the high contracting parties, through whose territory the transit is to be effected, may make the transit subject to a previous undertaking by the country of destination or other transit countries to admit such animals unconditionally.2. if cattle plague, swine fever, fowl plague, foot-and-mouth disease or contagious peri-pneumonia of cattle is discovered, the transit countries may, at the forwarder's expense, slaughter the infected consignments. in such cases, the circumstances must be clearly stated in a report drawn up by the veterinary officers who took part in the inspection. if there is a veterinary representative of the country of origin in the transit country, he shall be immediately notified in order

necessary in order to check the contents.5. the high contracting parties concerned will endeavour as far as possible to arrange for joint inspection of the certificates ARTICLE 9.1. when the transit transport of meat to which article 7 relates is to be effected through the territory of one or more of the high contracting parties and has as its destination the territory of one of the high contracting parties, it shall not be subject to any previous authorisation.2. if a consignment of meat referred to in article 7 is refused by the country of destination, in respect of which the present convention is in force, it shall rest with the latter to take such steps as it may consider desirable, other than turning back the consignment on to the territory of the last country of transit.3. in the case of transit of meat to which article 7 relates having as its destination a country in respect of which the present convention is not in force, the high contracting parties may make the transit subject to a previous undertaking by the country of destination to admit such meat unconditionally.4. the same previous undertaking may be required from a transit country in respect of which the present convention is not in force ARTICLE 10.the high contracting parties undertake to allow animal products other than those referred to in article 7 to pass also in transit, provided that such products are accompanied, when necessary, by the certificate referred to in that article ARTICLE 11.the transit of meat and of all other animal products liable to carry infection shall be

while the danger exists, refuse to allow transit from the countries from which the contagion was conveyed ARTICLE 14.the high contracting parties undertake to notify one another without delay of all prohibitions and restrictions affecting the transit of live animals, meat and animal products, or the cancellation of such measures ARTICLE 15.nothing in the present convention shall affect the
