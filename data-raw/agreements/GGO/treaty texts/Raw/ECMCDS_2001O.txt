General safeguard clause

1. Where any product of one Party is being imported into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause:

- serious injury to the domestic industry of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing Party, or

- serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region of the importing Party,

the importing Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article.

2. The Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall only apply safeguard measures between themselves in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Such measures shall not exceed what is necessary to remedy the difficulties which have arisen, and should normally consist of the suspension of the further reduction of any applicable rate of duty provided for under this Agreement for the product concerned or the increase of the rate of duty for that product.

Such measures shall contain clear elements progressively leading to their elimination at the end of the set period, at the latest. Measures shall not be taken for a period exceeding one year. In very exceptional circumstances, measures may be taken up to a total maximum period of three years. No safeguard measure shall be applied to the import of a product that has previously been subject to such a measure for a period of, at least, three years since the expiry of the measure.

3. In the cases specified in this Article, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in the cases to which paragraph 4(b) of this Article applies, as soon as possible, the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as the case may be, shall supply the Stabilisation and Association Committee with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the two Parties.

(a) the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in this Article shall be referred for examination to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, which may take any decisions needed to put an end to such difficulties. If the Stabilisation and Association Committee or the exporting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem in accordance with this Article. In the selection of safeguard measures priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement;

(b) where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in this Article, apply forthwith precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.

5. The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Stabilisation and Association Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.

6. In the event of the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in this Article to an administrative procedure having at its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party.

Article 38

Shortage clause

1. Where compliance with the provisions of this Title leads to:

(a) a critical shortage, or threat thereof, of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting Party; or

(b) re-export to a third country of a product against which the exporting Party maintains quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect, and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article.

2. In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement. Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.

3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 of this Article applies, the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as the case may be, shall supply the Stabilisation and Association Committee with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. The Parties within the Stabilisation and Association Committee may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Stabilisation and Association Committee, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article on the exportation of the product concerned.

4. Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, whichever is concerned, may apply forthwith the precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof.

5. Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately notified to the Stabilisation and Association Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their elimination as soon as circumstances permit.

Article 39

State monopolies

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall progressively adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that, by the end of the fifth year following the entry into force of this Agreement, no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States and of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Stabilisation and Association Council shall be informed about the measures adopted to attain this objective.

Article 40

Protocol 4 lays down the rules of origin for the application of tariff preferences provided for in this Agreement.

Article 41

Restrictions authorised

This Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value or the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property, or rules relating to gold and silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties.

Article 42

Both Parties agree to cooperate to reduce the potential for fraud in the application of the trade provisions of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, and in particular Articles 30, 37 and 88 and Protocol 4, where one Party finds that there is sufficient evidence of fraud such as a significant increase in trade of products by one Party to the other Party, beyond the level reflecting economic conditions such as normal production and export capacities, or failure to provide administrative cooperation as required for the verification of evidence of origin by the other Party, both Parties shall enter into consultations immediately to find an appropriate solution. Pending such solution, the Party concerned may take the appropriate measures it deems necessary. In the selection of the measures priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement.

Article 43

The application of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands.

Article 46

Rules shall be laid down for the coordination of social security system for workers with the nationality of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, legally employed in the territory of a Member State, and for the members of their families legally resident there. To that effect, a decision of the Stabilisation and Association Council, which should not affect any rights or obligations arising from bilateral agreements where the latter provide for more favourable treatment, will put the following provisions in place:

- all periods of insurance, employment or residence completed by such workers in the various Member States shall be added together for the purpose of pensions and annuities in respect of old age, invalidity and death and for the purpose of medical care for such workers and such family members,

- any pensions or annuities in respect of old age, death, industrial accident or occupational disease, or of invalidity resulting therefrom, with the exception of non-contributory benefits, shall be freely transferable at the rate applied by virtue of the law of the debtor Member State or States,

- the workers in question shall receive family allowances for the members of their families as defined above.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall accord to workers who are nationals of a Member State and legally employed in its territory, and to members of their families legally resident there, treatment similar to that specified in the second and third indents of the first paragraph.

CHAPTER II ESTABLISHMENT

(c) "branch" of a company shall mean a place of business not having legal personality which has the appearance of permanency, such as the extension of a parent body, has a management and is materially equipped to negotiate business with third Parties so that the latter, although knowing that there will if necessary be a legal link with the parent body, the head office of which is abroad, do not have to deal directly with such parent body but may transact business at the place of business constituting the extension;

(d) "establishment" shall mean:

(i) as regards nationals, the right to set up undertakings, in particular companies, which they effectively control. Business undertakings by nationals shall not extend to seeking or taking employment in the labour market or confer a right of access to the labour market of another Party;

(h) with regard to international maritime transport, including inter-modal operations involving a sea leg, nationals of the Member States or of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia established outside the Community or of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively, and shipping companies established outside the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and controlled by nationals of a Member State or the nationals of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively, shall also be beneficiaries of the provisions of this Chapter and Chapter III, if their vessels are registered in that Member State or in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively, in accordance with their respective legislation;

(i) "financial services" shall mean those activities described in Annex VI. The Stabilisation and Association Council may extend or modify the scope of that Annex.

Article 48

1. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall grant, upon entry into force of this Agreement:

(i) as regards the establishment of Community companies treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies or to any third country company, whichever is the better, and

(ii) as regards the operation of subsidiaries and branches of Community companies in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, once established, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies and branches or to any subsidiary and branch of any third country company, whichever is the better.

2. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall not adopt any new regulations or measures which introduce discrimination as regards the establishment of Community companies on its territory or in respect of their operation, once established, by comparison with its own companies.

3. The Community and its Member States shall grant, from the entry into force of this Agreement:

(i) as regards the establishment of companies from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, treatment no less favourable than that accorded by Member States to their own companies or to any company of any third country, whichever is the better;

(ii) as regards the operation of subsidiaries and branches of companies from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, established in their territory, treatment no less favourable than that accorded by Member States to their own companies and branches, or to any subsidiary and branch of any third country company, established in their territory, whichever is the better.

4. Five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, and in the light of the relevant European Court of Justice case law, and the situation of the labour market, the Stabilisation and Association Council will examine whether to extend the above provisions to the establishment of nationals of both Parties to this Agreement to take up economic activities as self-employed persons.

(c) by the end of the first stage of transitional period the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine the possibility of extending the rights under (b) to branches of the Community companies.

Article 49

1. Subject to the provisions of Article 48, with the exception of financial services described in Annex VI, each Party may regulate the establishment and operation of companies and nationals on its territory, insofar as these regulations do not discriminate against companies and nationals of the other Party in comparison with its own companies and nationals.

2. In respect of financial services, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, a Party shall not be prevented from taking measures for prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owned by a financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. Such measures shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party's obligations under the Agreement.

Article 50

1. The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to air transport services, inland waterways transport services and maritime cabotage services.

2. The Stabilisation and Association Council may make recommendations for improving establishment and operations in the areas covered by paragraph 1.

Article 51

1. The provisions of Articles 48 and 49 do not preclude the application by a Party of particular rules concerning the establishment and operation in its territory of branches of companies of another Party not incorporated in the territory of the first Party, which are justified by legal or technical differences between such branches as compared to branches of companies incorporated in its territory or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.

2. The difference in treatment shall not go beyond what is strictly necessary as a result of such legal or technical differences or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.

Article 52

In order to make it easier for Community nationals and nationals of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to take up and pursue regulated professional activities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Community respectively, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine which steps are necessary for the mutual recognition of qualifications. It may take all necessary measures to that end.

Article 53

1. A Community company or a company from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia established in the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or the Community respectively shall be entitled to employ, or have employed by one of its subsidiaries or branches, in accordance with the legislation in force in the host country of establishment, in the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Community respectively, employees who are nationals of the Community Member States and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively, provided that such employees are key personnel as defined in paragraph 2 and that they are employed exclusively by companies, subsidiaries or branches. The residence and work permits of such employees shall only cover the period of such employment.

2. Key personnel of the abovementioned companies, herein referred to as "organisations", are "intra-corporate transferees" as defined in (c) of this paragraph in the following categories, provided that the organisation is a legal person and that the persons concerned have been employed by it or have been partners in it (other than as majority shareholders), for at least the year immediately preceding such movement:

(a) persons working in a senior position with an organisation, who primarily direct the management of the establishment, receiving general supervision or direction principally from the board of directors or stockholders of the business or their equivalent including:

- directing the establishment of a department or sub-division of the establishment,

- supervising and controlling the work of other supervisory, professional or managerial employees,

- having the authority personally to recruit and dismiss or recommend recruiting, dismissing or other personnel actions;

(b) persons working within an organisation who possess uncommon knowledge essential to the establishment's service, research equipment, techniques or management. The assessment of such knowledge may reflect, apart from knowledge specific to the establishment, a high level of qualification referring to a type of work or trade requiring specific technical knowledge, including membership of an accredited profession;

(c) an "intra-corporate transferee" is defined as a natural person working within an organisation in the territory of a Party, and being temporarily transferred in the context of pursuit of economic activities in the territory of the other Party; the organisation concerned must have its principal place of business in the territory of a Party and the transfer be to an establishment (branch, subsidiary) of that organisation, effectively pursuing like economic activities in the territory of the other Party.

3. The entry into and the temporary presence within the territory of the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of nationals of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Community nationals respectively shall be permitted, when these representatives of companies are persons working in a senior position, as defined in paragraph 2(a) above, within a company, and are responsible for the setting up of a Community subsidiary or branch of a company from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or of a subsidiary or branch in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of a Community company in a Community Member State or in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively, when:

- those representatives are not engaged in making direct sales or supplying services, and

- the company has its principal place of business outside the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, respectively, and has no other representative, office, branch or subsidiary in that Community Member State or former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively.

Article 54

During the first four years following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may introduce measures which derogate from the provisions of this Chapter as regards the establishment of Community companies and nationals of certain industries which:

- are undergoing restructuring, or are facing serious difficulties, particularly where these entail serious social problems in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or

- face the elimination or a drastic reduction of the total market share held by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia companies or nationals in a given sector or industry in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or

- are newly emerging industries in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

Such measures:

(i) shall cease to apply at the latest two years after the end of the first stage of the transitional period;

(ii) shall be reasonable and necessary in order to remedy the situation, and

(iii) shall not introduce discrimination concerning the activities of Community companies or nationals already established in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at the time of introduction of a given measure, by comparison with companies or nationals from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

While devising and applying such measures, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall grant preferential treatment wherever possible to Community companies and nationals, and in no case treatment less favourable than that accorded to companies or nationals from any third country. Prior to the adoption of these measures, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall consult the Stabilisation and Association Council and shall not put them into effect before a one month period has elapsed following the notification to the Stabilisation and Association Council of the concrete measures to be introduced by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, except where the threat of irreparable damage requires the taking of urgent measures, in which case the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall consult the Stabilisation and Association Council immediately after their adoption.

Upon the expiry of the fourth year following the entry into force of this Agreement the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may introduce or maintain such measures only with the authorisation of the Stabilisation and Association Council and under conditions determined by the latter.

CHAPTER III SUPPLY OF SERVICES

Article 55

1. The Parties undertake in accordance with the following provisions to take the necessary steps to allow progressively the supply of services by Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia companies or nationals which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.

2. In step with the liberalisation process mentioned in paragraph 1, the Parties shall permit the temporary movement of natural persons providing the service or who are employed by the service provider as key personnel as defined in Article 53, including natural persons who are representatives of a Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia company or national and are seeking temporary entry for the purpose of negotiating for the sale of services or entering into agreements to sell services for that service provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves.

3. As from the second stage of the transition period, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall take the measures necessary to implement progressively the provisions of paragraph 1. Account shall be taken of the progress achieved by the Parties in the approximation of their laws.

Article 56

1. The Parties shall not take any measures or actions which render the conditions for the supply of services by Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia nationals or companies which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended significantly more restrictive as compared to the situation existing on the day preceding the day of entry into force of the Agreement.

2. If one Party is of the view that measures introduced by the other Party since the entry into force of the Agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of entry into force of the Agreement, such first Party may request the other Party to enter into consultations.

Article 57

With regard to supply of transport services between the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the following provisions shall apply:

1. with regard to inland transport, the relationship between the Parties is governed by the Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the field of transport entered into force on 28 November 1997. The Parties confirm the importance they attach to the correct application of this Agreement;

2. with regard to international maritime transport the Parties undertake to apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to the market and traffic on a commercial basis.

(a) The above provision does not prejudice the rights and obligations under the United Nations Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, as applied by one or the other Party to this Agreement. Non-conference liners will be free to operate in competition with a conference as long as they adhere to the principle of fair competition on a commercial basis;

(b) the Parties affirm their commitment to a freely competitive environment as being an essential of the dry and liquid bulk trade.

3. In applying the principles of paragraph 2, the Parties shall:

(a) not introduce cargo-sharing clauses in future bilateral agreements with third countries, other than in those exceptional circumstances where liner shipping companies from one or other Party to this Agreement would not otherwise have an effective opportunity to ply for trade to and from the third country concerned;

(b) prohibit cargo-sharing arrangements in future bilateral agreements concerning dry and liquid bulk trade;

(c) abolish, upon the entry into force of this Agreement, all unilateral measures and administrative, technical and other obstacles that could have restrictive or discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport.

4. With a view to ensuring a coordinated development and progressive liberalisation of transport between the Parties adapted to their reciprocal commercial needs, the conditions of mutual market access in air transport shall be dealt with by special agreements to be negotiated between the Parties after the entry into force of this Agreement.

5. Prior to the conclusion of the agreement referred to in paragraph 4, the Parties shall not take any measures or actions which are more restrictive or discriminatory as compared with the situation existing prior to the entry into force of this Agreement.

6. During the transitional period, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall adapt its legislation, including administrative, technical and other rules, to that of the Community existing at any time in the field of air and inland transport insofar as it serves liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods.

In step with the common progress in the achievement of the objectives of this Chapter, the Stabilisation and Association Council shall examine ways of creating the conditions necessary for improving freedom to provide air and inland transport services.

CHAPTER I CURRENT PAYMENTS AND MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL

With regard to transactions on the capital and financial account of balance of payments, from the entry into force of the Agreement, the Parties shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to direct investments made in companies formed in accordance with the laws of the host country and investments made in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Title V, and the liquidation or repatriation of these investments and of any profit stemming therefrom.

2. With regard to transactions on the capital and financial account of balance of payments, from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to credits related to commercial transactions or to the provision of services in which a resident of one of the Parties is participating, and to financial loans and credits, with a maturity longer than a year.

They shall also ensure, from the beginning of the second stage, free movement of capital relating to portfolio investment and financial loans and credits with a maturity shorter than a year.

3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Parties shall not introduce any new restrictions on the movement of capital and current payments between residents of the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and shall not make the existing arrangements more restrictive.

4. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 58 and of this Article, where, in exceptional circumstances, movements of capital between the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the operation of exchange rate policy or monetary policy in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, respectively, may take safeguard measures with regard to movements of capital between the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for a period not exceeding six months if such measures are strictly necessary.

5. The Parties shall consult each other with a view to facilitating the movement of capital between the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to promote the objectives of this Agreement.

Article 60

1. During the first stage, the Parties shall take measures permitting the creation of the necessary conditions for the further gradual application of Community rules on the free movement of capital.

Article 68

1. The Parties recognise the importance of the approximation of the existing and future laws of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to those of the Community.

Article 69

Competition and other economic provisions

1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia:

3. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii), the Parties recognise that during the first four years after the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall be assessed taking into account the fact that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

(b) Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid, inter alia by reporting annually to the other Party on the total amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing, upon request, information on aid schemes. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid.

Each Party shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are applied within five years of the Agreement's entry into force.

In relation to migration, the Parties agree to the fair treatment of nationals of other countries who reside legally on their territories and to promote an integration policy aiming at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of their citizens.

The Stabilisation and Association Council can recommend additional subjects for cooperation under this Article.

Article 76

Prevention and control of illegal immigration; readmission

1. The Parties agree to cooperate in order to prevent and control illegal immigration. To this end:

- the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia agrees to readmit any of its nationals illegally present on the territory of a Member State, upon request by the latter and without further formalities once such persons have been positively identified as such,

- and each Member State of the European Union agrees to readmit any of its nationals illegally present on the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, upon request by the latter and without further formalities once such persons have been positively identified as such.

The Member States of the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will provide their nationals with appropriate identity documents and will extend to them the administrative facilities necessary for such purposes.

Article 5

1. In view of the disciplines stipulated by Article 69 of this Agreement, the Parties recognise the need and urgency that each Party addresses promptly any structural weaknesses of its steel sector to ensure the global competitiveness of its industry. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall therefore establish within two years the necessary restructuring and conversion programme for its steel industry to achieve viability of this sector under normal market conditions. Upon request, the Community shall provide former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the appropriate technical advice to achieve this objective.

2. Further to the disciplines stipulated by Article 69 of this Agreement, any practices contrary to that Article shall be assessed on the basis of specific criteria arising from the application of the State aid disciplines of the Community, including its secondary legislation, and including any specific rules on State aid control applicable to the steel sector after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.

3. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii) of Article 69 of this Agreement with regard to steel products, the Community recognises that during five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may exceptionally grant State aid for restructuring purposes provided that:

- it leads to the viability of the benefiting firms under normal market conditions at the end of the restructuring period, and

- the amount and intensity of such aid are strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore such viability and are progressively reduced, and

- the restructuring programme is linked to a global rationalisation and reduction of capacity in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

4. Each Party shall ensure full transparency with respect to the implementation of the necessary restructuring and conversion programme by a full and continuous exchange of information to the other Party, including details on the restructuring plan as well as amount, intensity and purpose for any State aid granted on the basis of paragraph 2 and 3 of this Article.

6. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice of the other Party is incompatible with the terms of this Article, and if that practice causes or threatens to cause prejudice to the interests of the first Party or material injury to its domestic industry, this Party may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Contact Group referred to in Article 8, or after thirty working days following referral for such consultation.

Article 6

The provisions of Articles 19, 20 and 34 of the Agreement shall apply to trade between the Parties in steel products.

Article 7

1. The Contracting Parties recognise the need for an administrative procedure having as its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend in trade flows in respect of the trade in steel products originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to increase transparency and to avoid possible diversions of trade.

2. The Contracting Parties therefore agree to establish a double-checking system, without quantitative limits, for the import into the Community of steel products originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; to exchange statistical information on export and surveillance documents and to hold consultations promptly on any problems arising from the operation of such a system.

3. The details of the double-checking system are contained in Annex I to this Protocol. The continuing need for this system shall be regularly reviewed. The Annex may subsequently be amended or the double-checking system abolished by means of a Decision of the Stabilisation and Association Council.

Article 8

The Parties agree that one of the special bodies established by the Stabilisation and Association Council shall be a contact group, which will discuss the implementation of this Protocol.

It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6(1).

Article 4

Bilateral cumulation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

Materials originating in the Community shall be considered as materials originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6(1).

Article 5

Wholly obtained products

Article 9

Accessories, spare parts and tools

Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.

Article 10

Sets

Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.

4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 8(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 9 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 10 when such items are non-originating.

5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which the Agreement applies.

If they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

4. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of an EC Member State or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

5. The issuing customs authorities shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.

7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

Article 18

Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding Article 17(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

(a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or

(b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.

2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.

3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file.

4. Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with one of the following phrases:"NACHTRÄGLICH AUSGESTELLT", "DELIVRE A POSTERIORI", "RILASCIATO A POSTERIORI", "AFGEGEVEN A POSTERIORI", "ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY", "UDSTEDT EFTERFØLGENDE", "ΕΚΔΟΘΕΝ ΕΚ ΤΩΝ ΥΣΤΕΡΩΝ", "EXPEDIDO A POSTERIORI", "EMITIDO A POSTERIORI", "ANNETTU JÄLKIKÄTEEN", "UTFÄRDAT I EFTERHAND", "DOPOLNITELNO IZDADENO"

5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the "Remarks" box of the movement certificate EUR.1.

Article 19

Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with one of the following words:

"DUPLIKAT", "DUPLICATA", "DUPLICATO", "DUPLICAAT", "DUPLICATE", "ΑΝΤΙΓΡΑΦΟ", "DUPLICADO", "SEGUNDA VIA", "KAKSOISKAPPALE", "DUPLIKAT"

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the "Remarks" box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.

4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.

Article 20

Issue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously

When originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.

Article 21

Conditions for making out an invoice declaration

1. An invoice declaration as referred to in Article 16(1)(b) may be made out:

(a) by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 22, or

(b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed EUR 6000.

2. An invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

3. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

4. An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.

5. Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 22 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.

6. An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.

Article 22

Approved exporter

1. The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter who makes frequent shipments of products under this Agreement to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

2. The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.

3. The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the invoice declaration.

4. The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.

Article 23

Validity of proof of origin

1. A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.

2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.

3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.

Article 24

Submission of proof of origin

Proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of the Agreement.

Article 25

Importation by instalments

Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or heading Nos 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.

Article 26

Exemptions from proof of origin

1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.

2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.

3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.

Article 27

Supporting documents

The documents referred to in Articles 17(3) and 21(3) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration can be considered as products originating in the Community or in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist inter alia of the following:

(a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal bookkeeping;

(b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;

(c) documents proving the working or processing of materials in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, issued or made out in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where these documents are used in accordance with domestic law;

(d) movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in accordance with this Protocol.

4. The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them.

Article 29

Discrepancies and formal errors

1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.

2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.

Article 30

Amounts expressed in euro

1. For the application of the provisions of Article 21(1)(b) and Article 26(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currency of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually.

2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 21(1)(b) or Article 26(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of the relevant amount.

4. The Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent to an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less that 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.

5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Stabilisation and Association Committee at the request of the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. When carrying out this review, the Stabilisation and Association Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.

TITLE VI ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION

Article 31

Mutual assistance

1. The customs authorities of the EC Member States and of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and invoice declarations.

2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 or the invoice declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.

Article 32

Verification of proofs of origin

1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof or origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.

3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.

4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.

5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.

Article 33

Dispute settlement

Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 32 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Stabilisation and Association Committee.

In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.

Article 34

Penalties

Penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.

Article 35

Free zones

1. The Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.

2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.

TITLE VII CEUTA AND MELILLA

Article 36

Application of the Protocol

TITLE VIII FINAL PROVISIONS

Article 38

Amendments to the Protocol

The Stabilisation and Association Council may decide to amend the provisions of this Protocol.

ANNEX I

INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II

Note 1:

The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 6.

Note 2:

2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or Chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or Chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.

2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a Chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the Chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.

2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.

2.4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.

Note 3:

3.1. The provisions of Article 6, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or in the Community.

Example:

An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from "other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging" of heading No ex 7224.

If this forging has been forged in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.

3.2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.

3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule states that "materials of any heading" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression "manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No ..." means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product and of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.

3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.

Example:

The rule for fabrics of headings Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.

3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).

Example:

The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.

However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.

Example:

In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is, the fibre stage.

3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.

Note 4:

4.1. The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.

4.2. The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of headings Nos 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings Nos 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings Nos 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings Nos 5301 to 5305.

4.3. The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.

4.4. The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings Nos 5501 to 5507.

Note 5:

5.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below.)

5.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials: ANNEX II

3. Duly authorised officials of a Contracting Party may, with the agreement of the other Contracting Party involved and subject to the conditions laid down by the latter, be present to obtain in the offices of the requested authority or any other concerned authority in accordance with paragraph 1, information relating to activities that are or may be operations in breach of customs legislation which the applicant authority needs for the purposes of this Protocol.

4. Information obtained shall be used solely for the purposes of this Protocol. Where one of the Contracting Parties wishes to use such information for other purposes, it shall obtain the prior written consent of the authority which provided the information. Such use shall then be subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority.

JOINT DECLARATIONS

JOINT DECLARATION ON ARTICLE 34

The European Communities and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, aware of the impact that the sudden elimination of the 1 % fee applied for customs clearance purposes to imported goods could have on the budget of the latter, agree, as an exceptional measure, that the fee would be maintained until 1 January 2002 or until the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, whichever occurs first.

Should this fee, in the meantime, be reduced or eliminated vis-à-vis a third country, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia undertakes to immediately apply the same treatment to goods of EC origin.

The content of this Joint Declaration is without prejudice to the position of the European Communities in the negotiations on the accession of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the World Trade Organisation.

2. The Community is prepared to grant cumulation of origin to the States that emerged from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which have restored normal economic and trade cooperation as soon as the administrative cooperation needed for cumulation to work properly has been established.

3. With this in mind, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia declares its readiness to enter into negotiations as soon as possible in order to establish cooperation with other States that emerged from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

- violation of the essential elements of the Agreement set out in Article 2.

(b) The Parties agree that the "appropriate measures" referred to in Article 118 are measures taken in accordance with international law. If a Party takes a measure in a case of special urgency pursuant to Article 118, the other Party may avail itself of the dispute settlement procedure.
