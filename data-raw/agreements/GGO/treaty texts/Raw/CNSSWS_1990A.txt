agreement on the conservation of seals in the wadden seasource: the parties,recognizing that seals are an irreplaceable component of the wadden sea ecosystem and that they are of great importance as indicators of its condition;aware that they constitute a separate population whose main range and the main migration routes are located in the wadden sea and which should, as a consequence, be managed as a single unit;deeply concerned by the conservation status of that population, which as the result of mass deaths of seals has been reduced to the lowest level ever recorded;with a view to improving this conservation status through concerted action on the part of the states that exercise jurisdiction over the range of that population;recalling the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals signed at bonn on 23 june 1979 and notably its appendix ii which was amended in 1985 to include the wadden sea population of the common or harbour seal;recalling the joint declaration on the protection of the wadden sea, adopted at the third governmental meeting on the protection of the wadden sea in copenhagen on 9 december 1982;recalling the declarations adopted by the first international conference on the protection of the north sea, bremen, 1 november 1984, and the second international conference on the protection of the north sea, london, 25 november

all sandbanks therein as well as all shore areas of the north sea coasts of denmark, the federal republic of germany and the netherlands between blaavandshuk to the north and den helder to the west. the main ranges and the main migration routes are located in the wadden sea;c) "seal population" means all seals which, at any time, are present in the agreement area;d) "habitat" means any part of the agreement area which is essential to the maintenance of the vital biological functions of seals, including but not limited to breeding, whelping, nursing, feeding or resting;e) "convention" means

have the same meaning in this agreement.iii. purpose and objectthe parties shall cooperate closely with a view to achieving and maintaining a favourable conservation status for the seal population.iv. conservation and management planthe parties shall develop on the basis of scientific knowledge a conservation and management plan for the seal population. this plan shall contain a comprehensive statement of actions which are or are to be undertaken by the parties to achieve the goals of this agreement. the parties shall keep the plan under review and amend it, as may be required, taking into consideration, in particular, the results of scientific research.v. research and monitoring1. the parties shall co-ordinate their research programmes and projects and their monitoring of the seal population to increase their knowledge of the biology and the habitats including harmful effects of human activities on the seal population to provide a basis for measures to improve its conservation status.2. they shall, in particular, monitor and co-ordinate their research on,a) population trends e. g. through periodic aerial surveys and counts;b) seal migration;c) seal population parameters, e. g. diseases, survival, age structure, sex ratio.vi. taking1. the parties shall prohibit the taking of seals from the wadden sea.2. the competent authorities may grant exemptions from the prohibition referred to in the first paragraph authorizing persons to take seals:-for institutions to be designated performing scientific research into the conservation of the seal population in the wadden sea or the conservation of the wadden sea ecosystem, insofar as the information required for such research cannot be obtained in any other way; or-for institutions to be designated nursing seals in order to release them after recovery, insofar as these are diseased or weakened seals or evidently abandoned suckling seals.seals which are clearly suffering and cannot survive may be killed by the persons referred to in this paragraph.3. any party having granted exemptions as mentioned above shall notify the other parties as soon as possible and provide them with an opportunity for review and

projects regarding seal diseases and the effects on the seal population of such substances, e. g. organochlorine compounds, heavy metals and oil, and agree on methods which permit a comparison of research results;c) monitor in the agreement area, in particular in seal tissues and in organisms which are preyed upon by seals, the levels of those substances which in the light of the results of research appear to play a major role in the conservation status of the seal population.ix. responsible authoritieseach party shall inform the other parties of the authorities which shall be
