interim convention on conservation of north pacific fur sealssource: done at washington on 9 february 1957the governments of canada, japan, the union of soviet socialist republics, and the united states of america,desiring to take effective measures towards achieving the maximum sustainable productivity of the fur seal resources of the north pacific ocean so that the fur seal populations can be brought to and maintained at the levels which will provide the greatest harvest year after year, with due regard to their relation to the productivity of other living marine resources of the area,recognizing that in order to determine such measures it is necessary to conduct adequate scientific research on the said resources, anddesiring to provide for international cooperation in achieving these objectives,agree as follows: ARTICLE i1. the term "pelagic sealing" is hereby defined for the purposes of this convention as meaning the killing, taking, or hunting in any manner whatsoever of fur seals at sea.2. the words "each year", "annual" and "annually" as used hereinafter refer to the convention year, that is, the year beginning on the date of entry into force of the convention.3. nothing in this convention shall be deemed to affect in any way the position of the parties in regard to the limits of territorial waters or to the jurisdiction over fisheries ARTICLE ii1. in order to realize the objectives of this convention, the parties agree to co-ordinate necessary scientific research programs and to cooperate in investigating the fur seal resources of the north pacific ocean to determine:a) what measures may be necessary to make possible the maximum sustainable productivity of the fur seal resources so that the fur seal populations can be brought to and maintained at the levels which will provide the greatest harvest year after year; andb) what the relationship is between fur seals and other living marine resources and whether fur seals have detrimental effects on other living marine resources substantially exploited by any of the parties and, if so, to what extent.2. the research referred to in the preceding paragraph shall include studies of the following subjects:a) size of each fur seal herd and its age and sex composition;b) natural mortality of the different age groups and recruitment of young to each age or size class at present and subsequent population levels;c) with regard to each of the herds, the effect upon the magnitude of recruitment of variations in the size and the age and sex composition of the annual kill;d) migration routes of fur seals and their wintering areas;e) numbers of seals from each herd found on the migration routes and in wintering areas and their ages and sexes;f) relationship between fur seals and other living marine resources, including the extent to which fur seals affect commercial fish catches, the damage fur seals inflict on fishing gear, and the effect of commercial fisheries on the fur seals;g) effectiveness of each method of sealing from the viewpoint of management and rational utilization of fur seal resources for conservation purposes;h) quality of sealskins by sex, age, and time and method of sealing;i) effect of man-caused environmental changes on the fur seal populations; andj) other subjects involved in achieving the objectives of the convention, as determined by the commission established under article v, paragraph 1.3. in furtherance of the research referred to in this article, the parties agree:a) to continue to mark adequate numbers of pups;b) to devote to pelagic research an effort which, to the greatest extent possible, should be similar in extent to that expended in recent years, provided that this shall not involve the annual taking by all the parties combined of more than 2,500 seals in the eastern and more than 2,200 seals in the western pacific oceans, unless the commission, pursuant to article v, paragraph 3, shall decide otherwise, andc) to carry out the determinations made by the commission pursuant to article v, paragraph 3.4. each party agrees to provide the commission annually with information on:a) number of black pups tagged for each breeding area;b) number of fur seals, by sex and estimated age, taken at sea and on each breeding area;
