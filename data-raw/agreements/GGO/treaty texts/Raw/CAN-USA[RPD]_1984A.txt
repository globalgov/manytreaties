PREAMBULE

The Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America,

Bearing in mind the purpose of the Boundary Waters Treaty, in particular with respect to the prevention of disputes between Canada and the United States regarding the use of boundary waters;

Recognizing the desirability of preserving the natural environment of the Skagit Valley, in the Province of British Columbia;

Acknowledging the importance to the economic growth and development of the City of Seattle of the electrical power that would have been produced by the raising of the Ross Dam;

Noting with approval the Agreement dated March 30, 1984 between the Province of British Columbia and the City of Seattle developed under the auspices of the International Joint Commission; and

Having encouraged the achievement of such a settlement and being desirous of securing and promoting the cooperative measures undertaken therein,

Have agreed as follows:
Article I

    "Agreement" means the Agreement entered into between British Columbia and Seattle on March 30, 1984, and its several appendices, contained in the Annex to this Treaty;

    "British Columbia" means the Province of British Columbia, Canada;
    "Seattle" means the City of Seattle, in the State of Washington, United States of America;

Article II

Authorizations

     
        In the event that British Columbia discontinues its obligation to deliver electrical power to Seattle under the Agreement or an arbitration tribunal determines that conduct of British Columbia constitutes a material breach of the Agreement, Seattle is, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Treaty and the Agreement, authorized to raise the level of Ross Lake on the Skagit River by means of construction and operation of Ross Dam to a normal full pool elevation of 1725.0 feet, subject to the terms and conditions contained in Opinion No. 808 of the United States Federal Power Commission issued July 5, 1977, Opinion No. 808A of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued August 2, 1978, and in other actions of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in implementation thereof, including provisions for High Ross Dam in the relicensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of Seattle's Project No. 553, of which Ross Dam is a part.
        This authority is to be exercised by Seattle at its option, without regard to any United States law, decision, regulation or order which might be argued as limiting or negating this authority, including provisions of the Federal Power Act relating to the time in which project construction must otherwise commence or to the term of license, or any other provision, during the term of this Treaty, provided that full compensation to British Columbia in the event of operation of Ross Lake at a normal full pool elevation of 1725.0 feet shall be as provided for in the Agreement and in lieu of any conditions in Opinions 808 and 808A or in any licensing order or orders for Project No. 553 with respect to British Columbia, and provided further that unless and until the normal full pool elevation of Ross Lake is thus raised, Seattle shall not be required to pay any increase in annual charges attendant thereupon under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act.
    The Government of Canada shall obtain the legislative or other authority necessary to enable British Columbia to export electrical power in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

Article III

Water Levels at the Boundary

    During the term of this Treaty, Seattle shall be permitted to operate Ross Lake so as to maintain the level of the Skagit River at the Canada-United States boundary at an elevation consistent with a normal full pool elevation of 1602.5 feet.
    During the term of this Treaty, British Columbia shall be permitted to operate Seven Mile Reservoir so as to raise the level of the Pend d'Oreille River at the Canada - United States boundary to an elevation consistent with a normal full pool elevation of 1730.0 feet, subject to the delivery by British Columbia to Seattle of energy and capacity lost at Boundary Dam due to tailwater encroachment by the Seven Mile Reservoir.
    In the event that Seattle discontinues its obligation under the Agreement to make payments to British Columbia for the delivery of electrical power or an arbitration tribunal determines that conduct of Seattle constitutes a material breach of the Agreement, Seattle shall not be permitted to operate Ross Lake so as to raise the level of the Skagit River at the Canada - United States boundary above a level consistent with a normal full pool elevation of 1602.5 feet.

    In the event that either Seattle or British Columbia discontinues its respective obligations in accordance with paragraph 3 or paragraph 4 of this Article, or an ar-bitration tribunal determines that conduct of either constitutes a material breach of the Agreement, British Columbia nonetheless shall be permitted to operate Seven Mile Reservoir so as to maintain the level of the Pend d'Oreille River at the Canada-United States boundary at an elevation consistent with a normal full pool elevation of 1730.0 feet.
    Notwithstanding paragraph 5 of this Article, in the event that British Columbia discontinues its obligation under the Agreement to deliver electrical power to Seattle or an arbitration tribunal determines that conduct of British Columbia constitutes a material breach of the Agreement, and the obligation of British Columbia to make payment under subparagraph 9(C)(iv) of the Agreement is not met, British Columbia shall not be permitted to operate Seven Mile Reservoir so as to maintain the level of the Pend d'Oreille River at the Canada - United States boundary above a level consistent with a normal full poo1 elevation of 1715.0 feet.
