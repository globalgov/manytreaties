boats.as a rule, if decked boats shoot their nets to windward of undecked boats which have begun fishing, or if undecked boats shoot their nets to leeward of decked boats which have begun fishing, the responsibility as regards any damages to nets which may result shall rest with the boats which last began fishing, unless they can prove that they were under stress of compulsory circumstances, or

not be cut without the consent of both parties.all responsibility shall cease if the impossibility of disengaging the nets by any other means is proved ARTICLE xxiii.when a boat fishing with long

sea, whether marked or unmarked, shall as soon as possible be delivered to the competent authority of the first port to which the salving boat returns or puts in.such authority shall inform the consul or consular agent of the country to which the boat of the salvor belongs, and of the nation of the owners of the articles found. they [the same authority] shall restore the articles to the owners thereof or to their representatives, as soon as such articles are claimed and the interests of the salvors have been properly guaranteed.the administrative or judicial authorities, according as the laws of the different countries may provide, shall fix the amount which the owners shall pay to the salvors.it is, however, agreed that this provision shall not in any way prejudice such conventions respecting this matter as are already in force, and that the high contracting parties reserve the right of regulating, by special arrangements between themselves, the amount of salvage at a fixed rate per net salved.fishing implements of any kind found unmarked shall be treated as wreck ARTICLE xxvi.the superintendence of the fisheries shall be exercised by vessels belonging to the national navies of the high contracting parties. in the case of belgium, such vessels may be vessels belonging to the state, commanded by captains who hold commissions ARTICLE xxvii.the execution of the regulations

acquaint each other with any infractions of the above-mentioned regulations committed by the fisher-men of another nation ARTICLE xxviii.the cruizers of all the high contracting parties shall be competent to authenticate all infractions of the regulations prescribed by the present convention, other than those referred to in article xxvii, and all offences relating to fishing operations, whichever may be the nation to which the fishermen guilty of such infractions may belong ARTICLE xxix.when the commanders of cruizers have reason to believe that an infraction of the provisions of the

necessary for the purpose of obtaining proof of an offence or of a contravention of regulations respecting the police of the fisheries ARTICLE xxx.the commanders of the cruizers of the signatory powers shall exercise their judgment as to the gravity of facts brought to their knowledge, and of which they are empowered to take cognizance, and shall verify the damage, from whatever cause arising, which may be sustained by fishing boats of the nationalities of the high contracting parties.they shall draw up, if there is occasion for it, a formal statement of the verification of the facts as elicited both from the declarations of the parties interested and from the testimony of those present.the commander of the cruizer may, if the case appears to him sufficiently serious to justify the step, take the offending boat into a port of the nation to which the fisherman belongs. he may even take on board the cruizer a part of the crew of the fishing boat in order to hand them over to the authorities of her nation ARTICLE xxxi.the formal statement referred to in the preceding article shall be drawn up in the language of the commander of the cruizer, and according to the forms in use in his country.the accused and the witnesses shall he entitled to add, or to have added, to such statement, in their own language, any observations or evidence which they may think suitable. such declarations must be duly signed ARTICLE xxxii.resistance to the directions of commanders of cruizers charged with the police of the fisheries, or of those who act under their orders, shall, without taking into account the nationality of the cruizer, be considered as resistance to the authority of the nation of the fishing boat ARTICLE xxxiii.when the act alleged is not of a serious character, but has nevertheless caused damage to any fisherman, the commanders of cruizers shall be at liberty, should the parties concerned agree to it, to arbitrate at sea between them, and to fix the compensation to be paid.where one of the parties is not in a position to settle the matter at once, the commanders shall cause the parties concerned to sign in duplicate a formal document specifying the compensation to he paid.one copy of this document shall remain on board the cruizer, and the other shall be handed to the master of the boat to which the compensation is due, in order that he may, if necessary, be able to make use of it before the courts of the country to which the debtor belongs.where, on the contrary, the parties do not consent to arbitration, the commanders shall act in accordance with the provisions of article xxx ARTICLE xxxiv.the prosecutions for offences against, or contraventions of, the present convention shall be instituted by, or in the name of,
