schumann, minister for foreign affairs;the president of the federal republic of germany: mr. willy brandt, federal minister for foreign affairs,who, having exchanged their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed on the following provisions: ARTICLE igeneral principles of the development ARTICLE 1definition of the works1. the french republic and the federal republic of germany shall jointly develop, in accordance with the following articles:the gambsheim barrage by means of a fixed dam in the bed of the river, a movable weir on the german bank, a set of locks and a hydroelectric plant on the french bank, levees, side-channels and the necessary appurtenant works;the iffezheim barrage by means of a fixed dam in the bed of the river, a movable weir on the french bank, a set of locks and a hydroelectric plant on the german bank, levees, side-channels and the necessary appurtenant works;the course of the rhine downstream of the iffezheim barrage with a view to preventing or remedying erosion of the river-bed and the related lowering of the water-level of the rhine and ensuring in that sector conditions for navigation at least equivalent, as regards the depth of the channel, to those which will be attained as a result of the development of the rhine between lauterbourg/neuburgweier and sankt goar.2. the technical characteristics of the works at the two barrages are specified in annex i to this convention.3. as regards the development of the rhine downstream of the iffezheim barrage, the contracting parties envisage the progressive paving of the bed of the rhine and supplementary measures to deepen the navigable channel.they shall jointly study the technical feasibility of such measures.if the studies on the paving of the river-bed indicate that the desired objectives cannot be attained, the contracting parties shall agree on other appropriate measures.in each case, the technical characteristics of the necessary works shall be subsequently specified in a separate agreement ARTICLE 2conditions for the development1. the development defined in article i of this convention shall be carried out in such a way as not to cause, in the area of
