Each Party shall accord immediately and unconditionally to products originating in or exported to the territory of the other Party treatment no less favorable than that accorded to like products originating in or exported to the territory of any third country in all matters relating to: A. customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation or exportation, including the method oflevying such duties and charges; B. methods of payment for imports and exports, and the international transfer of such payments; C. rules and formalitiesinconnectionwith importation and exportation, including those relating to customs clearance, transit, warehouses and transshipment; D. taxes and otherinternal charges of any kind applied directly or indirectly to imported products; E. laws, regulations and other requirements affecting the sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution, storage and use of products in the domestic market; and F. the application of quantitative restrictions and the granting of licenses. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to action by a Party which is consistent with such Party’s obligations under the World Trade Organization and the agreements administered thereby. A Party shall nonetheless extend to the products originating in the territory of the other Party most-favored nation treatment in respect of any tariff reductions resulting from multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization provided such Party accords such benefits to all other WTO members. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to: -3- A. advantages accorded by either Party by virtue of such Party's full membership in a customs union or free trade area, and B. advantages accorded to third countries for the facilitation of frontier traffic. 4.

Each Party shall administer tariff and nontariff measures affecting trade in a manner which affords meaningful competitive opportunities for products of the other Party with respect to domestic competitors. 2. Accordingly, neither Party shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of the other Party imported into its territory, internal taxes or charges of any kind in excess of those applied, directly or indirectly, to like domestic products. 3. Each Party shall accord to products originating in the territory of the other Party treatment no less favorable than that accorded to like domestic products in respect of all laws, regulations and other requirements affecting their internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution, storage or use. 4. In addition to the obligations of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the charges and measures described in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall not otherwise be applied to imported or domestic products so as to afford protection to domestic production. 5. The obligations of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article shall be subject to the exceptionsset forth in Article III of GATT 1994 and Annex A to this Agreement. 6. Consistent with the provisions of GATT 1994, the Parties shall ensure that technical regulations and standards are not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to creating obstaclesto international trade or to protect domestic production.

Accordingly, the Parties shall: A. ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary measure which is not inconsistent with the provisions of the GATT 1994, is applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, is based on scientific principles and is not -4- maintained without sufficient evidence (i.e., a risk assessment), taking into account the availabilityofrelevantscientific information and regional conditions,such as pest free zones; B. ensure that technical regulations are not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade. For this purpose, technical regulationsshall not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking into account the risks non- fulfillment would create. Such legitimate objectives include national security requirements; the prevention of deceptive practices; protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or the environment. In assessing such risks, relevant elements of consideration include available scientific and technical information, related processing technology or intended end- uses of products. 7.

The Parties shall, within two years of the entry into force of this Agreement, adopt a system of customs valuation based on the transaction value of the imported merchandise on which duty is assessed, or of like merchandise, rather than on the value of merchandise of national origin or on arbitrary or fictitious values, with the transaction value being the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation in accordance with the standards established in the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the GATT 1994; and 5.

The Parties agree to consult promptly at the request of either Party whenever either actual or prospective imports of products originating in the territory of the other Party cause or threaten to cause or significantly contribute to market disruption. Market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry. The consultations provided in this paragraph shall have the objectives of (a) presenting and examining the factors relating to such imports that may be causing or threatening to cause orsignificantlycontributing to market disruption, and (b)findingmeans of preventing or remedying such market disruption. Such consultations shall be concluded within sixty daysfrom the date of the requestforsuch consultations, unlessthe Parties agree otherwise. 2.

However, where the law of a Party allows for use of the subject matter of a patent, other than use allowed under paragraph 4, without the authorization of the right holder, including use by the government or other persons authorized by the government, the Party shall respect the following provisions: A. authorization of such use shall be considered on its individual merits; B. such use may be permitted only if, prior to such use, the proposed user has made effortsto obtain authorization fromthe right holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions and such efforts have not been successful within a reasonable period of time. The requirement to make such efforts may be waived by a Party in the case of a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. In situations of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, the right holder shall, nevertheless, be notified assoon asreasonably practicable. In the case of public non-commercial use, where the government or contractor, without making a patent search, knows or has demonstrable grounds to know that a valid patent is or will be used by or for the government, the right holder shall be informed promptly; C. the scope and duration of such use shall be limited to the purpose for which it was authorized, and in the case of semiconductor technology shall only be for public non-commercial use or to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive; D. such use shall be non-exclusive; E. such use shall be non-assignable, except with that part of the enterprise or goodwill that enjoys such use; F. any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the Party's domestic market; G. authorization for such use shall be liable, subject to adequate protection of the legitimate interests of the persons so authorized, to be terminated if and when the circumstances that led to it cease to exist and are unlikely to recur. The competent authority shall have the authority to review, on petition of an interested party, the continued existence of these circumstances; -20- H. the right holder shall be paid adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case, taking into account the economic value of the authorization; I. the legal validity of any decision relating to the authorization shall be subject to judicial or other independent review by a distinct higher authority; J. any decision relating to the remuneration provided in respect of such use shall be subject to judicial or other independent review by a distinct higher authority; K. the Party shall not be obliged to apply the conditionsset out in subparagraphs B and F of this Article where such use is permitted to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anticompetitive. The need to correct anticompetitive practices may be taken into account in determining the amount of remuneration in such cases. Competent authorities shall have the authority to refuse termination of authorization if and when the conditions that led to such authorization are likely to recur; and L. the Party shall not authorize the use of the subject matter of a patent to permit the exploitation of another patent except as a remedy for an adjudicated violation of domestic laws regarding anticompetitive practices. 9. Where the subject matter of a patent is a process for obtaining a product, each Party shall, in any infringement proceeding, place on the defendant the burden of establishing that the allegedly infringing product was made by a process other than the patented process in one or more of the following situations: A. the product obtained by the patented process is new; or B. a substantial likelihood exists that the allegedly infringing product was made by the process and the patent owner has been unable through reasonable efforts to determine the process actually used. In the gathering and evaluation of evidence, the legitimate interests of the defendant in protecting its trade secrets shall be taken into account. 10. Each Party shall provide a term of protection for patents that shall not end before the expiration of a period of twenty years counted from the date of filing.

Neither Party may make unlawful any of the acts referred to in paragraph 2 performed in respect of an integrated circuit that incorporates an unlawfully reproduced layout design, or any article that incorporates such an integrated circuit, where the person performing those acts or ordering those acts to be done did not know and had no reasonable ground to know, when it acquired the integrated circuit or article incorporating such an integrated circuit, that it incorporated an unlawfully reproduced layout design. 4. Each Party shall provide that, after the person referred to in paragraph 3 has received sufficient notice that the layout designwas unlawfully reproduced,such person may perform any of the acts with respect to the stock on hand or ordered before such notice, but shall be liable to pay the right holder for doing so an amount equivalent to a reasonable royalty such as would be payable under a freely negotiated license in respect of such a layout design. 5. Neither Party may permit the compulsory licensing of layout designs of integrated circuits. 6. Any Party that requires registration as a condition for protection of a layout design shall provide that the term of protection shall not end before the expiration of a period of 10 years counted from the date of filing an application for registration or from the date on which the layout design isfirst commercially exploited in the world, whichever occurs first. 7. Where a Party does not require registration as a condition for protection of a layout design, the Party shall provide a term of protection of not less than 10 years from the date of the first commercial exploitation of the layout design, wherever in the world it occurs. 8. Notwithstanding paragraphs 6 and 7, a Party may provide that the protection shall lapse 15 years after the creation of the layout design. -22- Article 9 Confidential Information (Trade Secrets) 1.

With respect to the authority referred to in subparagraph 2.D, a Party shall, at least with respect to works protected by copyright or neighboring rights, provide judicial authorities with the authority to order the payment of pre-established damages. Judicial authorities shall exercise such authority at their discretion. -26- 4. Each Party shall, in order to create an effective deterrent to infringement and counterfeiting, authorize its judicial authorities to order that: A. goods that they have found to be infringing be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any injury caused to the right holder or, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements, destroyed; and B. materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the creation of the infringing goods be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements. In considering whether to issue such an order, judicial authorities shall take into account the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered, as well asthe interests of other persons. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit release of the goods into the channels of commerce. 5. In respect of the administration of any law pertaining to the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party may exempt public authorities and officials from liability, unless their actions were not taken or intended in good faith in the course of the administration of such laws. 6.

Each Party shall provide that, where a provisional measure can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Article. Article 14 Criminal Procedures and Penalties 1. Each Party shall provide criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or infringement of copyrights or neighboring rights on a commercial scale.

No Party shall be obligated to apply such procedures to goods in transit. A Party may permit such an application to be made in respect of goods that involve other infringements of intellectual property rights, provided that the requirements of this Article are met. A Party may also provide for corresponding procedures concerning the suspension by the customs administration of the release of infringing goods destined for exportation from its territory. 2. Each Party shall require any applicant who initiates procedures under paragraph 1 to provide adequate evidence: A. to satisfy that Party's competent authorities that, under its domestic laws, there is prima facie an infringement of its intellectual property right; and B. to supply a sufficiently detailed description of the goods to make them readily recognizable by the customs administration.

Each Party shall authorize its competent authoritiesto require an applicant under paragraph 1 to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. 4. A Party's customs administration, upon receiving an application pursuant to procedures adopted in accordance with this Article, may suspend the release of goods involving industrial designs, patents, integrated circuits or trade secrets into free circulation on the basis of a decision other than by a judicial or other independent authority; provided, however, if the period set forth in paragraphs 6 through 8 has expired without the granting of provisionalrelief by the duly empowered authority, and provided that all other conditions for importation have been complied with, such Party shall permit the owner, importer or consignee of such goods to receive such goods for entry into commerce on the posting of a security in an amount sufficient to protect the right holder against any infringement. Payment of such security shall not prejudice any other remedy available to the right holder, -30- it being understood that the security shall be released if the right holder fails to pursue its right of action within a reasonable period of time. 5. Each Party shall ensure that its customs administration will promptly notify the importer and the applicant when the customs administration suspends the release of goods pursuant to paragraph 1. 6. Each Party shall ensure that its customs administration will release goods from suspension if within a period not exceeding 10 working days after the applicant under paragraph 1 has been served notice of the suspension the customs administration has not been informed that: A. a party other than the defendant has initiated proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case, or B. a competent authority has taken provisional measures prolonging the suspension, provided that all other conditions for importation or exportation have been met. Each Party shall provide that, in appropriate cases, the customs administration may extend the suspension by another 10 working days. 7.

Each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities have the authority to order the applicant under paragraph 1 to pay the importer, the consignee and the owner of the goods appropriate compensation for any injury caused to them through the wrongful detention of goods or through the detention of goods released pursuant to paragraph 6. 10. Without prejudice to the protection of confidential information, each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities have the authority to give the right holder sufficient opportunity to have any goods detained by the customs administration inspected in order to substantiate its claims. Each Party shall also ensure that its competent authorities have the authority to give the importer an equivalent opportunity to have any such goods inspected. Where the competent authorities have made a positive determination on the merits of a case, a Party may provide the competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. -31- 11. Where a Party requires its competent authorities to act on their own initiative and to suspend the release of goods in respect of which they have acquired prima facie evidence that an intellectual property right is being infringed: A. The competent authorities may at any time seek from the right holder any information that might assist them to exercise these powers; B. the importer and the right holdershall be promptly notified of the suspension by the Party’s competent authorities, and where the importer lodges an appeal against the suspension with competent authorities, the suspension shall be subject to the conditions, with such modifications as may be necessary, set out in paragraphs 6 through 8; and C. the Party may exempt public authorities and officialsfrom liability, except when the offending actions were not taken or intended in good faith. 12.

A Party may exclude from the application of paragraphs 1 through 12 small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travelers’ personal luggage or sent in small consignments that are not repetitive. Article 16 Existing Subject Matter To the extent this Agreement requires a Party to increase its level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, it gives rise to obligations in respect of all subject matter existing at the date of application of this Agreement for the Party in question, and which is protected in that Party on the date the Agreement enters into force, or which meets or comes subsequently to meet the criteria for protection under the terms of this Agreement. In respect of this Article, copyright obligations with respect to existing works shall be solely determined under Article 18 of the Berne Convention (1971), and obligations with respect to the rights of producers of phonograms and performers in existing phonograms shall be determined solely under Article 18 of the Berne Convention (1971), which is applied with such modifications as may be necessary. -32- Article 17 Technical Cooperation 1.

To this end, the United States agrees to provide Vietnam with technical assistance to strengthen its regime for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Such technical assistance shall be provided on mutually agreed terms and is subject to the availability of appropriated funds. This assistance may be provided through, or in conjunction with, private industry or international organizations. 2.

"services" includes any service in any sector except servicessupplied in the exercise of governmental authority; C. "a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority" means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers. 2 This condition is understood in terms of number of sectors, volume of trade affected and modes of supply. In order to meet this condition, agreements should not provide for the a priori exclusion of any mode of supply. -35- Article 2 Most-Favored-Nation Treatment 1. With respect to any measure covered by this Chapter, each Party shall accord immediately and unconditionally to services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like services and service suppliers of any other country. 2. A Party maymaintain a measure inconsistent with paragraph 1 provided thatsuch a measure is listed in Listing of Article 2 Exemptions in Annex G. 3. The provisions of this Chapter shall not be so construed as to prevent either Party from conferring or according advantages to adjacent countries in order to facilitate exchanges limited to contiguous frontier zones of services that are both locally produced and consumed. Article 3 Economic Integration 1. This Chapter shall not apply to advantages accorded by either Party by virtue of such Party’s membership in, or having entered into, an agreement liberalizing trade in services between or among the parties to such an agreement, provided that such an agreement: A. has substantial sectoral coverage,2 and B. provides for the absence or elimination of substantially all discrimination, in the sense of Article 7, between or among the parties, in the sectors covered under subparagraph (A), through: i) elimination of existing discriminatory measures, and/or ii) prohibition of new or more discriminatory measures, either at the entry into force of that agreement or on the basis of a reasonable timeframe, except for measures permitted under Articles 1, 2, and 3 of Chapter VII. 2.

In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner. 2. A. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service supplier, forthe promptreview of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services. Where such procedures are not independent ofthe agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review. B. The provisions of subparagraph A shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system. 3. Where authorization isrequired for the supply of a service on which a specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of a Party shall, within a reasonable period oftime after the submission of an application considered complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application. At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application. 4. A.
