UNILATERAL DECLARATION BY CENTRAL AMERICA CONCERNING THE SPECIAL CONCESSIONS GRANTED TO CENTRAL AMERICA UNDER COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3900/91 OF 16 DECEMBER 1991

Central America stresses the priority it attaches to the preferential treatment accorded it by the European Community in the context of the generalised system of preferences.

This treatment is of special importance to Central America in supporting the peace process, the consolidation of democracy and national reconstruction in the region, and also the efforts being made to ensure that the Central American countries' fragile economies, their societies and democratic institutions remain unaffected by drug-related problems.
