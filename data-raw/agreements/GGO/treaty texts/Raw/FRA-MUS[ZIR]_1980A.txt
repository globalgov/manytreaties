Analysis
The France (Reunion) - Mauritius maritime boundary is depicted on the attached illustrative page-size map which is
based on DMAHTC chart No. 702. An official map was attached to the treaty as Annex II. Measurements used in this study are
based on charts and parameters different from those utilized by the Parties. Thus, any comparative measurements may differ
slightly from those found in this study and on the attached table, in particular.
The boundary which, according to the treaty, separates the respective economic zones of the islands consists of seven
turning and terminal points and runs in a northwesterly-southeasterly direction. The boundary runs between the similarly shaped
and sized islands of Reunion and Mauritius and traverses relatively deep water (3300-5000 meters in depth) in the southwestern
part of the Indian Ocean. In the northwest the boundary commences as a tripoint approximately 153 nautical miles seaward of
Reunion, Mauritius and the island of Tromelin (an unassociated French island which is administered from Reunion).
The boundary comes nearest to Reunion and Mauritius at turning point 4 as the two islands are located approximately 95
nautical miles distant from each other at this point. The line continues to the southeast until reaching a point 200 nautical miles
from each island (P7 on the map). The total length of the boundary is 364.8 nautical miles. The boundary is a median line since,
as noted in the treaty, the two countries agreed that in this particular situation the equidistant method constituted "an equitable
system of delimitation". The distance between boundary turning points and between the turning points and the nearest territories
are listed in the attached table.
