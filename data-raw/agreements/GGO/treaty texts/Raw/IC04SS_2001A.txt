international convention on the control of harmful anti-fouling systems on shipssource: the parties to this convention,noting that scientific studies and investigations by governments and competent international organizations have shown that certain anti-fouling systems used on ships pose a substantial risk of toxicity and other chronic impacts to ecologically and economically important marine organisms and also that human health may be harmed as a result of the consumption of affected seafood,noting in particular the serious concern regarding anti-fouling systems that use organotin compounds as biocides and being convinced that the introduction of such organotins into the environment must be phased-out,recalling that chapter 17 of agenda 21 adopted by the united nations conference on environment and development, 1992, calls upon states to take measures to reduce pollution caused by organotin compounds used in anti-fouling systems,recalling also that resolution a.895(21), adopted by the assembly of the international maritime organization on 25 november 1999, urges the organization's marine environment protection committee (mepc) to work towards the expeditious development of a global legally binding instrument to address the harmful effects of anti-fouling systems as a matter of urgency,mindful of the precautionary approach set out in principle 15 of the rio declaration on environment and development and referred to in resolution mepc.67(37) adopted by mepc on 15 september 1995,recognizing the importance of protecting the marine environment and human health from adverse effects of anti-fouling systems,recognizing also that the use of anti-fouling systems to prevent the build-up of organisms on the surface of ships is of critical importance to efficient commerce, shipping and impeding the spread of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens,recognizing further the need to continue to develop anti-fouling systems which are effective and environmentally safe and to promote the substitution of harmful systems by less harmful systems or preferably harmless systems,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1general obligations(1) each party to this convention undertakes to give full and complete effect to its provisions in order to reduce or eliminate adverse effects on the marine environment and human health caused by anti-fouling systems.(2) the annexes form an integral part of this convention. unless expressly provided otherwise, a reference to this convention constitutes at the same time a reference to its

effective measures to ensure that such ships comply with those requirements.(2) ships bearing an anti-fouling system which is controlled through an amendment to annex 1 following entry into force of this convention may retain that system until the next scheduled renewal of that system, but in no event for a period exceeding 60 months following application, unless the committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist to warrant earlier implementation of the control ARTICLE 5controls of annex 1 waste materialstaking into account international rules, standards and requirements, a party shall take appropriate measures in its territory to require that wastes from the application or removal of an anti-fouling system controlled in annex 1 are collected, handled, treated and disposed of in a safe and environmentally sound manner to protect human health and the environment ARTICLE 6process for proposing amendments to controls on anti-fouling systems(1) any party may propose an amendment to annex 1 in accordance with this article.(2) an initial proposal shall contain the information required in annex 2, and shall be submitted to the organization. when the

organizations having agreements with the organization and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the organization and shall make it available to them.(3) the committee shall decide whether the anti-fouling system in question warrants a more in-depth review based on the initial proposal. if the committee decides that further review is warranted, it shall require the proposing party to submit to the committee a comprehensive proposal containing the information required in annex 3, except where the initial proposal also includes all the information required in annex 3. where the committee is of the view that there is a threat of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason to prevent a decision to proceed with the evaluation of the proposal. the committee shall establish a technical group in accordance with article 7.(4) the technical group shall review the comprehensive proposal along with any additional data submitted by any interested entity and shall evaluate and report to the committee whether the proposal has demonstrated a potential for unreasonable risk of adverse effects on non-target organisms or human health such that the amendment of annex 1 is warranted. in this regard:(a) the technical group's review shall include:(i) an evaluation of the association between the anti-fouling system in question and the related adverse effects observed either in the environment or on human health, including, but not limited to, the consumption of affected seafood, or through controlled studies based on the data described in annex 3 and any other relevant data which come to light;(ii) an evaluation of the potential risk reduction attributable to the proposed control measures and any other control measures that may be considered by the technical group;(iii) consideration of available information on the technical feasibility of control measures and the cost-effectiveness of the proposal;(iv) consideration of available information on other effects from the introduction of such control measures relating to: - the environment (including, but not limited to, the cost of inaction and the impact on air quality);- shipyard health and safety concerns (i.e. effects on shipyard workers);- the cost to international shipping and other relevant sectors; and(v) consideration of the

evaluations and considerations referred to in subparagraph (a), except that the technical group may decide not to proceed with the evaluations and considerations described in subparagraph (a)(ii) through (a)(v) if it determines after the evaluation in subparagraph (a)(i) that the proposal does not warrant further consideration.(c) the technical group's report shall include, inter alia, a recommendation on whether international controls pursuant to this convention are warranted on the anti-fouling system in question, on the suitability of the specific control measures suggested in the comprehensive proposal, or on other control measures which it believes to be more suitable.(5) the technical group's report shall be circulated to the parties, members of the organization, the united nations and its specialized agencies, intergovernmental organizations having agreements with the organization and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the organization, prior to its consideration by the committee. the committee shall decide whether to approve any proposal to amend annex 1, and any modifications thereto, if appropriate, taking into account the technical group's report. if the report finds a threat of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not, itself, be used as a reason to prevent a decision from being taken to list an anti-fouling system in annex 1. the proposed amendments to annex 1, if approved by the committee, shall be circulated in accordance with article 16(2)(a). a decision not to approve the proposal shall not preclude future submission of a new proposal with respect to a particular anti-fouling system if new information comes to light.(6) only parties may participate in decisions taken by the committee described in paragraphs (3) and (5) ARTICLE 7technical groups(1) the committee shall establish a technical group pursuant to article 6 when a comprehensive proposal is received. in

certificationa party shall ensure that ships entitled to fly its flag or operating under its authority are surveyed and certified in accordance with the regulations in annex 4 ARTICLE 11inspections of ships and detection of violations(1) a ship to which this convention applies may, in any port, shipyard, or offshore terminal of a party, be inspected by officers authorized by that party for the purpose of determining whether the ship is in compliance with this convention. unless there are clear grounds for believing that a ship is in violation of this convention, any such inspection shall be limited to:(a) verifying that, where required, there is onboard a valid international anti-fouling system certificate or a declaration on anti-fouling system; and/or(b) a brief sampling of the ship's anti-fouling system that does not affect the integrity, structure, or operation of the anti-fouling system taking into account guidelines developed by the organization.* however, the time required to process the results of such sampling shall not be used as a basis for preventing the movement and departure of the ship.(2) if there are clear grounds to believe that the ship is in violation of this convention, a thorough inspection may be carried out taking into account guidelines developed by the organization.[1](3) if the ship is detected to be in violation of this convention, the party carrying out the inspection may take steps to warn, detain, dismiss, or exclude the ship from its ports. a party taking such action against a ship for the reason that the ship does not comply with this convention shall immediately inform the administration of the ship concerned.(4) parties shall co-operate in the detection of violations and the enforcement of this convention. a party may also inspect a ship when it enters the ports, shipyards, or offshore terminals under its jurisdiction, if a request for an investigation is received from any party, together with sufficient evidence that a

ship concerned so that the appropriate action may be taken under this convention ARTICLE 12violations(1) any violation of this convention shall be prohibited and sanctions shall be established therefor under the law of the administration of the ship concerned wherever the violation occurs. if the administration is informed of such a violation, it shall investigate the matter and may request the reporting party to furnish additional evidence of the alleged violation. if the administration is satisfied that sufficient evidence is available to enable proceedings to be brought in respect of the alleged violation, it shall cause such proceedings to be taken as soon as possible, in accordance with its laws. the administration shall promptly inform the party that reported the alleged violation, as well as the organization, of any action taken. if the administration has not taken any action within one year after receiving the information, it shall so inform the party which reported the alleged violation.(2) any violation of this convention within the jurisdiction of any party shall be prohibited and sanctions shall be established therefor under the law of that party. whenever such a violation occurs, that party shall either:(a) cause proceedings to be taken in accordance with its law; or(b) furnish to the administration of the ship concerned such information and evidence as may be in its possession that a violation has occurred.(3) the sanctions established under the laws of a party pursuant to this article shall be adequate in severity to discourage violations of this convention wherever they occur ARTICLE 13undue delay or detention of ships(1) all possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed under article 11 or 12.(2) when a ship is unduly detained or delayed under article 11 or 12, it shall be entitled to compensation for any loss or damage suffered ARTICLE 14dispute settlementparties shall settle any dispute between
