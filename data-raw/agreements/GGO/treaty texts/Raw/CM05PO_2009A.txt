convention on the conservation and management of high seas fishery resources in the south pacific oceansource: the contracting parties,committed to ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the south pacific ocean and in so doing safeguarding the marine ecosystems in which the resources occur;recalling relevant international law as reflected in the united nations convention on the law of the sea of 10 december 1982, the agreement for the implementation of the provisions of the united nations convention on the law of the sea of 10 december 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks of 4 december 1995 and the agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas of 24 november 1993 and taking into account the code of conduct for responsible fisheries adopted by the conference of the food and agriculture organisation of the united nations at its twenty eighth session on 31 october 1995;recognising that under international law reflected in the relevant provisions of the above agreements, states have a duty to cooperate with each other in the conservation and management of living resources in the areas of the high seas and, as appropriate, to cooperate to establish sub-regional or regional fisheries organisations or arrangements with a view to taking the measures necessary for the conservation of such resources;taking into consideration that, under international law reflected in the relevant provisions of the united nations convention on the law of the sea of 10 december 1982, coastal states have waters under national jurisdiction within which they exercise their sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing fishery resources and conserving living marine resources upon which fishing has an impact;recognising economic and geographical considerations and the special requirements of developing states, in particular the least-developed among them, and small island developing states, and territories and possessions, and their coastal communities, in relation to the conservation, management and sustainable development of fishery resources and equitable benefit from those resources;noting the need for regional fisheries management organisations and arrangements to undertake performance reviews in order to assess the degree to which they are attaining their respective conservation and management objectives;determined to cooperate effectively to eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the adverse impact that it has on the state of the world fishery resources and the ecosystems in which they occur; conscious of the need to avoid adverse impacts on the marine environment, preserve biodiversity, maintain the integrity of marine ecosystems and minimise the risk of long term or irreversible effects of fishing;mindful that effective conservation and management measures must be based on the best scientific information available and the application of the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries management;convinced that the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the south pacific ocean and the protection of the marine ecosystems in which those resources occur may

management of fishery resources are considered in the context of the functioning of the wider marine ecosystems in which they occur to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of those resources and in so doing, safeguard those marine ecosystems ARTICLE 4compatibility of conservation and management measures1 the contracting parties recognise the need to ensure compatibility of conservation and management measures established for fishery resources that are identified as straddling areas under the national jurisdiction of a coastal state contracting party and the adjacent high seas of the convention area and acknowledge their duty to cooperate to this end.2 conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of straddling fishery resources in their entirety. in developing compatible conservation and management measures for straddling fishery resources contracting parties shall:(a) take into account the biological unity and other biological characteristics of the fishery resources and the relationships between the distribution of the resources, the fishing activities for those resources and the geographical particularities of the region concerned, including the extent to which the fishery resources occur and are fished in areas under national jurisdiction;(b) take into account the respective dependence of the coastal states and the states fishing on the high seas on the fishery resources concerned; and(c) ensure that such measures do not result in harmful impact on the living marine resources as a whole in the convention area.3 the commission's initial conservation and management measures shall take due account of, and not undermine the effectiveness of, existing conservation and management measures established by relevant coastal state contracting parties in respect of areas under national jurisdiction and by contracting parties in respect of their flag vessels fishing in the adjacent high seas of the convention area ARTICLE 5area of application1 except as otherwise provided, this convention applies to waters of the pacific ocean beyond areas of national jurisdiction in accordance with international law:(a) east of a line extending south along the 120&#186; meridian of east longitude from the outer limit of the national jurisdiction of australia off the south coast of western australia to the intersection with the 55&#186; parallel of south latitude; then due east along

parties in the region, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing states, and of territories and possessions in the region, in relation to the conservation and management of fishery resources in the convention area and the sustainable use of such resources.2 in giving effect to the duty to cooperate in the establishment of conservation and management measures for fishery resources covered by this convention, the members of the commission shall take into account the special requirements of developing state contracting parties in the region, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing states, and territories and possessions in the region, in particular:(a) the vulnerability of such developing states and territories and possessions which are dependent on the exploitation of living marine resources, including for meeting the nutritional requirements of their populations or part thereof;(b) the need to avoid adverse impacts on, and ensure access to fisheries by, subsistence, small-scale and artisanal fishers and women fish workers, as well as indigenous people in such developing states parties, and territories and possessions; and(c) the need to ensure that such measures do not result in transferring, directly or indirectly, a disproportionate burden of conservation action onto such developing state contracting parties, and territories and possessions.3 the members of the commission shall cooperate either directly or through the commission and other regional or sub-regional organisations to:(a) enhance the ability of developing state contracting parties in the region, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing states, and of territories and possessions in the region, to conserve and manage fishery resources and to develop their own fisheries for such resources;(b) assist developing state contracting parties in the region, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing states, and territories and possessions in the region, to enable them to participate in fishing for fishery resources, including facilitating access to such fishery resources consistent with article 3 and article 21; and(c) facilitate the participation of developing state contracting parties in the region, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing states, and of territories and possessions in the region, in the work of the commission and its subsidiary bodies.4 cooperation for the purposes set out in this article may include the provision of financial assistance, assistance relating to human resources development, technical assistance, transfer of technology, including through joint venture arrangements, and advisory and consultative services. such assistance shall, inter alia, be directed towards:(a) improved conservation and management of fishery resources through collection, reporting, verification,

territories and possessions in the region, in the work of thecommission and its subsidiary bodies. the financial regulations of the commission shall include guidelines for the administration of the fund and criteria for eligibility for assistance ARTICLE 20conservation and management measures1 the conservation and management measures adopted by the commission shall include measures to:(a) ensure the long-term sustainability of fishery resources and promote the objective of their responsible utilisation;(b) prevent or eliminate over-fishing and excess fishing capacity to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources;(c) maintain or restore populations of non-target and associated or dependent species to above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened; and(d) protect the habitats and marine ecosystems in which fishery resources and non-target and associated or dependent species occur from the impacts of fishing, including measures to prevent significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems and precautionary measures where it cannot adequately be determined whether vulnerable marine ecosystems are present or whether fishing would cause significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems.2 the specific conservation and management measures adopted by the commission shall, as appropriate, include the determination of:(a) reference points, including precautionary reference points as described in annex ii of the 1995 agreement;(b) the actions to be taken if those reference points are approached or exceeded;(c) the nature and extent of fishing for any fishery resource including the establishment of a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort;(d) the general or specific locations in which fishing may or may not occur;(e) the periods in which fishing may or may not occur;(f) the size limits in respect of the catch which may be retained; and(g) the types of fishing gear, fishing technology, or fishing practices which may be used when fishing.3 in determining a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort for any fishery resource under paragraph 2 (c), the commission shall take into account the following factors:(a) the status and stage of development of the fishery resource;(b) fishing patterns of the fishery resource;(c) catch of the same fishery resource within areas under national jurisdiction where relevant;(d) an allowance for discards and any other incidental mortality;(e) catch of non-target and associated or dependent species and impacts on the marine ecosystems in which the fishery resource occurs;(f) relevant ecological and biological factors limiting the nature of fishery resources that may be harvested;(g) relevant environmental factors, including trophic interactions which may have an effect upon the fishery resource and non-target and associated or dependent species; and(h) as appropriate, relevant conservation and management measures adopted by other intergovernmental organisations.the commission shall regularly review the total allowable catch or total allowable fishing

parties:(i) the commission shall establish a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort and other conservation and management measures, as appropriate, for the convention area. the commission and the coastal state contracting party or parties concerned shall cooperate in the coordination of their respective conservation and management measures in accordance with article 4 of this convention;(ii) with the express consent of the coastal state contracting party or parties concerned, the commission may establish, in accordance with annex ill of this convention, and as appropriate, a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort that will apply throughout the range of the fishery resource; and(iii) in the case where one or more of the coastal state contracting parties does not consent to a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort that will apply throughout the range of the fishery resource, the commission may establish, as appropriate, a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort that will apply in the areas of national jurisdiction of the consenting coastal state contracting party or parties and the convention area ANNEX iii will apply, mutatis mutandis, to the establishment of this total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort by the commission.(b) in cases covered by subparagraph (a) (ii) or (a) (iii), other complementary conservation and management measures may be adopted so as to ensure sustainable conservation and management of the fishery resource throughout its range. to give effect to this paragraph, such measures may be adopted, in accordance with the principles of compatibility outlined in article 4, by the commission for the high seas and the coastal state contracting party or parties concerned for the areas under national jurisdiction; and by the commission, with the consent of the coastal state contracting party or parties concerned, for measures that will apply throughout the range of the fishery resource,(c) all conservation and management measures, including a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort, adopted by the commission in accordance with subparagraphs (a) (ii), (a) (iii) and (b) are without prejudice to and do not affect the sovereign rights of coastal states for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living marine resources within areas under national jurisdiction in accordance with international law, as reflected in the relevant provisions of the 1982 convention and the 1995 agreement, and do not in any other respect affect the area of application of this convention established by article 5.5(a) the commission shall adopt measures to be applied on an emergency basis, in accordance with article 16, including intersessionally, if necessary, where fishing presents a serious threat to the sustainability of fishery resources or the marine ecosystem in which these fishery resources occur or when a natural phenomenon or human caused disaster has, or is likely to have, a significant adverse impact on the status of fishery resources to ensure that fishing does not exacerbate such threat or adverse impact.(b) measures taken on an emergency basis shall be based on the best scientific evidence available. such measures shall be temporary and must be reconsidered for decision at the next meeting of the commission following their adoption. the measures shall become binding on the members of the commission in accordance with article 17 paragraph 1. such measures shall not be open to the objection procedure in article 17 paragraph 2 but may be the subject of dispute settlement procedures under this convention.6 the conservation and management measures adopted by the commission shall be progressively developed and integrated into management strategies or plans that set out the management objectives for each fishery resource, the reference points against which to measure progress in relation to those objectives, the indicators to be used in relation to those reference points and the measures to be taken in response to particular indicator levels ARTICLE 21participation in fishing for fishery resources1 when taking decisions regarding participation in fishing for any fishery resource, including the allocation of a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort, the commission shall take into account the status of the fishery resource and the existing level of fishing effort for that resource and the following criteria to the extent relevant:(a) historic catch and past and present fishing patterns and practices in the convention area;(b) compliance with the conservation and management measures under this convention;(c) demonstrated capacity and willingness to exercise effective flag state control over fishing vessels;(d) contribution to the conservation and management of fishery resources, including the provision of accurate data and effective monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement;(e) the fisheries development aspirations and interests of developing states in particular small island developing states and of territories and possessions in the region;(f) the interests of coastal states, and in particular developing coastal states and territories and possessions, in a fishery resource that straddles areas of national jurisdiction of such states, territories and possessions and the convention area;(g) the needs of coastal states and of territories and possessions whose economies are dependent mainly on the exploitation of and fishing for a fishery resource that straddles areas of national jurisdiction of such states, territories and possessions and the convention area;(h) the extent to which a member of the commission is utilising the catch for domestic consumption and the importance of the catch to its food security;(i) contribution to the responsible development of new or exploratory fisheries in accordance with article 22; and(j) contribution to the conduct of scientific research with respect to fishery resources and the public dissemination of the results of such research.2 when the commission establishes a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort for any fishery resource pursuant to article 20 paragraph 4 (a) (ii) or (iii), it may, with the express consent of the coastal state contracting party or parties concerned, also take decisions regarding participation in fishing for that resource throughout its relevant range.3 in taking decisions under paragraph 2, the commission shall take into account the historic catch and past and present fishing patterns and practices throughout the relevant range of the fishery resource concerned and the criteria listed in paragraph 1(b) (j).4 when the consent of the coastal state contracting party or parties concerned is not provided pursuant to paragraph 2:(a) the commission shall take decisions, in accordance with paragraph 1, regarding allocation of the portion of the total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort established pursuant to article 20 paragraph 4 (a) (i) that may be taken in the convention area; and(b) the commission and the coastal state contracting party or parties concerned shall cooperate in accordance with article 4.5 in taking decisions under this article, the commission may also have regard, as appropriate, to performance with respect to other international fisheries management regimes.6 the commission shall, when appropriate, review decisions regarding participation in fishing for fishery resources, including the allocation of a total allowable catch or total allowable fishing effort, taking into account the provisions of this article and the interests of new contracting parties ARTICLE 22new or exploratory fisheries1 a fishery that has not been subject to fishing or has not been subject to fishing with a particular gear type or technique for ten years or more shall be opened as a fishery or opened to fishing with such gear type or technique only when the commission has adopted cautious preliminary conservation and management measures in respect of that fishery, and, as appropriate, non-target and associated or dependent species, and appropriate measures to protect the marine ecosystem in which that fishery occurs from adverse impacts of fishing activities.2 such preliminary conservation and management measures, which may include requirements regarding notification of intention to fish, the establishment of a development plan, mitigation measures to prevent adverse impacts on marine ecosystems, use of particular fishing gear, the presence of observers, the collection of data, and the conduct of research or exploratory fishing, shall be consistent with the objective and the conservation and management principles and approaches of this convention. the measures shall ensure that the new fishery resource is developed on a precautionary and gradual basis until sufficient information is acquired to enable the commission to adopt appropriately detailed conservation and management measures.3 the commission may, from time to time, adopt standard minimum conservation and management measures that are to apply in respect of some or all new fisheries prior to the commencement of fishing for such new fisheries ARTICLE 23data collection, compilation and exchange1 to enhance the information base for the conservation and management of fishery resources, non-target and associated or dependent species and the protection of the marine ecosystems in which those resources occur; and to contribute to the elimination or reduction of iuu fishing and its negative impact on those resources, the commission shall, taking full account of annex i of the 1995 agreement, develop standards, rules and procedures for, inter a/ia:(a) the collection, verification and timely reporting to the commission of all relevant data by

ensure that penalties applicable for such violations are of an appropriate severity, taking into account relevant factors including the value of the catch, to secure compliance, discourage further violations and deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities; and(e) ensure in particular that, where it has been established, in accordance with its laws, that a fishing vessel flying its flag has been involved in the commission of a serious violation of the provisions of this convention or of any conservation and management measures adopted by the commission, the vessel concerned ceases fishing activities and does not engage in such activities in the convention area until it has complied with all outstanding sanctions imposed by the member of the commission in respect of the violation.4 each member of the commission is encouraged to ensure that fishing vessels flying its flag operate in the convention area in accordance with applicable international obligations, and with regard to relevant recommendations and guidelines, regarding safety at sea for vessels and their crews.5 each member of the commission shall ensure that fishing vessels flying its flag engaged in or intending to engage in research into fishery resources comply with any procedures established by the commission for the conduct of scientific research in the convention area ARTICLE 26port state duties1 a port state contracting party has the right and duty to take measures, in accordance with international law, to promote the effectiveness of sub-regional, regional and global conservation and management measures. when taking such measures, a port state contracting party shall not discriminate in form or in fact against the fishing vessels of any state.2 each member of the commission shall:(a) give effect to conservation and management measures adopted by the commission in relation to the entry and use of its ports by fishing vessels that have engaged in fishing in the convention area including, inter alia, with respect to landing and transhipment of fishery resources, inspection of fishing vessels, documents, catch and gear on board, and use of port services; and(b) provide assistance to flag states, as reasonably practical and in accordance with its national law and international law, when a fishing vessel is voluntarily in its ports and the flag state of the vessel requests it to provide assistance in ensuring compliance with the provisions of this convention and with the conservation and management measures adopted by the commission.3 in the event that a member of the commission considers that a fishing vessel making use of its ports has violated a provision of this convention or a conservation and management measure adopted by the commission, it shall notify the flag state concerned, the commission and other relevant states and appropriate international organisations. the member of the commission shall provide the flag state and, as appropriate the commission with full documentation on the matter, including any record of inspection.4 nothing in this article affects the exercise by contracting parties of their sovereignty over ports in their territory in accordance with international law ARTICLE 27monitoring, compliance and enforcement1 the commission shall establish appropriate cooperative procedures for effective monitoring, control and surveillance of fishing and to ensure compliance with this convention and the conservation and management measures adopted by the commission including, inter alia:(a) the establishment and maintenance of a commission record of vessels authorised to fish in the convention area, the marking of vessels and fishing gear, the recording of fishing activities, and the

deter and eliminate iuu fishing including, where appropriate, catch documentation schemes;(e) reporting on violations detected, progress and outcomes of investigations, and enforcement actions taken; and(f) addressing iuu fishing activities, including by identifying vessels engaging in iuu fishing activities, and by adopting appropriate measures to prevent, deter and eliminate iuu fishing, such as the development of an iuu vessels list, so that owners and operators of vessels engaging in such activities are deprived of the benefits accruing from those activities.2 the commission may adopt procedures that enable measures, including trade-related measures in relation to fishery resources, to be applied by members of the commission to any state, member of the commission, or entity whose fishing vessels engage in fishing activities that diminish the effectiveness of, or otherwise fail to comply with, the conservation and management measures adopted by the commission. such measures should include a range of possible responses so that account can be taken of the reason for and degree of non-compliance and should include, as appropriate, cooperative capacity-building initiatives. any implementation of trade-related measures by a member of the commission shall be consistent with that member's international obligations, including its obligations under the agreement establishing the world trade organisation.3 if, within three years of the entry into force of this convention, the commission has not adopted at sea inspection procedures as outlined in paragraph 1 (b), or an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligations of the members of the commission under the 1995 agreement and this convention to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures adopted by the commission, articles 21 and 22 of the 1995 agreement shall apply among contracting parties as if those articles were part of this agreement, and boarding and
