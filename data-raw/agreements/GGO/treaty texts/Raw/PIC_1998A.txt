iicriteria for listing banned or severely restricted chemicalsin annex iiiin reviewing the notifications forwarded by the secretariat pursuant to paragraph 5 of article 5, the chemical review committee shall:(a) confirm that the final regulatory action has been taken in order to protect human health or the environment;(b) establish that the final regulatory action has been taken as a consequence of a risk evaluation. this evaluation shall be based on a review of scientific data in the context of the conditions prevailing in the party in question. for this purpose, the documentation provided shall demonstrate that:(i) data have been generated according to scientifically recognized methods;(ii) data reviews have been performed and documented according to generally recognized scientific principles and procedures;(iii) the final regulatory action was based on a risk evaluation involving prevailing conditions within the party taking the action;(c) consider whether the final regulatory action provides a sufficiently broad basis to merit listing of the chemical in annex iii, by taking into account:(i) whether the final regulatory action led, or would be expected to lead, to a significant decrease in the quantity of the chemical used or the number of its uses;(ii) whether the final regulatory action led to an actual reduction of risk or would be expected to result in a significant reduction of risk for human health or the environment of the party that submitted the notification;(iii) whether the considerations that led to the final regulatory action being taken are applicable only in a limited geographical area or in other limited circumstances;(iv) whether there is evidence of ongoing international trade in the chemical;(d) take into account that intentional misuse is not in itself an adequate reason to list a chemical in annex iii ANNEX iiichemicals subject to the prior informed consent procedurechemicalrelevant cas
