Notice of Planned Procurement

Each Party shall encourage its procuring entities to publish, prior to each fiscal year or as early as possible in each fiscal year, a notice regarding their procurement plans for that fiscal year. The notice should include the subject-matter of the procurement and the planned date of the publication of the notice of the intended procurement.
ARTICLE 9.7: CONDITIONS FOR PARTICIPATION
A procuring entity shall limit any conditions for participation in a procurement to those that are essential to ensure that a supplier has the legal, commercial, technical, and financial abilities to undertake the relevant procurement.

In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for participation, a procuring entity:

shall evaluate the financial, commercial and technical abilities of a supplier on the basis of that supplier’s business activities both inside and outside the territory of the Party of the procuring entity;

shall base its evaluation solely on the conditions that a procuring entity has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation;

shall not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement or be awarded a contract, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of that Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of that Party; and

may require prior experience where essential to meet the requirements of the procurement.

Where there is supporting evidence, a Party, including its procuring entities, may exclude a supplier on grounds such as:

bankruptcy;

false declarations;

significant or persistent deficiencies in performance of any substantive requirement or obligation under a prior contract or contracts;

final judgments in respect of serious crimes or other serious offences;

professional misconduct or acts or omissions that adversely reflect on the commercial integrity of the supplier; or

failure to pay taxes.
ARTICLE 9.8: REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION OF SUPPLIERS

Registration Systems and Qualification Procedures
A Party, including its procuring entities, may maintain a supplier registration system under which interested suppliers are required to register and provide certain information.

Each Party shall ensure that:

its procuring entities make efforts to minimize differences in their qualification procedures; and

where its procuring entities maintain registration systems, the entities make efforts to minimize differences in their registration systems.

A Party, including its procuring entities, shall not adopt or apply any registration system or qualification procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to the participation of suppliers of the other Party in its procurement.

Selective Tendering

Where a Party’s law allows the use of selective tendering procedures, a procuring entity shall, for each intended procurement:

include in the notice of intended procurement at least the information specified in Article 9.6.3 subparagraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i) and (j) and invite suppliers to submit a request for participation; and

provide, by the commencement of the time-period for tendering, at least the information in Article 9.6.3 subparagraphs (c), and (f) regarding the qualified suppliers that it notifies as specified in Articles 9.9.3(b).

A procuring entity shall allow all qualified suppliers to participate in a particular procurement, unless the procuring entity states in the notice of intended procurement any limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender and the criteria for selecting the limited number of suppliers.

Where the tender documentation is not made publicly available from the date of publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 4, a procuring entity shall ensure that those documents are made available at the same time to all the qualified suppliers selected in accordance with paragraph 5.

Multi-Use Lists

A procuring entity may establish a multi-use list, provided that the entity annually publishes or otherwise makes available continuously in electronic form a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list. The notice shall include:

a description of the goods and services, or categories thereof, for which the list may be used;

the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers for inclusion on the list and the methods that the procuring entity will use to verify a supplier’s satisfaction of the conditions;

the name and address of the procuring entity and other information necessary to contact the entity and obtain all relevant documents relating to the list;

the period of validity of the list and the means for its renewal or termination, or where the period of validity is not provided, an indication of the method by which notice will be given of the termination of use of the list; and

an indication that the list may be used for procurement covered by this Chapter.

A procuring entity shall allow suppliers to apply for inclusion on a multi-use list and shall include on the list all qualified suppliers within a reasonably short time.

Notwithstanding paragraph 7, where a multi-use list will be valid for three years or less, a procuring entity may publish the notice referred to in paragraph 7 only once, at the beginning of the period of validity of the list, provided that the notice:

states the period of validity and that further notices will not be published; and

is published by electronic means and is made available continuously during the period of its validity.
ARTICLE 9.9: TIME LIMITS
A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time for suppliers to prepare and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders, taking into account such factors as:

the nature and complexity of the procurement;

the extent of subcontracting anticipated; and

whether tenders can be received by electronic means.

Such time-periods, including any extension of the time-periods, shall be the same for all interested or participating suppliers.

A procuring entity that uses selective tendering shall establish that the final date for the submission of requests for participation shall not, in principle, be less than 15 days from the date of publication of the notice of intended procurement. Where a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders this time-period impracticable, the time-period may be reduced to not less than 10 days.

Except as provided for in paragraphs 4 and 5, a procuring entity shall establish that the final date for the submission of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date on which:

in the case of open tendering, the notice of intended procurement is published; or

in the case of selective tendering, the entity notifies suppliers that they will be invited to submit tenders whether or not it uses a multi-use list.

A procuring entity may reduce the time-period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to not less than 10 days where:

the procuring entity has published a notice in an electronic medium listed in Annex 9-B, containing the information specified in Article 9.6.3 at least 40 days and not more than 12 months in advance;

in the case of the second or subsequent publication of notices for procurement of a recurring nature; or

a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders such timeperiod impracticable.

A procuring entity may reduce the time-period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 by five days for each one of the following circumstances:

the notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means;

all the tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement; and

the tenders can be received by electronic means by the procuring entity.

The use of paragraph 5, in conjunction with paragraph 4, shall in no case result in the reduction of the time-period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to less than 10 days from the date on which the notice of intended procurement is published.

Notwithstanding any other time-period in this Article, where a procuring entity purchases commercial goods or services, it may reduce the time-period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to not less than 13 days, provided that it publishes by electronic means, at the same time, both the notice of intended procurement and the tender documentation. Where the entity also accepts tenders for commercial goods and services by electronic means, it may reduce the time-period set out in paragraph 3 to not less than 10 days.

Where a procuring entity in Sections B or C of Annex 9-A has selected all or a limited number of qualified suppliers, the time-period for tendering may be fixed by mutual agreement between the procuring entity and the selected suppliers. In the absence of agreement, the period shall not be less than 10 days.
ARTICLE 9.10: INFORMATION ON INTENDED PROCUREMENTS

Tender Documentation
A procuring entity shall promptly make available to any supplier interested in participating in a procurement tender documentation that includes all information necessary to permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders.

Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall include a complete description of:

the procurement, including the nature and the quantity of the goods or services to be procured or, where the quantity is not known, the estimated quantity and any requirements to be fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity assessment certification, plans, drawings or instructional materials;

any conditions for participation of suppliers, including any financial guarantees, information, and documents that suppliers are required to submit;

all evaluation criteria to be considered in the awarding of the contract, and, except where price is the sole criterion, the relative importance of such criteria;

where the procuring entity will conduct the procurement by electronic means, any authentication and encryption requirements or other requirements related to the submission of information by electronic means;

where the procuring entity will hold an electronic auction, the rules, including identification of the elements of the tender related to the evaluation criteria, on which the auction will be conducted;

where there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time, and place for the opening of tenders, where appropriate, the persons authorized to be present;

any other terms or conditions, including terms of payment and any limitation on the means by which tenders may be submitted, e.g., paper or electronic means; and

any dates for the delivery of goods or the supply of services.

A procuring entity shall promptly reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by any interested or participating supplier, provided that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over other suppliers.

If, in tendering procedures, an entity allows tenders to be submitted in several languages, one of those languages shall be English.

Technical Specifications

A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade between the Parties.

In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or services being procured, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate:

specify the technical specification in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and

base the technical specification on international standards, where such exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognized national standards or building codes.

Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the technical specifications, a procuring entity shall indicate, where appropriate, that it will consider tenders of equivalent goods or services that demonstrably fulfill the requirements of the procurement by including words such as "or equivalent" in the tender documentation.

A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in such cases, the entity includes words such as "or equivalent" in the tender documentation.

A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement.

For greater certainty, a procuring entity may, in accordance with this Article, prepare, adopt or apply technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or protect the environment.

Modifications

Where, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the criteria or technical requirements set out in a notice or tender documentation provided to participating suppliers, or amends or reissues a notice or tender documentation, it shall transmit in writing all such modifications or amended or re-issued notice or tender documentation:

to all the suppliers that are participating at the time the information is modified, if the identities of such suppliers are known, and, in all other cases, in the same manner that the original information was made available; and

in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and re-submit amended tenders, as appropriate.
ARTICLE 9.11: NEGOTIATION
A Party may provide for its procuring entities to conduct negotiations:

where the entity has indicated its intent to conduct negotiations in the notice of intended procurement as set forth in Articles 9.6.1 through 9.6.3; or

where it appears from the evaluation that no tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation.

A procuring entity shall:

ensure that any elimination of suppliers participating in negotiations is carried out in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation; and

where negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the remaining participating suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.
ARTICLE 9.12: LIMITED TENDERING
Provided that it does not use this provision for the purposes of avoiding competition among suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of the other Party or protects domestic suppliers, a procuring entity may use limited tendering and may choose not to apply Articles 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, Articles 9.10.1 through 9.10.4, 9.10.11, and Articles 9.11, 9.13, 9.14, only under any of the following circumstances:

provided that the requirements of the tender documentation are not substantially modified, where:

no tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation;

no tenders that conform to the essential requirements of the tender documentation were submitted;

no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or

the tenders submitted have been collusive.

where the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute goods or services exist for any of the following reasons:

the requirement is for a work of art;

the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or

due to an absence of competition for technical reasons.

for additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods or services that were not included in the initial procurement, where:

a change of supplier for such additional goods or services cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services or installations procured under the initial procurement; and

such separation would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the procuring entity;

insofar as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time using open tendering or selective tendering;

for goods purchased on a commodity market;

where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development. Original development of a first good or service may include limited production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that the good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards, but does not include quantity production or supply to establish commercial viability or to recover research and development costs;

for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the very short term in the case of unusual disposals such as those arising from liquidation, receivership or bankruptcy, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers;

where a contract is awarded to a winner of a design contest provided that:

the contest has been organized in a manner that is consistent with the principles of this Chapter, in particular relating to the publication of a notice of intended procurement; and

the participants are judged by an independent jury with a view to a design contract being awarded to a winner;

and

where additional construction services, which were not included in the initial contract but which were within the objectives of the original tender documentation have, through unforeseen circumstances, become necessary to complete the construction services described therein. In such cases, the total value of contracts awarded for additional construction services may not exceed 50 percent of the amount of the initial contract.

For each contract awarded under paragraph 1, a procuring entity shall prepare a written report that includes:

the name of the procuring entity;

the value and kind of goods or services procured; and

a statement indicating the circumstances and conditions described in paragraph 1 that justify the use of limited tendering.
ARTICLE 9.13: ELECTRONIC AUCTIONS

Where a procuring entity intends to conduct a covered procurement using an electronic auction, the entity shall provide each participant, before commencing the electronic auction, with:
the automatic evaluation method, including the mathematical formula, that is based on the evaluation criteria set out in the tender documentation and that will be used in the automatic ranking or re-ranking during the auction;

the results of any initial evaluation of the elements of its tender where the contract is to be awarded on the basis of the most advantageous tender; and

any other relevant information relating to the conduct of the auction.
ARTICLE 9.14: TREATMENT OF TENDERS AND AWARDING OF CONTRACTS

Receipt and Opening of Tenders
A procuring entity shall receive, open and treat all tenders under procedures that guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement process and shall treat all tenders in confidence until at least the opening of the tenders.

A procuring entity shall not penalise any supplier whose tender is received after the time specified for receiving tenders if the delay is due solely to mishandling on the part of the procuring entity.

Where a procuring entity provides suppliers with opportunities to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall provide the same opportunities to all participating suppliers.

Awarding of Contracts
A procuring entity shall require that in order to be considered for an award, a tender shall be submitted in writing and shall, at the time of opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in the notices and tender documentation and be from a supplier that satisfies the conditions for participation.

Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, the entity shall award the contract to the supplier that the entity has determined to be capable of fulfilling the term of the contract and, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notices and tender documentation, has submitted:

the most advantageous tender; or

where price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.

Where a procuring entity receives a tender with a price that is abnormally lower than the prices in other tenders submitted, it may verify with the supplier that it satisfies the conditions for participation and is capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract.

A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a covered procurement, or terminate or modify awarded contracts in a manner that circumvents this Chapter.
ARTICLE 9.15: DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

Provision of Information to Parties
On request of any other Party, a Party shall provide promptly any information necessary to determine whether a procurement was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with this Chapter, including information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender. In cases where release of the information would prejudice competition in future tenders, the Party that receives the information shall not disclose it to any supplier, except after consulting with, and obtaining the agreement of, the Party that provided the information.

Non-Disclosure of Information

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a procuring entity shall not provide information to particular suppliers that might prejudice fair competition between suppliers.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party, including its procuring entities, authorities and review bodies, to disclose confidential information where disclosure:

would impede law enforcement;

might prejudice fair competition between suppliers;

would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons, including the protection of intellectual property; or

would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.
ARTICLE 9.16: POST-AWARD INFORMATION
A procuring entity shall promptly inform suppliers that have submitted tenders of its contract award decision. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 9.15, a procuring entity shall, upon request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with the reasons that the entity did not select that supplier’s tender and the relative advantages of the successful supplier’s tender.

Not later than 72 days after the award of each contract covered by this Chapter, a procuring entity shall publish a notice in the appropriate paper or electronic medium listed in Annex 9-B. Where the entity publishes the notice only in an electronic medium, the information shall remain readily accessible for a reasonable period of time. The notice shall include at least the following information:

the documentation and reports of tendering procedures and contract awards relating to covered procurement, including the reports required under Article 9.12 ; and

data that ensure the appropriate traceability of the conduct of covered procurement by electronic means.
ARTICLE 9. 17: DOMESTIC REVIEW PROCEDURES
Each Party shall provide a timely, effective, transparent, and non-discriminatory administrative or judicial review procedure through which a supplier may challenge:

a breach of the Chapter; or

where the supplier does not have a right to challenge directly a breach of the Chapter under the law of a Party, a failure to comply with a Party’s measures implementing this Chapter.

The procedural rules for all challenges shall be in writing and made generally available.

In the event of a complaint by a supplier, arising in the context of covered procurement in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest, that there has been a breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1, the Party of the procuring entity conducting the procurement shall encourage the entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the complaint through consultations. The entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any such complaint in a manner that is not prejudicial to the supplier's participation in ongoing or future procurement or its right to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial review procedure.

Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and submit a challenge, which in no case shall be less than 10 days from the time when the basis of the challenge became known or reasonably should have become known to the supplier.

Each Party shall maintain at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority (hereinafter referred to as "review body") that is independent of its procuring entities to receive and review, in a non-discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective manner, complaints that a supplier of a Party submits, in accordance with the Party’s law, relating to a covered procurement.

Where a review body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 4 initially reviews a challenge, the Party shall ensure that the supplier may appeal the initial decision to an impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of the procuring entity whose procurement is the subject of the challenge.

Each Party shall ensure that a review body, that is not a court, shall have its decision subject to judicial review or have procedures that provide that:

the procuring entity shall respond in writing to the challenge and disclose all relevant documents to the review body;

the participants to the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as "participants") shall have the right to be heard prior to a decision of the review body being made on the challenge;

the participants shall have the right to be represented and accompanied;

the participants shall have access to all proceedings;

the participants shall have the right to request that the proceedings take place in public and that witnesses may be presented; and

decisions or recommendations relating to supplier challenges shall be provided, in a timely fashion, in writing, with an explanation of the basis for each decision or recommendation.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for:

rapid interim measures to preserve the supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement. Such interim measures may result in suspension of the procurement process. The procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account when deciding whether such measures should be applied. Just cause for not acting shall be provided in writing; and

where a review body has determined that there has been a breach of this Chapter or a failure, corrective action or compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to either the costs for the preparation of the tender or the costs relating to the challenge, or both.
ARTICLE 9. 18: RECTIFICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS TO COVERAGE
A Party may make rectifications of a purely formal nature to its coverage under this Chapter, or minor amendments to its schedules in Annex 9-A, provided that it notifies the other Party in writing and the other Party does not object in writing within 30 days from notification. A Party that makes such a rectification or minor amendment need not provide compensatory adjustments to the other Party.

A Party may otherwise modify its coverage under this Chapter provided that:

it notifies the other Party in writing and simultaneously offers acceptable compensatory adjustments to the other Party to maintain a level of coverage comparable to that existing prior to the modification, where necessary; and

no objection in writing was submitted by the other Party within 30 days from notification.

A Party need not provide compensatory adjustments when proposing a modification on the grounds that government control or influence over the entity's covered procurement has been effectively eliminated. Where a Party objects to the assertion that such government control or influence has been effectively eliminated, the objecting Party may request further information or consultations with a view of clarifying the nature of any government control or influence and of reaching agreement on the procuring entity’s continued coverage under this Chapter.
ARTICLE 9.19: SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES’ PARTICIPATION
The Parties recognize the importance of the participation of SMEs in government procurement.

Investments made by investors of each Party shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and customary international law, and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Party.

“Fair and equitable treatment” includes the prohibition against denial by any unreasonable measures, of the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments of investors of the Home Party in the Host Party’s territory.

“Fair and equitable treatment” shall not be construed as to prevent a Party from exercising its regulatory powers in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner.

The “Full protection and security” standard does not imply, in any case, a better police protection than that accorded to nationals of the Party where the investment has been made.

A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement or another international agreement does not imply that the fair and equitable treatment has been breached.

Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be made at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer pursuant to the exchange regulations in force in the Host Contacting Party.

In any case, transfers shall be in terms no less favorable than those accorded by the Host Party to its own investors in like circumstances.

Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2:

When a Party is in or under threat of:

serious balance of payments difficulties; or

serious difficulties in macroeconomic management relating to the exchange rate policy or monetary policy,

that Party may, in conformity with the principles laid down within Article VIII of the IMF Agreement, adopt restrictive measures which may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the situation, shall be temporary and shall be eliminated as soon as conditions permit.

Without prejudice to Article 10.12.8, the investors affected shall have a right, under the law of the Host Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of the Host Party, of the legality of the expropriation and of the valuation of their investment, in accordance with the principles set out in this Article.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to intellectual property rights, a Host Party may permit the use of an intellectual property right, provided such permission is made in conformity with the principles set forth in the TRIPS Agreement.

It is understood that the determination whether a measure or series of measures of a Party constitutes an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation requires a case-bycase, fact-based inquiry, considering, inter alia:

The economic impact of the measure or series of measures;3

The level of interference on the reasonable expectations concerning the investment;

The character of the measure or series of measures in accordance with the legitimate public objectives pursued;

the assignment to the Home Party by legislation or by legal transaction of all the rights and claims of the investor indemnified; and

that the Home Party is entitled to exercise such rights and enforce such claims by virtue of subrogation, to the same extent as the investor indemnified, and shall assume the obligations related to the investment.

The home Party shall be entitled in all circumstances to:

the same treatment in respect of rights, claims and obligations acquired by it, by virtue of the assignment; and

Such measures shall be in good faith and shall not be used as means of avoiding a Party´s commitments or obligations under this Chapter.

The provisions of this Chapter, relating to the granting of treatment no less favorable than that accorded to the investors and investments of investors of either Party or of any non-Party, shall not be construed so as to oblige one Party to extend to the investors of the other Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:

any international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation or any legislation relating wholly or mainly to taxation;

any existing or future customs union, free trade area agreement, common market, economic union or similar international agreement, to which either Party is or will be party, within the meaning of "customs union" or "free trade area" in accordance with Article XXIV of the GATT 1994 and Article V of the GATS;

In order to submit a claim to arbitration under this Article, non-judicial local administrative remedies 5 shall be exhausted only if required by the legislation of the Party concerned. If the procedures for the exhaustion of such remedies are not completed within six months from the date of their initiation by the investor, the investor shall not be prevented from submitting a claim to arbitration under this Article. Such procedure shall not prevent the investor from requesting consultations as referred to in paragraph 3. This paragraph does not prevent the investor from voluntarily seeking or pursuing non-judicial local administrative remedies.

Any investment dispute between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with a claim of a breach of the provisions of this Chapter other than Article 10.3.1, Article 10.14 and Article 10.15 shall be settled by consultations and negotiations.

Consultations and negotiations shall begin with the submission of a written Notice (hereinafter referred to as Notice of Dispute) by the investor. This notice shall be accompanied by a brief summary of the factual and legal basis of the investment dispute.

If a dispute under paragraph 2 cannot be settled within six months of a written Notice of Dispute in accordance with paragraph 3, it shall be settled as follows, upon the request of the investor:

by a competent court of the Host Party; or

by conciliation; or

by arbitration by the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, opened for signature at Washington, D.C. on March 18, 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the ICSID Convention), provided that both Parties are contracting parties to the Convention; or 5 In the case of Colombia it the non-judicial local administrative remedies are called “vía gubernativa”.

by arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID (hereinafter referred to as the ICSID Additional Facility Rules), provided that only one of the Parties is a contracting party to the ICSID Convention; or

by an ad hoc arbitration tribunal, which unless otherwise agreed, is to be established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as revised in 2010 Unless otherwise agreed, all submissions shall be made and all hearings shall be completed within six months of the date of selection of the Chairman, and the arbitral panel shall render its written and reasoned decisions within two months of the date of the final submissions or the date of the closing of the hearings, whichever is later;

Subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) shall not apply to disputes between a Host Party and any legal entity qualifying as an Investor of a Home Party, that is owned or controlled by a natural person or legal entity of the Host Party;

an investor shall only submit a dispute to arbitration in accordance with subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e), once 90 days have elapsed from the submission of a written notice (hereinafter referred to as Notice of Intent). The Notice of Intent shall only be submitted if the dispute was not settled within six months from the Notice of Dispute and shall indicate the name and address of the disputing investor, the provisions of this Chapter which he deems to be breached, the facts which the dispute is based on, and the approximate amount of damages.

Each Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with paragraphs 4(c), 4(d) and 4(e). This consent and the submission by a disputing investor of a claim to arbitration shall satisfy the requirements of:

Chapter II of the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties;

Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 (hereinafter referred as to The New York Convention), for an agreement in writing.

As long as both Parties are contracting parties to the ICSID Convention, the provisions set forth in Article 27 thereof shall apply to disputes that have been submitted to arbitration under this Article.

An investor shall not submit a Notice of Dispute if more than three years have elapsed since the date the investor had knowledge or should have had knowledge of the alleged violation of the provisions of this Chapter, as well as of the alleged losses and damages.

 

Once the investor has submitted the dispute to either a competent court of the Host Party or to any of the arbitration mechanisms stated in paragraph 4, the choice of the procedure shall be final;

Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), an investor shall not be prevented from initiating actions, or interim measures not involving the payment of monetary damages before a competent court of the Host Party, provided that the action is initiated for the purpose of preserving the investor's rights and interests.

The award shall be final and binding. Each Party shall carry out without undue delay the provisions of any such award and provide in its territory for the enforcement of such award.

A tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law. A tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the legality of a measure, alleged to constitute a breach of this Chapter, under the legislation of the disputing Party.

The tribunal shall consider whether either the claim of the claimant or the objection of the respondent is manifestly without legal merit, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity for comments. In the event of a claim found to be manifestly without legal merit, the tribunal shall, if warranted, award costs against the claimant.

The Notice of Dispute, the Notice of Intent, and other documents related to the dispute, shall be presented to the authority/agency of the Host Party, designated in Annex 10-A.

The arbitrators shall:

have experience or expertise in international public law, international investment rules, or in dispute settlement derived from international investment agreements;

be independent and not affiliated with or take instructions from the investor, or either Party;

be a national of a country with which both Parties maintain diplomatic relations.

The disputing parties may agree on the fees to be paid to the arbitrators. If the disputing parties do not reach an agreement on the fees to be paid to the arbitrators before the constitution of the tribunal, the fees established for arbitrators by ICSID shall apply.
ARTICLE 10.13: INSURANCE AND GUARANTEE

In any proceeding involving an investment dispute, a Party shall not assert, as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or for any other reason, that indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages has been received or will be received pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract.

ARTICLE 10.14: INVESTMENT AND ENVIRONMENT

Each Party recognizes that it is inappropriate to encourage investments activities, of investors of the other Party and of a non-Party, by relaxing its domestic environmental legislation.

ARTICLE 10.15: RELATION TO OTHER CHAPTERS
In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter to this Agreement, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, it is understood that Article 10.12 will apply solely to disputes in connection with a breach of the provisions of this Chapter as set forth in that Article.
ARTICLE 10.16: DURATION AND TERMINATION

In respect of investments made while this Agreement is in force, its provisions shall remain in effect with respect to such investments for a period of 10 years after the date of termination of this Agreement and without prejudice to the application thereafter of the rules of general international law.

At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities of that Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application.

In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall aim to ensure that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards, and licensing requirements:

are based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to supply the service;

are not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service; and

The Parties shall report periodically to the Joint Committee on progress and on impediments experienced. Any delay or failure by these professional bodies to negotiate or to reach and conclude an agreement on the details of such arrangements shall not be regarded as a breach of a Party’s obligations under this paragraph and shall not be subject to Chapter 12 (Dispute Settlement).

A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing, or certification of service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.

This Article applies to measures affecting natural persons who are service suppliers of a Party, and natural persons of a Party who are employed by a service supplier of a Party, in respect of the supply of a service.

Natural persons covered by a specific commitment as inscribed in the Parties' respective schedules, shall be allowed to supply the service, in accordance with the terms of that commitment.

This Chapter shall not prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across, its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Party under the terms of a specific commitment. 6

Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with that Party’s obligations under Article 11.3 and specific commitments.

Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to that Party’s specific commitments, the Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.

The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect:

authorizes or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and

substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.
ARTICLE 11.12: BUSINESS PRACTICES
Parties recognize that certain business practices of service suppliers, other than those falling under Article 11.11, may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in services.

Each Party shall, at the request of any other Party, enter into consultations with a view to eliminating practices referred to in paragraph 1. The Party addressed shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall co-operate through the supply of publicly available non-confidential information of relevance to the matter in question. The Party addressed shall also provide other information available to the requesting Party, subject to its domestic law and to the conclusion of satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting Party.
ARTICLE 11.13: PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS
Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 11.14, a Party shall not apply restrictions on international transfers and payments for current transactions with the other Party, relating to its specific commitments.

Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under the IMF Agreement, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with that Agreement, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on capital transactions inconsistently with its specific commitments regarding such transactions, except under Article 11.14 or at the request of the International Monetary Fund.
ARTICLE 11.14: RESTRICTIONS TO SAFEGUARD THE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS
The Parties shall endeavor to avoid the imposition of restrictions to safeguard the balance of payments.

A Party adopting or maintaining such restrictions shall promptly notify the Joint Committee thereof.
ARTICLE 11.15: SCHEDULES OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS
Each Party shall set out in a schedule the specific commitments it undertakes under Articles 11.4, 11.5, and 11.6. With respect to sectors where such commitments are undertaken, each schedule shall specify:

terms, limitations and conditions on market access;

conditions and qualifications on national treatment;

undertakings relating to additional commitments referred to in Article 11.6; and

where appropriate, the time-frame for implementation of such commitments and the date of entry into force of such commitments.

Measures inconsistent with both Articles 11.4 and 11.5 are inscribed in the column relating to Article 11.4. In this case, the inscription is considered to provide a condition or qualification to Article 11.5 as well.
ARTICLE 11.16: REVIEW
With the objective of further liberalizing trade in services between them, the Parties shall review their schedules of specific commitments and their Lists of MFN Exemptions at least every three years to provide for a reduction or elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination between the Parties with regard to trade in services covered in this Chapter on a mutually advantageous basis and ensuring an overall balance of rights and obligations. The first such review shall take place not later than two years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

The Parties shall jointly review the negotiations provided for in paragraph 4 of Article VI and paragraph 1 of Article XV of the GATS and incorporate any results of such negotiations, as appropriate, into this Chapter.

DISPUTE SETTLEMENT

ARTICLE 12.1: OBJECTIVE
The objective of this Chapter is to provide an effective and efficient dispute settlement process between the Parties regarding their rights and obligations under this Agreement.

The Parties shall endeavor to agree regarding the interpretation and application of this Agreement and shall make all efforts through cooperation, consultation, or other means, to reach a mutually agreed solution concerning any matter that might affect its operation.

A solution mutually acceptable to the Parties to a dispute and consistent with this Agreement is clearly to be preferred. In the absence of a mutually agreed solution, the first objective of this Chapter will be in general to secure the withdrawal of the measures concerned if these are found to be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 12.2: SCOPE AND COVERAGE
Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the provisions of this Chapter shall apply with respect to any dispute arising from the interpretation, application, fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the provisions contained in this Agreement.

If any Party considers that any benefit it could reasonably have expected to accrue to it under any provision of this Agreement is being nullified or impaired as a result of the application of any measure by the other Party that is not inconsistent with this Agreement, the Party may have recourse to dispute settlement under this Chapter.

In considering which benefits to suspend under paragraph 1, the complaining Party should first seek to suspend the application of benefits in the same sector or sectors as those affected by the measure or other matter that the Arbitral Tribunal has found to be inconsistent with this Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment. In case the complaining Party considers that it is impracticable or ineffective to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors, it may suspend benefits in other sectors.

The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and be applied by the complaining Party, only:

until the measure found to violate this Agreement has been withdrawn or amended so as to comply with the original award and with the provisions of this Agreement; or

until an Arbitral Tribunal decides that the compliance measure is compatible with the award and with the provisions of this Agreement; or

until the Parties have otherwise settled the dispute.

In these cases the suspension of benefits shall be terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph 6.

To terminate a suspension of benefits, the Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party of any measure adopted to comply with the original award and the provisions of this Agreement or of its compliance with the agreement on compensation. Such notification shall be accompanied by a request to terminate the suspension of benefits.

In the event of disagreement between the Parties with respect to the existence or conformity of the notified measure with this Agreement and the original award or in the event of a disagreement as to the compliance with the agreement on compensation, within 60 days from the date of the notification, either Party may refer the matter under Article 12.17.1(a) to the original Arbitral Tribunal to determine consistency of such measure with this Agreement and the original award or to determine compliance with the agreement on compensation. If pursuant to Article 12.17.1(a), the Arbitral Tribunal determines that the notified measure is consistent with the Agreement and the original award or determines there has been compliance with the agreement on compensation, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated.

In the event there is no disagreement between the Parties as to the conformity of the notified measure with this Agreement and the original award or as to the compliance with the agreement on compensation, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated within 30 days from the date of such notification.

In the case that the Parties have settled a dispute, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated on the date agreed to by the Parties.
ARTICLE 12.17: REVIEW OF COMPLIANCE AND REVIEW OF SUSPENSION OF BENEFITS
In case of disagreement between the Parties with respect to:

the existence or conformity with the provisions of this Agreement and the original award of measures taken by the Party complained against to comply with this Agreement and the original award or with respect to compliance with the agreement on compensation; and/or

whether the level of benefits that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend or has suspended pursuant to Article 12.16 is manifestly excessive,

either Party may refer the matter to the original Arbitral Tribunal.

An Arbitral Tribunal under paragraph 1 shall issue its award within 30 days after the matter has been referred to it where the request concerns either paragraph 1(a) or 1(b) only, and within 50 days, where the request concerns both paragraphs.

In case the original Arbitration Tribunal, or any of its members, is not available, the procedures established in Article 12.10 shall apply. The award shall be issued within the period provided for in paragraph 2, from the date of establishment of the new Arbitral Tribunal.
