Where any product of one Party is being imported into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause: (a) serious injury to the domestic industry of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing Party; or (b) serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region of the importing Party, the importing Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article. 2. Safeguard measures shall not exceed what is necessary to remedy the difficulties which have arisen and should normally consist of the suspension of the further reduction of any applicable rate of duty provided for under this Decision for the product concerned or the increase of the rate of duty for that product. 3. Such measures shall contain clear elements progressively leading to their elimination at the end of the set period, at the latest. Measures shall not be taken for a period exceeding one year. In very exceptional circumstances, measures may be taken up to a total maximum period of three years. No safeguard measure shall be applied to the import of a product which has previously been subject to such a measure for a period of, at least, three years since the expiry of the measure. 4. The Party intending to take safeguard measures under this Article shall offer the other Party compensation in the form of substantially equivalent trade liberalisation in relation to the imports from the latter. The offer of liberalisation shall normally consist of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or concessions substantially equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the safeguard measure. 5. The offer shall be made prior to the adoption of the safeguard measure and simultaneously with the supply of information and referral to the Joint Committee, as provided for in this Article. Should the offer not be considered satisfactory by the Party against whose product the safeguard measure is intended to be taken, both Parties may agree, in the consultations referred to in this Article, on other means of trade compensation. 6. If the Parties concerned are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose product the safeguard measure is taken may take compensatory tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the safeguard measure taken under this Article. The Party taking compensatory tariff action shall apply it, as a maximum, for the period necessary to achieve equivalent trade effects. WT/REG109/1 Page 14 7. In the cases specified in this Article, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in the cases to which paragraph 8(b) of this Article applies, as soon as possible, the Community or Mexico, as the case may be, shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the two Parties. 8. For the implementation of the above paragraphs the following provisions shall apply: (a) The difficulties arising from the situation referred to in this Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decisions needed to put an end to such difficulties. If the Joint Committee or the exporting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem, and, in the absence of mutually agreed compensation, the Party against whose product the measure is taken may take compensatory tariff action in accordance with this Article. Such compensatory tariff action shall be immediately notified to the Joint Committee. In the selection of safeguard measures and compensatory tariff action, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements established in this Decision. (b) Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in this Article, apply forthwith precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof. (c) The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. 9. In the event of the Community or Mexico subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in this Article to an administrative procedure having at its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party. Article 16 Shortage clause 1. Where compliance with the provisions of Chapter I or Article 12 leads to: (a) a critical shortage, or threat thereof, of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting Party; or (b) a shortage of essential quantities of domestic materials to a domestic processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as part of a governmental stabilisation plan; or (c) re-export to a third country of a product against which the exporting Party maintains export customs duties or export prohibitions or restrictions, and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may adopt export restrictions or export customs duties. WT/REG109/1 Page 15 2. In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Decision. Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance. In addition, the measures which may be adopted pursuant to paragraph 1(b) of this Article shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection afforded to the domestic processing industry concerned, and shall not depart from the provisions of this Decision relating to non-discrimination. 3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 of this Article applies the Community or Mexico, as the case may be, shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the two Parties. The Parties within the Joint Committee may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article on the exportation of the product concerned. 4. Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or Mexico, whichever is concerned, may apply forthwith the precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately thereof. 5. Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately notified to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their elimination as soon as circumstances permit.

Article 19 Standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures 1. This Article applies to standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures as defined in the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (hereinafter "the TBT Agreement") that may directly or indirectly affect trade in products. It does not apply to sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which are covered by Article 20 of this Decision. 2. The Parties confirm their rights and obligations relating to standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures under the TBT Agreement. 3.

TITLE III Government Procurement Article 25 Coverage 1. This Title applies to any law, regulation, procedure or practice regarding any procurement: (a) by entities set out in Annex VI; (b) of goods in accordance with Annex VII, services in accordance with Annex VIII, or construction services in accordance with Annex IX; WT/REG109/1 Page 20 (c) where the value of the contract to be awarded is estimated to be equal to or greater than a threshold as set out in Annex X .3 2. Paragraph 1 is subject to the provisions set out in Annex XI. 3. Subject to paragraph 4, where a contract to be awarded by an entity is not covered by this Title, this Title shall not be construed to cover any good or service component of that contract. 4. No Party may prepare, design or otherwise structure any procurement contract in order to avoid the obligations of this Title. 5. Procurement includes procurement by such methods as purchase, lease or rental, with or without an option to buy. 6. Procurement does not include: (a) non-contractual agreements or any form of government assistance, including cooperative agreements, grants, loans, equity infusions, guarantees, fiscal incentives, and government provision of goods and services to persons or state, provincial and regional governments; and (b) the acquisition of fiscal agency or depository services, liquidation and management services for regulated financial institutions and sale and distribution services for government debt. Article 26 National treatment and non-discrimination 1. With respect to all laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement covered by this Title, each Party shall provide immediately and unconditionally to the products, services and suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that accorded to domestic products, services and suppliers. 2. With respect to all laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement covered by this Title, each Party shall ensure: (a) that its entities do not treat a locally-established supplier less favourably than another locally-established supplier on the basis of the degree of foreign affiliation to, or ownership by, a person of the other Party; and, (b) that its entities do not discriminate against locally-established suppliers on the basis of the country of production of the good or service being supplied, provided that the country of production is the other Party. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on, or in connection with, importation, the method of levying such duties and charges, other import regulations and formalities, and measures affecting trade in services other than laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement covered by this Title. 3 The threshold value shall be calculated and adjusted according to the provisions set out in Annex X. WT/REG109/1 Page 21 Article 27 Rules of origin 1. No Party may apply rules of origin to goods imported from the other Party for purposes of government procurement covered by this Title that are different from, or inconsistent with, the rules of origin which that Party applies in the normal course of trade. 2. A Party may deny the benefits of this Title to a service supplier of the other Party, subject to prior notification and consultation, where the Party establishes that the service is being provided by an enterprise that is owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party and that has no substantial business activities in the territory of either Party. Article 28 Prohibition of offsets Each Party shall ensure that its entities do not, in the qualification and selection of suppliers, goods or services, in the evaluation of bids or the award of contracts, consider, seek or impose offsets. For purposes of this Article, offsets means conditions imposed or considered by an entity prior to, or in the course of, its procurement process that encourage local development or improve its Party's balance-of-payments accounts, by means of requirements of local content, licensing of technology, investment, counter-trade or similar requirements. Article 29 Procurement procedures and other provisions 1. Mexico shall apply the rules and procedures specified in Part A of Annex XII and the Community shall apply the rules and procedures specified in Part B of Annex XII Both sets of rules and procedures are considered to provide equivalent treatment. 2. The rules and procedures specified in Annex XII may only be modified by the Party concerned in order to reflect amendments to the corresponding provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (hereinafter NAFTA) and the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (hereinafter GPA), respectively, provided that the rules and procedures applied by that Party, as modified, continue to afford equivalent treatment. 3. If a Party modifies its respective rules and procedures contained in Annex XII, pursuant to paragraph 2, it shall previously consult with the other Party and shall bear the burden of proving that the rules and procedures, as modified, continue to afford equivalent treatment. 4. The Party concerned shall notify the other Party of any modification to the rules and procedures specified in Annex XII no later than 30 days prior to their date of entry into force. 5. Where a Party considers that such a modification affects access to the other Party's procurement market considerably, it can request consultations. If no satisfactory solution can be found the Party may have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under Title VI, with a view to maintaining an equivalent level of access to the other Party's procurement market. 6. No entity of a Party may make it a condition for the qualification of suppliers and for the awarding of a contract that the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by an entity of that Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of that Party. WT/REG109/1 Page 22 Article 30 Bid challenge 1. In the event of a complaint by a supplier that there has been a breach of this Title in the context of a procurement, each Party shall encourage the supplier to seek resolution of its complaint in consultation with the procuring entity. In such instances the procuring entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any such complaint, in a manner that is not prejudicial to obtaining corrective measures under the challenge system. 2. Each Party shall provide non-discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective procedures enabling suppliers to challenge alleged breaches of this Title arising in the context of procurements in which they have, or have had, an interest. 3. Each Party shall provide its challenge procedures in writing and make them generally available. 4. Each Party shall ensure that documentation relating to all aspects of the process concerning procurements covered by this Title shall be retained for three years. 5. The interested supplier may be required to initiate a challenge procedure and notify the procuring entity within specified time-limits from the time when the basis of the complaint is known or reasonably should have been known, but in no case within a period of less than 10 days from that time. 6. A Party may require under its legislation that a bid challenge be initiated only after the notice of procurement has been published or, where a notice is not published, after tender documentation has been made available. Where a Party imposes such a requirement, the 10-day period described in paragraph 5 shall begin no earlier than the date that the notice is published or the tender documentation is made available. Nothing in this provision precludes the right of interested suppliers to judicial review. 7. Challenges shall be heard by an impartial and independent reviewing authority with no interest in the outcome of the procurement and the members of which are secure from external influence during the term of appointment. A reviewing authority which is not a court shall either be subject to judicial review or shall have procedures which provide that: (a) participants can be heard before an opinion is given or a decision is reached; (b) participants can be represented and accompanied; (c) participants shall have access to all proceedings; (d) proceedings can take place in public; (e) opinions or decisions are given in writing with a statement describing the basis for the opinions or decisions; (f) witnesses can be presented; and (g) documents are disclosed to the reviewing authority. WT/REG109/1 Page 23 8. Challenge procedures shall provide for: (a) rapid interim measures to correct breaches of this Title and to preserve commercial opportunities. Such action may result in suspension of the procurement process. However, procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account in deciding whether such measures should be applied. In such circumstances, just cause for not acting shall be provided in writing; and (b) where appropriate, correction of the breach of this Title or compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to costs for tender preparation or protest. 9. With a view to the preservation of the commercial and other interests involved, the challenge procedure shall normally be completed in a timely fashion. Article 31 Provision of information 1. Each Party shall promptly publish any law, regulation, precedential judicial decision, administrative ruling of general application and any procedure regarding government procurement covered by this Title in the appropriate publications referred to in Annex XIII. 2. Each Party shall designate at the entry into force of this Decision one or more contact points to: (a) facilitate communication between the Parties; (b) answer all reasonable inquiries from the other Party to provide relevant information on matters covered by this Title; and (c) on request of a supplier of a Party, provide in writing within a reasonable time period a reasoned answer to the supplier and the other Party as to whether a specific entity is covered by this Title. 3. A Party may seek such additional information on the award of the contract as may be necessary to determine whether the procurement was made fairly and impartially, in particular with respect to unsuccessful tenders. To this end, the Party of the procuring entity shall provide information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the winning tender and the contract price. Where release of this information would prejudice competition in future tenders, the information shall not be released by the requesting Party, except after consultation with, and agreement of, the Party that provided the information. 4. On request, each Party shall provide to the other Party information available to that Party and its entities concerning covered procurement of its entities and the individual contracts awarded by its entities. 5. No Party may disclose confidential information the disclosure of which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of a particular person or might prejudice fair competition between suppliers, without the formal authorisation of the person that provided the information to that Party. WT/REG109/1 Page 24 6. Nothing in this Title shall be construed as requiring any Party to disclose confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest. 7. Each Party shall collect and exchange on an annual basis statistics on its procurements covered by this Title.4 Such reports shall contain the following information with respect to contracts awarded by all procurement entities covered under this Title: (a) for entities in Annexes VI.A.1 and VI.B.1, statistics on the estimated value of contracts awarded, both above and below the threshold value, on a global basis and broken down by entities; for entities in Annexes VI.A.2 and VI.B.2, statistics on the estimated value of contracts awarded above the threshold value on a global basis and broken down by categories of entities; (b) for entities in Annexes VI.A.1 and VI.B.1, statistics on the number and total value of contracts awarded above the applicable threshold value, broken down by entities and categories of products and services; for entities in Annexes VI.A.2 and VI.B.2, statistics on the estimated value of contracts awarded above the threshold value broken down by categories of entities and categories of products and services; (c) for entities in Annexes VI.A.1 and VI.B.1, statistics broken down by entity and by categories of products and services, on the number and total value of contracts awarded under limited tendering procedures; for categories of entities in Annexes VI.A.2 and VI.B.2, statistics on the total value of contracts awarded above the threshold value under each of the cases of limited tendering procedures; and (d) for entities in Annexes VI.A.1 and VI.B.1, statistics broken down by entities, on the number and total value of contracts awarded under derogations to the Title contained in the relevant Annexes; for categories of entities in Annexes VI.A.2 and VI.B.2, statistics on the total value of contracts awarded under derogations to the Title contained in the relevant Annexes. 8. To the extent that such information is available, each Party shall provide statistics on the country of origin of products and services purchased by its entities. With a view to ensuring that such statistics are comparable, the Special Committee established under Article 32 shall provide guidance on the methods to be used. With a view to ensuring effective monitoring of procurements covered by this Title, the Joint Council may decide to modify the requirements of subparagraphs (a) to (d) of paragraph 7 as regards the nature and the extent of statistical information to be exchanged.5 Article 32 Technical cooperation 1. The Joint Council hereby establishes a Special Committee on Government Procurement. The Special Committee shall be comprised of representatives of the Parties and may invite procurement officials of the covered entities and representatives of their respective suppliers. The Special Committee shall meet once a year, or when necessary, to discuss the operation of this Title and, where 4 The first exchange of information under paragraph 7 of Article 31 will take place two years after the entry into force of this Decision. In the meantime, the Parties will communicate to each other all available and comparable relevant data on a reciprocal basis. 5 The Joint Council shall modify this provision taking into account the future revisions of the GPA or NAFTA. WT/REG109/1 Page 25 necessary, make recommendations for the improvement and amendment of its scope. The Special Committee shall report annually to the Joint Committee. 2. Its functions shall include: (a) analysing available information on each Party's procurement market including the statistical information provided under paragraph 7 of Article 31; (b) evaluating the effective access of suppliers of a Party to procurements of the other Party covered under this Title and recommending, where necessary, appropriate measures to enhance the conditions for effective access to a Party's procurement market; (c) promoting government procurement opportunities for suppliers from both Parties; and (d) monitoring the application of the provisions of this Title and providing a forum to identify and address any problems or other issues that may arise. 3. The Parties shall cooperate, on mutually agreed terms, to increase the understanding of their respective government procurement systems, with a view to maximise the access to government procurement opportunities for the suppliers of both Parties. 4. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to provide to the other Party and to the suppliers of the other Party, on a cost recovery basis, information concerning training and orientation programs regarding its government procurement system, and access on a non-discriminatory basis to any program it conducts. 5. The training and orientation programs referred to in paragraph 4 include: (a) training of government personnel directly involved in government procurement procedures; (b) training of suppliers interested in pursuing government procurement opportunities; (c) an explanation and description of specific elements of each Party's government procurement system, such as its bid challenge mechanism; and (d) information about government procurement market opportunities. 6. Each Party shall establish at least one contact point to provide information on the training and orientation programs referred to in this Article at the entry into force of this Decision. Article 33 Information technology 1. The Parties shall cooperate with a view to ensuring that the type of procurement information, notably in tender notices and documentation, held on their respective databases is comparable in terms of quality and accessibility. The Parties shall also cooperate with a view to ensuring that the type of information exchanged through their respective electronic means between interested parties for the purposes of public procurement is comparable in terms of quality and accessibility. WT/REG109/1 Page 26 2. Paying due attention to issues of interoperability and interconnectivity, and after having agreed that the type of procurement information referred to in paragraph 1 is comparable, the Parties shall grant access to suppliers of the other Party to relevant procurement information, such as tender notices, held on their respective databases, and to their respective electronic procurement systems, such as electronic tendering, in accordance with Article 26. Article 34 Exceptions Provided that such measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties, nothing in this Title shall be construed to prevent any Party from adopting or maintaining measures: (a) necessary to protect public morals, order or safety; (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; (c) necessary to protect intellectual property; or (d) relating to goods or services of handicapped persons, of philanthropic institutions or of prison labour. Article 35 Rectifications or modifications 1. Each Party may modify its coverage under this Title only in exceptional circumstances. 2. Where a Party modifies its coverage under this Title, that Party shall: (a) notify the other Party of the modification; (b) reflect the change in the appropriate Annex; and (c) propose to the other Party appropriate compensatory adjustments to its coverage in order to maintain a level of coverage comparable to that existing prior to the modification. 3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may make rectifications of a purely formal nature and minor amendments to Annexes VI to IX and XI, provided that it notifies such rectifications to the other Party and the other Party does not object to such proposed rectification within 30 days. In such cases, compensation need not be proposed. 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, a Party may undertake reorganisations of its government procurement entities covered by this Title, including programs through which the procurement of such entities is decentralised or the corresponding government functions cease to be performed by any government entity whether or not subject to this Title, provided that it notifies such reorganisations to the other Party. In such cases, compensation need not be proposed. No Party may undertake such reorganisations or programs to avoid the obligations of this Title. WT/REG109/1 Page 27 5. Where a Party considers that: (a) an adjustment proposed under paragraph 2(c) is not adequate to maintain a comparable level of mutually agreed coverage; or (b) a rectification or amendment does not meet the requirements of paragraph 3 and should be compensated, the Party may have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under Title VI. 6. Where a Party considers that a reorganisation of procurement entities does not meet the requirements of paragraph 4 and should be compensated, it may have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under Title VI, provided that it has objected to such reorganisation within 30 days from the date of the notification. Article 36 Privatisation of entities 1. Where a Party wishes to withdraw an entity from Section 2 of Annex VI.A or VI.B, as appropriate, on the grounds that government control over it has been effectively eliminated, that Party shall notify the other Party.6 2. Where a Party objects to the withdrawal on the grounds that the entity remains subject to government control, the Parties will enter into consultations to restore the balance of their offers. Article 37 Further negotiations In the case that the Community or Mexico offer a GPA or NAFTA Party, respectively, additional advantages with regard to the access to their respective procurement markets beyond what has been agreed under this Title, they shall agree to enter into negotiations with the other Party with a view to extending these advantages to the other Party on a reciprocal basis. Article 38 Final provisions 1. The Joint Council may adopt appropriate measures to enhance the conditions for effective access to a Party's covered procurement or, as the case may be, adjust a Party's coverage so that such conditions for effective access are maintained on an equitable basis. 6 Where both Parties have adopted rules that allow a covered entity to derogate from procurement procedures if such entity intends to purchase exclusively to enable it to provide goods or services where other market participants are free to offer the same goods or services in the same geographical area and under substantially the same conditions, the Parties shall review the wording of this provision accordingly. In case Article XXIV:6(b) of the GPA or Article 1023 of NAFTA is amended, the Parties shall review the wording of this provision accordingly. The amended provision of the GPA or NAFTA shall not apply between the Parties until it has been incorporated in accordance with this paragraph. WT/REG109/1 Page 28 2. Both Parties shall provide each other with illustrative information on their respective government enterprise markets in accordance with the format contained in Annex XIV subject to any applicable confidentiality provisions existing in their respective legal systems. 3.

The provisions of this Title shall apply with respect to any matter arising from this Decision or from Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Interim Agreement (hereinafter the "covered legal instruments"). 2. By way of exception, the arbitration procedure laid down in Chapter III shall not be applicable in the case of disputes concerning Articles 14, 19(2), 20(1), 21, 23, and 40 of this Decision. CHAPTER II Consultation Article 42 Consultation 1. The Parties shall at all times endeavour to agree on the interpretation and application of the covered legal instruments and shall make every attempt through cooperation and consultations to arrive to a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter that might affect their operation. 2. Each Party may request consultations within the Joint Committee with respect to any matter relating to the application or interpretation of the covered legal instruments or any other matter that it considers might affect their operation. 3. The Joint Committee shall convene within 30 days of delivery of the request and shall endeavour to resolve the dispute promptly by means of a decision. That decision shall specify the implementing measures to be taken by the Party concerned, and the period of time to do so. CHAPTER III Arbitration Procedure Article 34 Establishment of an arbitration panel 1. In case a Party considers that a measure applied by the other Party violates the covered legal instruments and such matter has not been resolved within 15 days after the Joint Committee has convened pursuant to Article 42(3) or 45 days after the delivery of the request for a Joint Committee meeting, either Party may request in writing the establishment of an arbitration panel. WT/REG109/1 Page 30 2. The requesting Party shall state in the request the measure and indicate the provisions of the covered legal instruments that it considers relevant, and shall deliver the request to the other Party and to the Joint Committee. Article 44 Appointment of arbitrators 1. The requesting Party shall notify the other Party of the appointment of an arbitrator, and propose up to 3 candidates to serve as a chair. The other Party must then appoint a second arbitrator within 15 days, and propose up to 3 candidates to serve as a chair. 2. Both Parties shall endeavour to agree on the chair within 15 days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. 3. The date of establishment of the arbitration panel shall be the date on which the chair is appointed. 4. If a Party fails to appoint its arbitrator pursuant to paragraph 1, such arbitrator shall be selected by lot from the candidates proposed. If the Parties are unable to agree on the chair within the time period referred to in paragraph 2, it shall be selected by lot within one week from the candidates proposed. 5. If an arbitrator dies, withdraws or is removed, a replacement shall be selected within 15 days in accordance with the selection procedure followed to select him or her. In such a case, any time period applicable to the arbitration panel proceeding shall be suspended for a period beginning on the date the arbitrator dies, withdraws or is removed and ending on the date the replacement is selected. Article 45 Panel reports 1. The arbitration panel should, as a general rule, submit an initial report containing its findings and conclusions to the Parties not later than three months from the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. In no case should it do so later than five months from this date. Any Party may submit written comments to the arbitration panel on its initial report within 15 days of presentation of the report. 2. The arbitration panel shall present to the Parties a final report within 30 days of presentation of the initial report. 3. In cases of urgency, including those involving perishable goods, the arbitration panel shall make every effort to issue its final report to the Parties within three months from the date of establishment of the arbitration panel. In no case should it do so later than four months. The arbitration panel may give a preliminary ruling on whether a case is urgent. 4. All decisions of the arbitration panel, including the adoption of the final report and of any preliminary ruling, shall be taken by majority vote, each arbitrator having one vote. 5. The complaining Party may withdraw its complaint at any time before the final report has been issued. Such withdrawal is without prejudice to its right to introduce a new complaint regarding the same issue at a later point in time. WT/REG109/1 Page 31 Article 46 Implementation of panel reports 1. Each Party shall be bound to take the measures involved in carrying out the final report referred to in Article 45 (2). 2. The Party concerned shall inform the other Party within 30 days after the final report has been issued of its intentions in respect of its implementation. 3. The Parties shall endeavour to agree on the specific measures that are required for implementing the final report. 4. The Party concerned shall promptly comply with the final report. If it is impracticable to comply immediately, the Parties shall endeavour to agree on a reasonable period of time to do so. In the absence of such agreement, either Party may request the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time, in light of the particular circumstances of the case. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 15 days from that request. 5. The Party concerned shall notify to the other Party the measures adopted in order to implement the final report before the expiry of the reasonable period of time determined in accordance with paragraph 4. Upon that notification, any of the Parties may request the original arbitration panel to rule on the conformity of those measures with the final report. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 60 days from that request. 6. If the Party concerned fails to notify the implementing measures before the expiry of the reasonable period of time determined in accordance with paragraph 4, or if the arbitration panel rules that the implementing measures notified by the Party concerned are inconsistent with the final report, such Party shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, enter into consultations with a view to agree on a mutually acceptable compensation. If no such agreement has been reached within 20 days from the request, the complaining Party shall be entitled to suspend only the application of benefits granted under the covered legal instruments equivalent to those affected by the measure found to violate the covered legal instruments. 7. In considering what benefits to suspend, a complaining Party should first seek to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by the measure that the panel has found to violate the covered legal instruments. A complaining Party that considers it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors may suspend benefits in other sectors. 8. The complaining Party shall notify the other Party of the benefits which it intends to suspend no later than 60 days before the date on which the suspension is due to take effect. Within 15 days from that notification, any of the Parties may request the original arbitration panel to rule on whether the benefits which the complaining Party intends to suspend are equivalent to those affected by the measure found to violate the covered legal instruments, and whether the proposed suspension is in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 45 days from that request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration Panel has issued its ruling. 9. The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall only be applied by the complaining Party until the measure found to violate the covered legal instruments has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with the covered legal instruments, or the Parties have reached agreement on a resolution of the dispute. WT/REG109/1 Page 32 10. At the request of any of the Parties, the original arbitration panel shall rule on the conformity with the final report of any implementing measures adopted after the suspension of benefits and, in light of such ruling, whether the suspension of benefits should be terminated or modified. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 30 days from the date of that request. 11. The rulings provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, 8 and 10 shall be binding. Article 47 General provisions 1. Any time period mentioned in this Title may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties. 2. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitration panel proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the Model Rules of Procedure set out in Annex XVI. The Joint Committee may amend the Model Rules of Procedure. 3. Arbitration proceedings established under this Title will not consider issues relating to each Party's rights and obligations under the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 4. Recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of this Title shall be without prejudice to any possible action in the WTO framework, including dispute settlement action. However, where a Party has, with regard to a particular matter, instituted a dispute settlement proceeding under either Article 43(1) of this Title or the WTO Agreement, it shall not institute a dispute settlement proceeding regarding the same matter under the other forum until such time as the first proceeding has ended. For purposes of this paragraph, dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement are deemed to be initiated by a Party's request for a panel under Article 6 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes of the WTO.
