contracting parties to the convention on the protection of the black sea against pollution (bucharest convention, 21 april 1992)recognising that in recent decades there have been significant human induced changes in the biota and physico-chemical conditions of the black sea;concerned that threats to biodiversity, such as eutrophication, over-fishing, pollution and introduction of non-native species continue;accepting the importance of pollution control in the black sea for the conservation of biodiversity and the maintenance and restoration of ecosystem functions;recalling that under article 13 of the bucharest convention when taking measures for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment of the black sea, the contracting parties are required to pay particular attention to avoiding harm to marine life and living resources, in particular by changes to their habitats through fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea;further recalling that- protocol on protection of the black sea marine environment against pollution from land-based sources;- protocol on co-operation in combating pollution of the black sea marine environment by oil and other harmful substances in emergency situations- protocol on the protection of the black sea marine environment against pollution by dumpingare in force under the convention on the protection of the black sea against pollutionrecalling that in april 1993 the environment ministers from all six black sea countries signed a common policy declaration (the ministerial declaration on protection of the black sea against pollution, odessa, 1993) in which they agreed:- to encourage the development of comprehensive and co-ordinated plans for the restoration and conservation of biodiversity in the black sea in the spirit of the convention on biological diversity (june 5, 1992, rio de janeiro, brazil)- to take appropriate measures for the restoration and conservation of biodiversity in the black sea in the spirit of the convention on biological diversity (june 5, 1992, rio de janeiro, brazil)- to establish and improve nature conservation areas in the coastal zone of each of the coastal states before 1996bearing in mind that all of the black sea countries have signed and ratified the convention on biodiversity (june 5, 1992, rio de janeiro, brazil);further bearing in mind that some of the contracting parties have also signed and ratified other relevant conventions and agreements, e.g. convention on wetlands of international importance especially as waterfowl habitat (february 2, 1971,
