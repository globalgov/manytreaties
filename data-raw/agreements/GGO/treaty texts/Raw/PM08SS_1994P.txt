impact assessments are to be evaluated ANNEX voil and oily mixtures and drilling fluids and cuttingsthe following provisions shall be prescribed by the parties in accordance with article 10:a. oil and oily mixtures1. spills of high oil content in processing drainage and platform drainage shall be contained, diverted and then treated as part of the product, but the remainder shall be treated to an acceptable level before discharge, in accordance with good oilfield practice;2. oily waste and sludges from separation processes shall be transported to shore;3. all the necessary precautions shall be taken to minimize losses of oil into the sea from oil collected or flared from well testing;4. all the necessary precautions shall be taken to ensure that any gas resulting from oil activities should be flared or used in an appropriate manner.b. drilling fluids and drill cuttings1. water-based drilling fluids and drill cuttings shall be subject to the following requirements:(a) the use and disposal of such drilling fluids shall be subject to the chemical use plan and the provisions of article 9 of this protocol;(b) the disposal of the drill cuttings shall either be made on land or into the sea in an appropriate site or area as specified by the competent authority.2. oil-based drilling fluids and drill cuttings are subject to the following requirements:(a) such fluids shall only be used if they are of a sufficiently low toxicity and only after the operator has been issued a permit by the competent authority when it has verified such low toxicity;(b) the disposal into the sea of such drilling fluids is prohibited;(c) the disposal of the drill cuttings into the sea is only permitted on condition that efficient solids control equipment is installed and properly operated, that the discharge point is well below the surface of the water, and that the oil content is less than 100 grams of oil per kilogram dry cuttings;(d) the disposal of such drill cuttings in specially protected areas is prohibited;(e) in case of production and development drilling, a programme of seabed sampling and analysis relating to the zone of contamination must be undertaken.3. diesel-based drilling fluids:the use of diesel-based drilling fluids is prohibited. diesel oil may exceptionally be added to drilling fluids in such circumstances as the parties may specify ANNEX visafety measuresthe following provisions shall be prescribed by the parties in accordance with article 15:(a) that the installation must be safe and fit for the purpose for which it is to be used, in particular, that it must be designed and constructed so as to withstand, together with its maximum load, any natural condition, including, more specifically, maximum wind and wave conditions as established by historical weather patterns, earthquake possibilities, seabed conditions and stability, and water depth;(b) that all phases of the activities, including storage and transport of recovered resources, must be properly prepared, that the whole activity must be open to control for safety reasons and must be conducted in the safest possible way, and that the operator must apply a monitoring system for all activities;(c) that the most advanced safety systems must be used and periodically tested in order to minimize the dangers of leakages, spillages, accidental discharges, fire, explosions, blow-outs or any other threat to human safety or the environment, that a trained specialized crew to operate and maintain these systems must be present and that this crew must undertake periodic exercises. in the case of authorized not permanently manned installations, the permanent availability of a specialized crew shall be ensured;(d) that the installation and, where necessary, the established safety zone, must be marked in accordance with international recommendations so as to give adequate warning of its presence and sufficient details for its identification;(e) that in accordance with international maritime practice, the installations must be indicated on charts and notified to those concerned;(f) that, in order to secure observance of the foregoing provisions, the person and/ or persons having the responsibility for the installation and/ or the activities, including the person responsible for the blow-out preventer, must have the qualifications required by the competent authority, and that sufficient qualified staff must be permanently available. such qualifications shall include, in particular, training, on a continuing basis, in safety and environmental matters ANNEX viicontingency plana. the operator's contingency plan1. operators are obliged to ensure:(a) that the most appropriate alarm system and communication system are available at the installation and they are in good working order;(b) that the alarm is immediately raised on the occurrence of an emergency and that any emergency is immediately communicated to the competent authority;(c) that, in coordination with the competent authority, transmission of the alarm and appropriate assistance and coordination of assistance can be organized and supervised without delay;(d) that immediate information about the nature and extent of the emergency is given to the crew on the installation and to the competent authority;(e) that the competent authority is constantly informed about the progress of combating the emergency;(f) that at all times sufficient and most appropriate materials and equipment, including stand-by boats and aircraft, are available to put into effect the emergency plan;(g) that the most appropriate methods and techniques are known to the specialized crew referred to in annex vi, paragraph (c), in order to combat leakages, spillages, accidental discharges, fire, explosions, blow-outs and any other threat to human life or the environment;(h) that the most appropriate methods and techniques are known to the specialized crew responsible for reducing and preventing long-term adverse effects on the environment;(i) that the crew is thoroughly familiar with the operator's contingency plan, that periodic emergency exercises are held so that the crew has a thorough working knowledge of the equipment and procedures and that each individual knows exactly his role within the plan.2. the operator shall cooperate, on an institutional basis, with other operators or entities capable of rendering necessary assistance, so as to ensure that, in cases where the magnitude or nature of an emergency creates a risk for which assistance is or might be required, such assistance can be rendered.b. national coordination and directionthe competent authority for emergencies of a contracting party shall ensure:(a) the coordination of the national contingency plan and/ or procedures and the operator's contingency plan and control of the conduct of actions, especially in case of significant adverse effects of the emergency;(b) direction to the operator to take any action it may specify in the course of preventing, abating or combating pollution or in the preparation of further action for that purpose, including placing an order for a relief drilling rig, or to prevent the operator from taking any specified action;(c) the coordination of actions in the course of preventing, abating or combating pollution or in preparation for further action for that purpose within the national jurisdiction with such actions undertaken within the jurisdiction of other states or by international organizations;(d) collection and ready availability of all necessary information concerning the existing activities;(e) the provision of an up-to-date list of the persons and entities to be alerted and informed about an emergency, its development and the
