countries;realizing the importance and ecological, cultural and socio-economic value of mountain regions, which prompted the united nations general assembly to declare 2002 the international year of mountains; recognizing the importance of mountain areas, as enshrined in chapter 13 (sustainable mountain development) of the declaration on environment and development ("agenda 21", rio de janeiro, 1992), and in the plan of implementation of the world summit on sustainable development;recalling the declaration on environment and sustainable development in the carpathian and danube region
