199 PROTOCOL to the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, 1972 and resolutions adopted by the special meetingsrc: the contracting parties to this protocol,stressing the need to protect the marine environment and to promote the sustainable use and conservation of marine resources,noting in this regard the achievements within the framework of the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, 1972 and especially the evolution towards approaches based on precaution and prevention,noting further the contribution in this regard by complementary regional and national instruments which aim to protect the marine environment and which take account of specific circumstances and needs of those regions and states,reaffirming the value of a global approach to these matters and in particular the importance of continuing co-operation and collaboration between contracting parties in implementing the convention and the protocol,recognizing that it may be desirable to adopt, on a national or regional level, more stringent measures with respect to prevention and elimination of pollution of the marine environment from dumping at sea than are provided for in international conventions or other types of agreements with a global scope,taking into account relevant international agreements and actions, especially the united nations convention on the law of the sea, 1982, the rio declaration on environment and development and agenda 21,recognizing also the interests and capacities of developing states and in particular small island developing states,being convinced that further international action to prevent, reduce and where practicable eliminate pollution of the sea caused by dumping can and must be taken without delay to protect and preserve the marine environment and to manage human activities in such a manner that the marine ecosystem will continue to sustain the legitimate uses of the sea and will continue to meet the needs of present and future generations,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of this protocol:1. "convention" means the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, 1972, as amended.2. "organization" means the international maritime organization.3. "secretary-general" means the secretary-general of the organization.4. .1. "dumping" means:1. any deliberate disposal into the sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;2. any deliberate disposal into the sea of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;3. any storage of wastes or other matter in the seabed and the subsoil thereof from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea; and4. any abandonment or toppling at site of platforms or other man-made structures at sea, for the sole purpose of deliberate disposal.2.

reduction of amenities ARTICLE 2objectivescontracting parties shall individually and collectively protect and preserve the marine environment from all sources of pollution and take effective measures, according to their scientific, technical and economic capabilities, to prevent, reduce and where practicable eliminate pollution caused by dumping or incineration at sea of wastes or other matter. where appropriate, they shall harmonize their policies in this regard ARTICLE 3general obligations1. in implementing this protocol, contracting parties shall apply a precautionary approach to environmental protection from dumping of wastes or other matter whereby appropriate preventative measures are taken when there is reason to believe that wastes or other matter introduced into the marine environment are likely to cause harm even when there is no conclusive evidence to prove a causal relation between inputs and their effects.2. taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, each contracting party shall endeavour to promote practices whereby those it has authorized to engage in dumping or incineration at sea bear the cost of meeting the pollution prevention and control requirements for the authorized activities, having due regard to the public interest.3. in implementing the provisions of this protocol, contracting parties shall act so as not to transfer, directly or indirectly, damage or likelihood of damage from one part of the environment to another or transform one type of pollution into another.4. no provision of this protocol shall be interpreted as preventing contracting parties from taking, individually or jointly, more stringent measures in accordance with international law with respect to the prevention, reduction and where practicable elimination of pollution ARTICLE 4dumping of wastes or other matter1. .1. contracting parties shall prohibit the dumping of any wastes or other matter with the exception of those listed in annex 1.2. the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in annex 1 shall require a permit. contracting parties shall adopt administrative or legislative measures to ensure that issuance of permits and permit conditions comply with provisions of annex 2. particular attention shall be paid to opportunities to avoid dumping in favour of environmentally preferable alternatives.2. no provision of this protocol shall be interpreted as preventing a contracting party from prohibiting, insofar as that contracting party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter mentioned in annex 1. that contracting party shall notify the organization of such measures ARTICLE 5incineration at seacontracting parties shall prohibit incineration at sea of wastes or other matter ARTICLE 6export of wastes or other mattercontracting parties shall not allow the export of wastes or other matter to other countries for dumping or incineration at sea ARTICLE 7internal waters1. notwithstanding any other provision of this protocol, this protocol shall relate to internal waters only to the extent provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3.2. each contracting party shall at its discretion either apply the provisions of this protocol or adopt other effective permitting and regulatory measures to control the deliberate disposal of wastes or other matter in marine internal waters where such disposal would be "dumping" or "incineration at sea" within the meaning of article 1, if conducted at sea.3. each contracting party should provide the organization with information on legislation and institutional mechanisms regarding implementation, compliance and enforcement in marine internal waters. contracting parties should also use their best efforts to provide on a voluntary basis summary reports on the type and nature of the materials dumped in marine internal waters ARTICLE 8exceptions1. the provisions of articles 4.1 and 5 shall not apply when it is necessary to secure the safety of human life or of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in cases of force majeure caused by stress of weather, or in any case which constitutes a danger to human life or a real threat to vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, if dumping or incineration at sea appears to be the only way of averting the threat and if there is every probability that the damage consequent upon such dumping or incineration at sea will be less than would otherwise occur. such dumping or incineration at sea shall be conducted so as to minimize the likelihood of damage to human or marine life and shall be reported forthwith to the organization.2. a contracting party may issue a permit as an exception to articles 4.1 and 5, in emergencies posing an unacceptable threat to human health, safety, or the marine environment and admitting of no other feasible solution. before doing so the contracting party shall consult any other country or countries that are likely to be affected and the organization which, after consulting other contracting parties, and competent international organizations as appropriate, shall, in accordance with article 18.6 promptly recommend to the contracting party the most appropriate procedures to adopt. the contracting party shall follow these recommendations to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the time within which action must be taken and with the general obligation to avoid damage to the marine environment and shall inform the organization of the action it takes. the contracting parties pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations.3 . any contracting party may waive its rights under paragraph 2 at the time of, or subsequent to ratification of, or accession to this protocol ARTICLE 9issuance of permits and reporting1 . each contracting party shall designate an appropriate authority or authorities to:1. issue permits in accordance with this protocol;2. keep records of the nature and quantities of all wastes or other matter for which dumping permits have been issued and where practicable the quantities actually dumped and the location,

thousand nine hundred and ninety-six ANNEX 1wastes or other matter thatmay be considered for dumping1. the following wastes or other matter are those that may be considered for dumping being mindful of the objectives and general obligations of this protocol set out in articles 2 and 3:1. dredged material;2. sewage sludge;3. fish waste, or material resulting from industrial fish processing operations;4. vessels and platforms or other man-made structures at sea;5. inert, inorganic geological material;6. organic material of natural origin; and7. bulky items primarily comprising iron, steel, concrete and similarly unharmful materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations, such as small islands with isolated communities, having no practicable access to disposal options other than dumping.2. the wastes or other matter listed in paragraphs 1.4 and 1.7 may be considered for dumping, provided that material capable of creating floating debris or otherwise contributing to pollution of the marine environment has been removed to the maximum extent and provided that the material dumped poses no serious obstacle to fishing or navigation.3. notwithstanding the above, materials listed in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.7 containing levels of radioactivity greater than de minimis (exempt) concentrations as defined by the iaea and adopted by contracting parties, shall not be considered eligible for dumping; provided further that within 25 years of 20 february 1994, and at each 25 year interval thereafter, contracting parties shall complete a scientific study relating to all radioactive wastes and other radioactive matter other than high level wastes or matter, taking into account such other factors as contracting parties consider appropriate and shall review the prohibition on dumping of such substances in accordance with the procedures set forth in article 22 ANNEX 2assessment of wastes or other matter that may be considered for dumpinggeneral1. the acceptance of dumping under certain circumstances shall not remove the obligations under this annex to make further attempts to reduce the necessity for dumping.waste prevention audit2. the initial stages in assessing alternatives to dumping should, as appropriate, include an evaluation of:1. types, amounts and relative hazard of wastes generated;2. details of the production process and the sources of wastes within that process; and3. feasibility of the following waste reduction/prevention techniques:1. product reformulation;2. clean production technologies;3. process modification;4. input substitution; and5. on-site, closed-loop recycling.3. in general terms, if the required audit reveals that opportunities exist for waste prevention at source, an applicant is expected to formulate and implement a waste prevention strategy, in collaboration with relevant local and national agencies, which includes specific waste reduction targets and provision for further waste prevention audits to ensure that these targets are being met. permit issuance or renewal decisions shall assure compliance with any resulting waste reduction and prevention requirements.4. for dredged material and sewage sludge, the goal of waste management should be to identify and control the sources of contamination. this should be achieved through implementation of waste prevention strategies and requires collaboration between the relevant local and national agencies involved with the control of point and non-point sources of pollution. until this objective is met, the problems of contaminated dredged material may be addressed by using disposal management techniques at sea or on land.consideration of waste management options5. applications to dump wastes or other matter shall demonstrate that appropriate consideration has been given to the following hierarchy of waste management options, which implies an order of increasing environmental impact:1. re-use;2. off-site recycling;3. destruction of hazardous constituents;4. treatment to reduce or remove the hazardous constituents; and5. disposal on land, into air and in water.6. a permit to dump wastes or other matter shall be refused if the permitting authority determines that appropriate opportunities exist to re-use, recycle or treat the waste without undue risks to human health or the environment or disproportionate costs. the practical availability of other means of disposal should be considered in the light of a comparative risk assessment involving both dumping and the alternatives.chemical, physical and biological properties7. a detailed description and characterization of the waste is an essential precondition for the consideration of alternatives and the basis for a decision as to whether a waste may be dumped. if a waste is so poorly characterized that proper assessment cannot be made of its potential impacts on human health and the environment, that waste shall not be dumped.8. characterization of the wastes and their constituents shall take into account:1. origin, total amount, form and average composition;2. properties: physical, chemical, biochemical and biological;3. toxicity;4. persistence: physical, chemical and biological; and5. accumulation and biotransformation in biological materials or sediments.action list9. each contracting party shall develop a national action list to provide a mechanism for screening candidate wastes and their constituents on the basis of their potential effects on human health and the marine environment. in selecting substances for consideration in an action list, priority shall be given to toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative substances from anthropogenic sources (e.g., cadmium, mercury, organohalogens, petroleum hydrocarbons, and, whenever relevant, arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, beryllium, chromium, nickel and vanadium, organosilicon compounds, cyanides, fluorides and pesticides or their by-products other than organohalogens). an action list can also be used as a trigger mechanism for further waste prevention considerations.10. an action list shall specify an upper level and may also specify a lower level. the upper level should be set so as to avoid acute or chronic effects on human health or on sensitive marine organisms representative of the marine ecosystem. application of an action list will result in three possible categories of waste:1. wastes which contain specified substances, or which cause biological responses, exceeding the relevant upper level shall not be dumped, unless made acceptable for dumping through the use of management techniques or processes;2. wastes which contain specified substances, or which cause biological responses, below the relevant lower levels should be considered to be of little environmental concern in relation to dumping; and3. wastes which contain specified substances, or which cause biological responses, below the upper level but above the lower level require more detailed assessment before their suitability for dumping can be determined.dump-site selection11. information required to select a dump-site shall include:1. physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the water-column and the seabed;2. location of amenities, values and other uses of the sea in the area under consideration;3. assessment of the constituent fluxes associated with dumping in relation to existing fluxes of substances in the marine environment; and4. economic and operational feasibility.assessment of potential effects12. assessment of potential effects should lead to a concise statement of the expected consequences of the sea or land disposal options, i.e., the "impact hypothesis". it provides a basis for deciding whether to approve or reject the proposed disposal option and for defining environmental monitoring requirements.13. the assessment for dumping should integrate information on waste characteristics, conditions at the proposed dump-site(s), fluxes, and proposed disposal techniques and specify the potential effects on human health, living resources, amenities and other legitimate uses of the sea. it should define the nature, temporal and spatial scales and duration of expected impacts based on reasonably conservative assumptions.14. an analysis of each disposal option should be considered in the light of a comparative assessment of the following concerns: human health risks, environmental costs, hazards, (including accidents), economics and exclusion of future uses. if this assessment reveals that adequate information is not available to determine the likely effects of the proposed disposal option then this option should not be considered further. in addition, if the interpretation of the comparative assessment shows the dumping option to be less preferable, a permit for dumping should not be given.15. each assessment should conclude with a statement supporting a decision to issue or refuse a permit for dumping.monitoring16. monitoring is used to verify that permit conditions are met - compliance monitoring - and that the assumptions made during the permit review and site selection process were correct and sufficient to protect the environment and human health - field monitoring. it is essential that such monitoring programmes have clearly defined objectives.permit and permit conditions17. a decision to issue a permit should only be made if all impact evaluations are completed and the monitoring requirements are determined. the provisions of the permit shall ensure, as far as practicable, that environmental disturbance and detriment are minimized and the benefits maximized. any permit issued shall contain data and information specifying:1. the types and sources of materials to be dumped;2. the location of the dump-site(s);3. the method of dumping; and4. monitoring and reporting requirements.18. permits should be reviewed at regular intervals, taking into account the results of monitoring and the objectives of monitoring programmes. review of monitoring results will indicate whether field programmes need to be continued, revised or terminated and will contribute to informed decisions regarding the continuance, modification or revocation of permits. this provides an important feedback mechanism for the protection of human health and the marine environment ANNEX 3arbitral procedure ARTICLE 11. an arbitral tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the "tribunal") shall be established upon the request of a contracting party addressed to another contracting party in application of article 16 of this protocol. the request for arbitration shall consist of a statement of the case together with any supporting documents.2. the requesting contracting party shall inform the secretary-general of:1. its request for arbitration; and2. the provisions of this protocol the interpretation or application of which is, in its opinion, the subject of disagreement.3. the secretary-general shall transmit this information to all contracting states ARTICLE 21. the tribunal shall consist of a single arbitrator if so agreed between the parties to the dispute within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration.2. in the case of the death, disability or default of the arbitrator, the parties to a dispute may agree upon a replacement within 30 days of such death, disability or default ARTICLE 31. where the parties to a dispute do not agree upon a tribunal in accordance with article 2 of this annex, the tribunal shall consist of three members:1. one arbitrator nominated by each party to the dispute; and2. a third arbitrator who shall be nominated by agreement between the two first named and who shall act as its chairman.2. if the chairman of a tribunal is not nominated within 30 days of nomination of the second arbitrator, the parties to a dispute shall, upon the request of one party, submit to the secretary-general within a further period of 30 days an agreed list of qualified persons. the secretary-general shall select the chairman from such list as soon as possible. he shall not select a chairman who is or has been a national of one party to the dispute except with the consent of the other party to the dispute.3. if one party to a dispute fails to nominate an arbitrator as provided in paragraph 1.1 within 60 days from the date of receipt of the request for arbitration, the other party may request the submission to the secretary-general within a period of 30 days of an agreed list of qualified persons. the secretary-general shall select the chairman of the tribunal from such list as soon as possible. the chairman shall then request the party which has not nominated an arbitrator to do so. if this party does not nominate an arbitrator within 15 days of such request, the secretary-general shall, upon request of the chairman, nominate the arbitrator from the agreed list of qualified persons.4. in the case of the death, disability or default of an arbitrator, the party to the dispute who nominated him shall nominate a replacement within 30 days of such death, disability or default. if the party does not nominate a replacement, the arbitration shall proceed with the remaining arbitrators. in the case of the death, disability or default of the chairman, a replacement shall be nominated in accordance with the provision of paragraphs 1.2 and 2 within 90 days of such death, disability or default.5. a list of arbitrators shall be maintained by the secretary-general and composed of qualified persons nominated by the contracting parties. each contracting party may designate for inclusion in the list four persons who shall not necessarily be its nationals. if the parties to the dispute have failed within the specified time limits to submit to the secretary-general an agreed list of qualified persons as provided for in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, the secretary-general shall select from the list maintained by him the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet nominated ARTICLE 4the tribunal may hear and determine counter-claims arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute ARTICLE 5each party to the dispute shall be responsible for the costs entailed by the preparation of its own case. the remuneration of the members of the tribunal and of all general expenses incurred by the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute. the tribunal shall keep a record of all its expenses and shall furnish a final statement thereof to the parties ARTICLE 6any contracting party which has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the case may, after giving written notice to the parties to the dispute which have originally initiated the procedure, intervene in the arbitration procedure with the consent of the tribunal and at its own expense. any such intervenor shall have the right to present evidence, briefs and oral argument on the matters giving rise to its intervention, in accordance with procedures established pursuant to article 7 of this annex, but shall have no rights with respect to the composition of the tribunal ARTICLE 7a tribunal established under the provisions of this annex shall decide its own rules of procedure ARTICLE 81. unless a tribunal consists of a single arbitrator, decisions of the tribunal as to its procedure, its place of meeting, and any question related to the dispute laid before it, shall be taken by majority vote of its members. however, the absence or abstention of any member of the tribunal who was nominated by a party to the dispute shall not constitute an impediment to the tribunal reaching a decision. in case of equal voting, the vote of the chairman shall be decisive.2. the parties to the dispute shall facilitate the work of the tribunal and in particular shall, in accordance with their legislation and using all means at their disposal:1. provide the tribunal with all necessary documents and information; and2. enable the

tribunal from reaching a decision and rendering an award ARTICLE 9the tribunal shall render its award within five months from the time it is established unless it finds it necessary to extend that time limit for a period not to exceed five months. the award of the tribunal shall be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision. it shall be final and without appeal and shall be communicated to the secretary-general who shall inform the contracting parties. the parties to the dispute shall immediately comply with the award.
