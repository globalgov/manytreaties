Where a fishing licence is renewed during the period in which this Protocol applies, the new fishing licence must contain a clear reference to the initial fishing licence. The Union shall forward the fishing licence to the vessel owner or to their agent. If the Union offices are closed, Cape Verde may issue the fishing licence directly to the vessel owner or their agent with a copy to the Union. 6. List of vessels licensed to fish Once the fishing licence is issued, Cape Verde shall draw up immediately for each category of vessel the final list of vessels which are licensed to fish in the Cape Verdean zone. This list shall be sent immediately to the national body responsible for monitoring fishing and to the Union and shall replace the provisional list referred to in point 4. 7. Period of validity of the fishing licence Fishing licences shall be valid for one year and be renewable. In order to establish the start of the period of validity, one year shall mean: (i) for the first year of application of the Protocol, the period between the date of its entry into force and 31 December of the same year; (ii) then, each complete calendar year; (iii) for the last year of application of the Protocol, the period between 1 January and the date of expiry of this Protocol. 8. Keeping the fishing licence on board The fishing licence must be kept on board at all times. However, vessels shall be permitted to fish as soon as they are included on the provisional list referred to in point 4. Vessels must keep the provisional list on board until their fishing licence is issued. 9. Transfer of a fishing licence A fishing licence shall be issued for a given vessel and shall not be transferable. However, where force majeure is proven, for example in the event of the loss or prolonged immobilisation of a vessel due to a serious technical failure, and at the request of the Union, the fishing licence shall be replaced by a new licence, issued for another similar vessel or a substitute vessel. The transfer shall involve the fishing licence to be replaced being returned by the vessel owner or their agent in Cape Verde, and Cape Verde drawing up the replacement licence as soon as possible. The replacement licence shall be issued without further delay to the vessel owner or their agent when the licence to be replaced is returned. The replacement licence shall take effect on the day on which the licence to be replaced is returned. Cape Verde shall update the list of vessels licensed to fish as soon as possible. The new list shall be sent without delay to the national body responsible for supervising fishing, and to the Union. 10. Support vessels Cape Verde shall authorise fishing vessels to be assisted by support vessels, subject to adoption by Cape Verde of legislation regulating the activity of such vessels. CHAPTER III TECHNICAL CONSERVATION MEASURES Technical measures applicable to vessels holding a fishing licence with respect to fishing zones, fishing gear and by-catch are laid down for each category of fishing in the technical sheets in Appendix 2. The vessels shall comply with all the recommendations adopted by the ICCAT. In line with ICCAT’s recommendations, the parties shall endeavour to reduce the level of by-catches of turtles, seabirds and other non-target species. The Union vessels shall release any such by-catches in the interest of increasing the chance of survival of the species concerned. CHAPTER IV CATCH REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS 1. Fishing logbook The master of a Union vessel fishing under the Agreement shall keep a fishing logbook, for which the model for each category of fishing is included in Appendix 4. The fishing logbook shall be completed by the master for each day the vessel is present in the Cape Verdean fishing zone. Each day the master shall record in the fishing logbook the quantity of each species, identified by its FAO alpha 3 code, caught and kept on board, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish. For each main species, the master shall also include the bad catch. Where applicable, the master shall also record each day in the fishing logbook the quantities of each species thrown back into the sea, expressed in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish. The fishing logbook shall be filled in legibly, in block capitals, and signed by the master. The master shall be responsible for the accuracy of the data recorded in the fishing logbook. 2. Catch reporting The master shall declare the vessel’s catch by submitting to Cape Verde its fishing logbooks for the period of its presence in the Cape Verdean fishing zone. The fishing logbooks shall be transmitted in one of the following ways: (i) when passing through a Cape Verdean port, the original of each fishing logbook shall be submitted to the local representative of Cape Verde, who shall confirm receipt thereof in writing; (ii) when leaving the Cape Verdean fishing zone without first passing through a Cape Verdean port, the original of each fishing logbook shall be sent within a period of 14 days after arrival in any other port, and in any case within a period of 30 days after leaving the Cape Verdean zone: (a) by letter sent to Cape Verde; (b) by fax, to the number given by Cape Verde; or (c) by e-mail. As soon as Cape Verde is able to receive catch declarations by e-mail, the master shall send the fishing logbooks to Cape Verde at the e-mail address given by Cape Verde. Cape Verde shall confirm receipt thereof immediately by return e-mail. For tuna-fishing vessels and surface longliners, the master shall also send a copy of all the fishing logbooks to one of the following scientific institutes: (i) Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD); (ii) Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO); (iii) Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfèra (IPMA); or (iv) Instituto Nacional de Desenvolvimento das Pescas (INDP). The return of the vessel into the Cape Verdean zone within the period of validity of its fishing licence shall give rise to further catch reporting. Where the provisions concerning catch reporting are not complied with, Cape Verde may suspend the fishing licence of the vessel concerned until the missing catch report is obtained and penalise the vessel owner in accordance with the relevant provisions under the national legislation in force. If the offence is repeated, Cape Verde may refuse to renew the fishing licence. Cape Verde shall inform the Union immediately of any penalty applied in this context. 3. Transition to an electronic system The parties agree to establish an electronic logbook and a system for electronic reporting of catch data (ERS) in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Appendix 6. The parties shall establish together the details of how this system is to be implemented, with the aim of making it operational from 1 September. 2015. 4. Final statement of fees for tuna-fishing vessels and surface longliners Until the electronic system provided for under point 3 is in place, the Member States shall inform the European Commission, by no later than 15 June each year of the tonnages caught during the past year, as confirmed by the scientific institutes referred to in point 2. For each tuna-fishing vessel and surface longliner, the Union shall draw up, on the basis of its catch reporting, a final statement of the fees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season for the previous calendar year. The Union shall send this final statement to Cape Verde and to the vessel owner via the Member States before 31 July of the year in progress. From the date the electronic system provided for under point 3 becomes operational, the Union shall draw up for each pole-and-line tuna vessel, tuna seiner and surface longliner, on the basis of the logbooks archived at the Fisheries Monitoring Center (FMC) of the flag State, a final statement of the fees owed by the vessel in respect of its annual season for the previous calendar year. The Union shall send this final statement to Cape Verde and to the vessel owner before 31 March of the year in progress. In both cases Cape Verde may, within 30 days of the day it was sent, contest the final statement on the basis of documentary proof. In the case of disagreement, the parties shall consult each other in the Joint Committee. If Cape Verde does not object within 30 days, the final statement shall be considered to be adopted. Where the final statement exceeds the anticipated flat-rate fee paid to obtain the fishing licence, the vessel owner shall pay the outstanding balance to Cape Verde by 30 September of the year in progress. Where the final statement is less than the anticipated flat-rate fee, the remaining amount may not be reclaimed by the vessel owner. CHAPTER V LANDINGS AND TRANSHIPMENTS 1. Notification The master of a Union vessel wishing to land in a Cape Verdean port, or to tranship catch from the Cape Verdean zone, must notify Cape Verde, at least 24 hours before the landing or transhipment, of the following: (a) the name of the fishing vessel which is to land or tranship; (b) the port of landing or transhipment; (c) the date and time scheduled for the landing or transhipment; (d) the quantity (expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish) of each species to be landed or transhipped (identified by its FAO alpha 3 code); (e) in the case of transhipment, the name of the receiving vessel; (f) the health certificate of the receiving vessel. Any transhipment operation must be carried out in the waters of a Cape Verdean port authorised for this purpose. Transhipment at sea is prohibited. Non-compliance with these provisions shall lead to imposition of the relevant penalties provided for under Cape Verdean legislation. 2. Landing incentives In order to contribute to the development of Cape Verde’s fishing industry and enhance the economic and social impact of the Agreement, in particular in the area of fish processing and adding value to fishery products, the parties shall consult each other with a view to drawing up a strategy aimed at increasing the rate of landings by the Union fleet. Owners of vessels fishing for tuna shall endeavour to land part of their catches from Cape Verdean waters. The landed catch may be sold to local enterprises at a price set by negotiation between the operators. The implementation of the strategy aimed at increasing the rate of landings and the good working order of the port and processing infrastructure shall be subject to regular monitoring by the Joint Committee, following consultation of the operators concerned. Where Union vessels holding a fishing licence under this Protocol land tuna catches in a Cape Verdean port, they shall be granted a reduction in the fee of EUR 10 per tonne landed. An additional reduction of EUR 10 per tonne shall be granted where fishery products are sold to a Cape Verdean processing factory. This mechanism shall apply for up to a maximum of 50 % of the final catch statement. Proof of the landing and/or sale shall be sent to the Directorate-General for Fisheries. Once these documents have been approved, the vessel owners concerned will be informed by the Union of the amounts to be refunded to them. The amounts shall be deducted from the fees due for future licence applications. CHAPTER VI CHECKS 1. Entering and leaving the zone Any entry into or departure from the Cape Verdean fishing zone of a Union vessel holding a fishing licence must be notified to Cape Verde within six hours of the entry or departure. When notifying its entry or exit, the vessel shall mention in particular: (i) the date, time and point of passage scheduled; (ii) the quantity of each species held on board, identified by its FAO alpha 3 code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish; (iii) the presentation of the products. Notification shall be given preferably by e-mail or, failing that, by fax or radio, to an e-mail address, a telephone number or a frequency given by Cape Verde. Cape Verde shall immediately inform the vessels concerned and the Union of any change to the e-mail address, telephone number or transmission frequency. Any vessel found to be fishing in the Cape Verdean zone without having previously notified its presence shall be considered to be an unlicensed fishing vessel. 2. Inspection at sea Inspections at sea in the Cape Verdean zone of Union vessels holding a fishing licence shall be carried out by vessels and inspectors of Cape Verde who are clearly identified as being assigned to carry out fishing checks. Before going on board, the Cape Verdean inspectors shall inform the Union vessel of their decision to carry out an inspection. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection. The Cape Verdean inspectors shall only stay on board the Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out tasks linked to the inspection. They shall carry out the inspection in a way which minimises the impact on the vessel, its fishing activity and cargo. Cape Verde may authorise the Union to participate in the inspection at sea as an observer. The master of the Union vessel shall allow the Cape Verdean inspectors to come on board and carry out their work. At the end of each inspection, the Cape Verdean inspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the Union vessel shall have the right to make comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the Union vessel. The Cape Verdean inspectors shall give a copy of the inspection report to the master of the Union vessel before leaving the vessel. Cape Verde shall send a copy of the inspection report to the Union within a period of eight days after the inspection. 3. Inspection in port Inspections in port of Union vessels landing or transhipping their catch from the Cape Verdean zone in the waters of a Cape Verdean port shall be carried out by Cape Verdean inspectors who are clearly identified as being assigned to carry out fishing checks. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection. The Cape Verdean inspectors shall only stay on board the Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out the tasks related to the inspection and shall conduct the inspection in such a way as to minimise the impact on the vessel, the landing or transhipment operation and the cargo. Cape Verde may authorise the Union to participate in the inspection in port as an observer. The master of the Union vessel shall allow the Cape Verdean inspectors to carry out their work. At the end of each inspection, the Cape Verdean inspector shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the Union vessel shall have the right to make comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the Union vessel. The Cape Verdean inspector shall give a copy of the inspection report to the master of the Union vessel at the end of the inspection. Cape Verde shall send a copy of the inspection report to the Union within a period of eight days after the inspection. CHAPTER VII SATELLITE MONITORING SYSTEM (VMS) 1. Vessel position messages - VMS system Whilst they are in the Cape Verdean zone, Union vessels holding a fishing licence must be equipped with a satellite monitoring system (Vessel Monitoring System - VMS) to enable automatic and continuous communication of their position, at all times, to the FMC of their flag State. Each position message must contain: (a) the vessel identification; (b) the most recent geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a position error of less than 500 metres, and with a confidence interval of 99 %; (c) the date and time the position is recorded; (d) the speed and the course of the vessel; and (e) comply with the format set out in Appendix 5. The first position recorded after entry into the Cape Verdean zone shall be identified by the code ’ENT’. All subsequent positions shall be identified by the code ’POS’, with the exception of the first position recorded after departure from the Cape Verdean zone, which shall be identified by the code ’EXI’. The FMC of the flag State shall ensure the automatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the position messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner and kept for a period of three years. 2. Transmission by the vessel in the event of breakdown of the VMS The master shall ensure at all times that the VMS of his vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are correctly transmitted to the FMC of the flag State. In the event of breakdown, the VMS of the vessel shall be repaired or replaced within one month. After that period, the vessel shall no longer be permitted to fish in the Cape Verdean zone. Vessels fishing in the Cape Verdean zone with a defective VMS must send their position messages by e-mail, radio or fax to the FMC of the flag State, at least every four hours, and must provide all the compulsory information. 3. Secure communication of the position messages to Cape Verde The FMC of the flag State shall automatically send the position messages of the vessels concerned to the FMC of Cape Verde. The FMCs of the flag State and Cape Verde shall exchange their contact e-mail addresses and inform each other without delay of any change to these addresses. The transmission of position messages between the FMCs of the flag State and Cape Verde shall be carried out electronically using a secure communication system. The FMC of Cape Verde shall inform the FMC of the flag State and the Union of any interruption in the receiving of consecutive position messages from a vessel holding a fishing licence, where the vessel concerned has not notified its departure from the zone. 4. Malfunction of the communication system Cape Verde shall ensure the compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag State and inform the Union immediately of any malfunction as regards the sending and receiving of position messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as possible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any possible dispute arising. The master shall be considered responsible for any proven tampering with a vessel’s VMS aimed at disturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringement shall be subject to the penalties provided for by the Cape Verdean legislation in force. 5. Revision of the frequency of position messages On the basis of documentary evidence proving an infringement, Cape Verde may ask the FMC of the flag State, copying in the Union, to reduce the interval for sending position messages from a vessel to every 30 minutes for a set period of investigation. This documentary evidence must be sent by Cape Verde to the FMC of the flag State and the Union. The FMC of the flag State shall immediately send position messages to Cape Verde at the new frequency. At the end of the set investigation period, Cape Verde shall inform the FMC of the flag State and the Union of any follow-up which is required. CHAPTER VIII INFRINGEMENTS 1. Handling of infringements Any infringement committed by a Union vessel holding a fishing licence under this Annex must be mentioned in an inspection report. The signature of the inspection report by the master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner’s right of defence in respect of the alleged infringement. 2. Detention of a vessel - information meeting Where the Cape Verdean legislation in force so provides with regard to the alleged infringement, the Union vessel concerned may be forced to cease its fishing activity and, where the vessel is at sea, to return to a Cape Verdean port. Cape Verde shall notify the Union within one working day of any detention of a Union vessel holding a fishing licence. The notification must be sent together with elements justifying the detention. Before taking any measure against the vessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed at protecting evidence, Cape Verde shall organise, at the request of the Union, within one working day of notification of the detention of the vessel, an information meeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel being detained and to explain what further action may be taken. A representative of the vessel’s flag State may attend this information meeting. 3. Penalties for infringements - compromise procedure The penalty for the alleged infringement shall be set by Cape Verde according to the provisions of the national legislation in force. Where settling the infringement involves legal proceedings, provided that the infringement does not involve a criminal act, a compromise procedure shall be launched between Cape Verde and the Union before the legal proceedings are instigated with a view to determining the terms and level of the penalty. A representative of the vessel’s flag State may participate in this compromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall finish at the latest three days after notification of the vessel’s detention. 4. Legal proceedings - bank security If the compromise procedure fails and the infringement is brought before the competent court, the owner of the vessel which committed the infringement shall deposit a bank security at a bank designated by Cape Verde, the amount of which, as set by Cape Verde, covers the costs linked to the detention of the vessel, the estimated fine and any compensation. The bank security may not be released until the legal proceedings have been concluded. he bank security shall be released and returned to the vessel owner without delay after the judgment has been delivered: (a) in full, if no penalty has been imposed; (b) for the amount of the remaining balance, if the penalty is a fine which is lower than the amount of the bank security. Cape Verde shall inform the Union of the outcome of the legal proceedings within eight days of the judgement being delivered. 5. Release of the vessel and the crew The vessel and its crew shall be permitted to leave the port once the penalty has been paid in a compromise procedure, or once the bank security has been deposited. CHAPTER IX SIGNING-ON OF SEAMEN 1. Number of seamen to sign on During their fishing season in the Cape Verdean zone, the Union vessels shall sign on Cape Verdean seamen, subject to the following limits: (a) the tuna seiner fleet shall sign on at least six seamen; (b) the pole-and-line tuna fleet shall sign on at least two seamen; (c) the surface longliner fleet shall sign on at least five seamen. The owners of the Union vessels shall endeavour to sign on additional Cape Verdean seamen. 2. Free choice of seamen Cape Verde shall hold a list of Cape Verdean seamen qualified to be signed on for Union vessels. The vessel owner, or their agent, shall choose freely from the list of Cape Verdean seamen to be signed on and shall notify Cape Verde of their inclusion in the crew. 3. Seamen’s contracts The employment contract for Cape Verdean seamen shall be drawn up by the vessel owner or their agent and the seaman, represented by their union, if necessary. It shall be signed by the Cape Verdean maritime authority. It shall stipulate in particular the date and port of signing on. The contract shall guarantee the seaman the social security cover applicable to him in Cape Verde. It shall include life assurance and sickness and accident insurance. A copy of the contract shall be given to the signatories. The basic working rights laid down in the declaration of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) shall be afforded to Cape Verdean seamen. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 4. Seamen’s wages The wages of the Cape Verdean seamen shall be paid by the vessel owner. They shall be set before the fishing licence is issued by mutual agreement between the vessel owner or their agent and Cape Verde. The wages shall not be lower than those of crews on national vessels, nor the level determined by the ILO. 5. Seamen’s obligations The seaman shall report to the master of the vessel to which he has been appointed the day before the signing-on date stipulated in the contract. The master shall inform the seaman of the date and time of signing on. If the seaman withdraws or does not present himself at the date and time stipulated for his signing on, his contract will be considered to be null and void and the vessel owner will be automatically discharged from their obligation to sign him on. In this case the vessel owner shall not be liable to pay any financial penalty or compensation payment. 6. Failure to sign on Cape Verdean seamen Owners of vessels which fail to sign on Cape Verdean seamen shall be required to pay, before 30 September of the year in progress, for each seaman above the number set at the start of this Chapter, a flat rate of EUR 20 for each day their vessels are present in the Cape Verdean zone. CHAPTER X CAPE VERDEAN OBSERVERS 1. Observation of fishing activities Vessels holding a fishing licence shall be subject to a scheme for observing their fishing activities carried out under the Agreement. This observation scheme shall conform to the provisions provided for in the recommendations adopted by the ICCAT. 2. Designated vessels and observers Cape Verde shall designate the Union vessels which must allow an observer on board and the observer assigned to them at the latest 15 days before the scheduled boarding date. When the fishing licence is issued, Cape Verde shall inform the Union and the vessel owner, or their agent, of the designated vessels and observers and the times at which the observer will be present on board each vessel. Cape Verde shall immediately inform the Union and the vessel owner or their agent of any change in the designated vessels and observers. Cape Verde shall endeavour not to designate observers for vessels which already have an observer on board, or which are already formally obliged to allow an observer on board during the fishing season in question as part of their activities in fishing zones other than the Cape Verdean zone. The observers shall not spend more time on board the vessel than is necessary to carry out their duties. 3. Flat rate financial contribution At the time the fee is paid, the vessel owner shall pay Cape Verde a flat rate sum of EUR 200 per year for each vessel. 4. Observer’s salary The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by the Cape Verdean authorities. 5. Conditions on board The conditions under which the observer is taken on board, in particular the duration of their presence, shall be defined by mutual agreement between the vessel owner or their agent and Cape Verde. An observer shall be treated on board as an officer. However, the observer’s accommodation must take account of the vessel’s technical structure. The vessel owner shall bear the costs of providing accommodation and food for the observer on board. The master shall take all the measures within his area of responsibility that are required to ensure the observer’s physical safety and general wellbeing. The observer shall be provided with every facility needed to carry out their duties. He shall have access to means of communication and to documents relating to the fishing activities of the vessel, in particular the fishing logbook and navigation log, and the parts of the vessel directly linked to their duties. 6. Observer’s obligations Whilst on board the observer shall: (a) take all appropriate measures so as not to interrupt or hinder fishing operations; (b) respect on-board property and equipment; (c) respect the confidential nature of any document belonging to the vessel. 7. Observer’s boarding and leaving the vessel The observer shall be taken on board in a port chosen by the vessel owner. The vessel owner or their agent shall inform Cape Verde, with a notice period of 10 days before the observer is taken on board, of the date and time and the port where the observer will be taken on board. Where the observer is taken on board in a foreign country, their travel costs to the port of boarding shall be borne by the vessel owner. If the observer does not present himself for boarding within 12 hours of the date and time set, the vessel owner shall be automatically discharged from their obligation to allow the observer on board. The vessel shall be free to leave the port and start fishing operations. Where the observer is not set ashore in a Cape Verdean port, the vessel owner shall bear the costs of repatriating the observer to Cape Verde as soon as possible. 8. Observer’s duties The observer shall carry out the following duties: (a) observe the fishing activities of the vessel; (b) verify the position of the vessel during fishing operations; (c) perform biological sampling in the context of a scientific programme; (d) note the fishing gear used; (e) verify the catch data for the Cape Verdean zone recorded in the logbook; (f) verify the percentages of by-catches and estimate the discarded catches; (g) send their observations by radio, fax or e-mail at least once a week while the vessel is fishing in the Cape Verdean zone, including the quantity of catches and by-catches on board. 9. Observer’s report Before leaving the vessel, the observer shall submit a report with his observations to the master of the vessel. The master shall have the right to make comments in the observer’s report. The report shall be signed by the observer and the master. The master shall receive a copy of the observer’s report. The observer shall send his report to Cape Verde, which shall send a copy of it to the Union within eight days of setting the observer ashore. CHAPTER XI OPERATOR LIABILITY 1. The operator shall ensure that its vessels are seaworthy and contain adequate life safety equipment and survival gear for each passenger and member of the crew. 2. The operator must have appropriate and complete insurance cover for their vessel, provided by a recognised international insurer. 3. Where a Union vessel is involved in a marine accident or incident in Cape Verde that causes pollution or any other kind of environmental damage, the vessel and its operator shall immediately inform the Cape Verdean authorities. If the damage observed is caused by the vessel belonging to the operator, the latter shall assume their responsibility under the relevant national and international provisions and procedures.
