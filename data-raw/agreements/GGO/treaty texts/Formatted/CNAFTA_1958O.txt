MULTILATERAL Agreement on the r√©gime for Central American integration industries. Signed at Tegucigalpa on 10 June 1958 The Governments of the Republic of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Having regard to the objectives of the Central American Economic Integration Programme which was undertaken through the Central American Economic Co-operation Committee and, in particular, to article XXI of the Multilateral Treaty on Free Trade and Central American Economic Integra tion, 2 Desirous of strengthening the natural and traditional bonds of brother hood which unite their countries, and of co-operating towards the solution of their common economic problems, Having as their basic aim the improvement of the living standards of the Central American peoples and the rational use, for that purpose, of their natural resources, and being convinced that, within the economic develop ment programmes of the Central American Isthmus, the integration of their economies offers favourable prospects for the expansion of trade between their countries and for a more rapid industrialization process on the basis of mutual interest, who, having exchanged their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows: ARTICLE I The Contracting States undertake to encourage and promote the establish ment of new industries and the specialization and expansion of existing industries within the framework of Central American economic integration, and agree that the development of the various activities which are or may be included in such a programme shall be effected on a reciprocal and equitable basis in order that each and every Central American State may progressively derive economic advantages. ARTICLE II The Contracting States declare their interest in the development of industries with access to a common Central American market. These shall be designated Central American integration industries and shall be so declared jointly by the Contracting States, through the agency of the Central American Industrial Integration Commission established in conformity with article VIII of this Agreement. The Contracting States shall regard as Central American integration industries those industries which, in the judgement of the Central American Industrial Integration Commission, comprise one or more plants which require access to the Central American market in order to operate under reasonably economic and competitive conditions even at minimum capacity. ARTICLE III The application of the present Regime to the Central American integration industries is subject to signature by the Contracting States, in respect of each of the said industries, of an additional protocol stipulating: (a) The country or countries in which the industrial plants covered by this Regime are to be initially situated, the minimum capacity of the said plants and the conditions under which additional plants are to be subsequently admitted into the same or other countries; (b) The quality standards for the products of the said industries and any other requirements that may be deemed convenient for the protection of the consumer; (c) The regulations that may be advisable as regards the participation of Central American capital in the enterprises owning the plants ; (d) The common Central American tariffs which shall be applied to the products of Central American integration industries; and (e) Any other provisions designed to ensure the attainment of the objectives of this Agreement. Article IV The products of plants which form part of a Central American integration industry and which are covered by the present Regime, shall enjoy the benefits of free trade between the territories of the Contracting States. The products of plants which form part of the same industry but which are not covered by the Regime, shall enjoy in the Contracting States successive annual reductions of ten per cent in the applicable uniform Central American tariff, from the date specified in the relevant additional protocol. As from the tenth year, such products shall enjoy the full benefits of free trade. Except as provided in the preceding paragraph and in any other provisions of this Agreement or of the additional protocols, all trade in commodities produced by the Central American integration industries shall be governed by the provisions of the Multilateral Treaty on Free Trade and Central American Economic Integration Treaty. Article V In conformity with the provisions of article IV of the Multilateral Treaty on Free Trade and Central American Economic Integration, the Central American Trade Commission shall give priority consideration to the equalization of the customs duties and other charges levied upon imports of commodities that are similar to or substitutes for the commodities produced by the Central American integration industries covered by the additional protocols to this Agreement, as well as upon imports of raw materials and of the containers necessary for their production and distribution. Article VI Since the Contracting States intend to grant to the Central American integration industries ample fiscal incentives, the enterprises owning industrial plants covered by the present Regime shall enjoy, in the territory of the countries where such plants are or may be established, the benefits and exemptions prescribed by the national legislation of the country concerned. Article VII Except in cases of emergency, the Governments of the Contracting States shall not grant customs duty exemptions or reductions below the Central American common tariff on any imports from countries outside Central America of goods which are equal or similar to or substitutes for goods manufactured in any of the Central American countries by plants of industrial integration industries, nor shall they apply to such imports preferential exchange rates equivalent to such exemptions or reductions. The Governments and other State bodies shall also give preference in their official imports to the products of the Central American integration industries. ARTICLE VIII In order to ensure due application of this Agreement and of the additional protocols, the Contracting States agree to establish a Central American Industrial Integration Commission, to which each of the Contracting States shall appoint a special representative; the Commission shall meet as frequently as its work may require or at the request of any of the Contracting States. The Commission or any of its members may travel freely in the Contracting States in order to study matters within the Commission's competence in the field, and the authorities of the Contracting States shall provide them with whatever information and facilities may be necessary for the proper discharge of their functions. The Commission shall have a permanent secretariat which shall be under the responsibility of the General Secretariat of the Organization of Central American States. The Commission shall adopt its rules of procedure unanimously and shall prescribe the regulations relating to the conduct of matters within its competence, in particular the regulations relating to the conditions and form in which, in each specific case, the views of private enterprise shall be heard. ARTICLE IX Individuals or bodies corporate desiring the incorporation of a given plant into the present Regime shall present an application to that effect to the Secretariat of the Central American Industrial Integration Commission and accompany it with the required information.When the Secretariat has sufficient information available, it shall advise the Commission of the application. If the Commission finds that the project meets the aims of this Agreement, the application shall be referred to for an opinion to the Central American Research Institute for Industry or to any other person or body that the Commission considers competent. Such opinion shall take into account the technological and economic aspects of the project and, in particular, the market prospects, and the costs incurred shall be borne by the interested parties. The Commission shall decide on the project on the basis of the said opinion, and if it finds the project capable of being realized, shall make whatever recommendations it considers pertinent to the Governments of the Contracting States on the conclusion of the protocol covering the industry concerned and on the conditions to be stipulated. When the project refers to a plant which forms part of an industry already covered by a protocol, the Commission may, in conformity with the terms of the relevant protocol and of this article, declare that the plant shall be admitted to the benefits of the present Regime and advise to that effect the Governments of the Contracting States. ARTICLE X The Central American Industrial Integration Commission shall submit an annual report on its activities to the Contracting States. The Commission shall periodically carry out studies with a view to enabling the Governments to evaluate the results of the application of the present Regime. The Commission may propose to the Contracting States measures favourable to the development of the Central American integration industries and to the efficient functioning of their plants. The Commission may also propose to the Governments any measures necessary to resolve any problems arising from the application of this Agreement. ARTICLE XI The Contracting States agree to settle amicably, in the spirit of this Agreement, any differences which may arise in the interpretation or application of any of its provisions or of the additional protocols. If agreement cannot be reached, they shall submit the matter to arbitration. For the purpose of constituting the arbitral tribunal, each Contracting State shall propose to the General Secretariat of the Organization of Central American States the names of three judges from its Supreme Court of Justice. From the complete list of candidates, the Secretary-General of the Organization of Central American States and the Government representatives in the Organization shall select, by drawing lots, a tribunal composed of five arbitrators, no two of whom may be nationals of the same State. The award of the arbitral tribunal shall require the concurring votes of not less than three members and shall be binding on all the Contracting States so far as it contains any ruling concerning the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Agreement and of the additional protocols. ARTICLE XII This Agreement shall be submitted for ratification in each Contracting State in conformity with its respective constitutional or legislative procedures. This Agreement shall come into force on the date of deposit of the last instrument of ratification. It shall remain in force for twenty years and shall be tacitly renewable for successive periods of ten years.

If a Contracting State gives notice of withdrawal after the prescribed time limit but before a new period of validity has commenced, such notification shall be valid, but the Agreement shall remain in force for two further years after the beginning of the new period. In the event of denunciation of this Agreement, the same shall remain in force as regards its additional protocols until the expiry of the latter. Should a Contracting State denounce this Agreement, the other Contracting States shall determine whether the Agreement shall cease to have effect between all the Contracting States or whether it shall be maintained between such Contracting States as have not denounced it. The additional protocols to this Agreement shall be approved in conformity with the constitutional or legislative procedures of each country.

The tariffs shall be applied 30 days after the date on which written notice as aforesaid has been given. ARTICLE 34 Whenever the system established by virtue of the foregoing provisions is apt to give rise to speculative imports of foreign goods, the Executive Council, at the request of any of the Contracting Parties, may decide whether the countries should impose restrictions or quotas on the import of such goods at any time before the production thereof is to begin in Central America. The Governments shall act in conformity with resolutions adopted by the Council.

ARTICLE 37 The Executive Council shall keep a close check on the prices of the goods coming under the special system. If it finds that these prices are excessively high in relation to the normal market prices of similar goods, it may, on the basis of a study to be carried out for this purpose by the Permanent Secretariat in co-operation with the Central American Research Institute for Industry (ICAITI), grant authorization for imports to be subject to the payment of the uniform tariffs agreed upon in the Central American Agreement on the Equalization of Import Duties and Charges and its protocols or, in the absence thereof, of the national tariffs in effect on the date on which the present Protocol is signed. The Council may authorize imports in the amounts required to meet such shortage as, on the basis of a study carried out for this purpose by the Permanent Secretariat, the Council shall itself have determined, such imports to be subject to payment of the tariffs referred to in the preceding paragraph.
