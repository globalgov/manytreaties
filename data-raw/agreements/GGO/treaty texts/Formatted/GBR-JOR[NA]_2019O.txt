Objectives 1. The overriding objective of this Agreement is to preserve the links between the Parties established by the association created in Article 1 of the EU-Jordan Association Agreement. 2. In particular, the Parties agree to preserve the preferential conditions relating to trade between the Parties which resulted from the EU-Jordan Association Agreement and to provide a platform for further trade liberalisation between the Parties. 3. For the avoidance of doubt, it is confirmed that the Parties establish an association as well as a free trade area in goods and associated rules in accordance with this Agreement and affirm the objectives in Article 1 of the EU-Jordan Association Agreement and Article 1 of the EU-Jordan Dispute Settlement Mechanism Protocol. ARTICLE 2. Definitions and Interpretation 1. Throughout this Instrument: (a) the "EU-Jordan Agreements" means the Agreements defined in Article 3; (b) the "Incorporated Agreements" means the provisions of the EU-Jordan Agreements as incorporated into this Agreement (and related expressions are to be read accordingly); and (c) "mutatis mutandis" means with the technical changes necessary to apply the EU-Jordan Agreements as if they had been concluded between the United Kingdom and Jordan, taking into account the object and purpose of this Agreement. 2. Throughout the Incorporated Agreements and this Instrument, "this Agreement" means this Instrument and the Incorporated Agreements. 3.

ARTICLE 4. References to European Union Law 1. Except as otherwise provided, references in this Agreement to European Union law are to be read as references to that European Union law in force as incorporated or implemented in United Kingdom law as retained European Union law on the day after the United Kingdom ceases to be bound by the relevant European Union law. 2. In this Article "United Kingdom law" includes the law of the territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible to whom this Agreement extends, as set out in Article 6. ARTICLE 5. References to the Euro Notwithstanding Article 3, references to the euro (including "EUR" and "â‚¬") in the Incorporated Agreements shall continue to be read as such in this Agreement. ARTICLE 6. Territorial Application 1. For the avoidance of doubt in relation to incorporated Article 105, this Agreement shall apply, in respect of the United Kingdom, to the extent that and under the conditions which the EU-Jordan Agreements applied immediately before they ceased to apply to the United Kingdom, to the United Kingdom and the following territories for whose international relations it is responsible: (a) Gibraltar; and (b) the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, and Article 11 of this Instrument, this Agreement shall apply to those territories for whose international relations the United Kingdom is responsible from the date of written notification by the United Kingdom to Jordan of application of this Agreement to those territories. ARTICLE 7. Continuation of Time Periods 1. Unless this Instrument provides otherwise: (a) if a period in the EU-Jordan Agreements has not yet ended, the remainder of that period shall be incorporated into this Agreement; and (b) if a period in the EU-Jordan Agreements has ended, any ongoing right or obligation in the EU-Jordan Agreements shall apply between the Parties and that period shall not be incorporated into this Agreement. 2.

ARTICLE 8. Further Provision In Relation to the Association Council and the Association Committee 1. The Association Committee which the Parties establish under incorporated Article 92 shall ensure that this Agreement operates properly. 2. Upon entry into force of this Agreement, any decisions adopted by the Association Council or the Association Committee established by the EU-Jordan Association Agreement before the EU-Jordan Agreements ceased to apply to the United Kingdom shall, to the extent those decisions relate to the Parties to this Agreement, be deemed to have been adopted, mutatis mutandis, and subject to the provisions of this Instrument, by the Association Council or the Association Committee established under incorporated Articles 89 and 92 of the EU-Jordan Association Agreement, respectively. 3. Nothing in paragraph 2 prevents the Association Council or the Association Committee making decisions which modify, are different to, revoke or supersede the decisions deemed to have been adopted by it under that paragraph. ARTICLE 9. Integral Parts of this Agreement The Annexes and Footnotes to this Instrument are integral to this Agreement. ARTICLE 10. Amendments 1.
