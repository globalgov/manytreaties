Title I. TRADE COOPERATION ARTICLE 1. In the field of trade cooperation, the object of this Convention is to promote trade between the ACP States and the Community, taking account of their respective levels of development, and also between the ACP States themselves. In the pursuit of this objective, particular regard will be had to the need to secure effective additional benefits for the trade of the ACP States with the Community, in order to accelerate the growth of their trade and in particular of the flow of their exports to the Community and in order to improve the conditions of access for their products to the market of the Community, so as to ensure a better balance in the trade of the Contracting Parties. To this end the Contracting Parties shall apply the provisions of this Title and the other appropriate measures under Titles V, VI and VU. Chapter 1. Trade Arrangements ARTICLE 2. 1. Products originating in the ACP States shall be imported into the Community free of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect. 2. (a) Products originating in the ACP States: - listed in Annex II to the Treaty when they come under a common organization of the market within the meaning of Article 40 of the Treaty, or - subject, on import into the Community, to specific rules introduced as a result of the implementation of the common agricultural policy, shall be imported into the Community notwithstanding the general arrangements applied in respect of third countries, in accordance with the following provisions: (i) those products shall be imported free of customs duties for which Community provisions in force at the time of import do not provide, apart from customs duties, for the appplication of any other measure relating to their import; (ii) for products other than those referred to under (i), the Community shall take the necessary measures to ensure more favourable treatment than that granted to third countries benefiting from the most-favoured-nation clause for the same products. (b) If, during the application of this Convention, the ACP States request that new lines of agricultural production or agricultural products which are not the subject of specific arrangements upon the entry into force of this Convention should benefit from such arrangements, the Community shall examine these requests in consultation with the ACP States. (c) The arrangements referred to in subparagraph (a) shall enter into force at the same time as this Convention and shall remain applicable for its duration. If, however, during the application of this Convention, the Community: - subjects one or more products to common organization of the market or to specific rules introduced as a result of the implementation of the common agricultural policy, it reserves the right to adapt the import treatment for these products originating in the ACP States, following consultations within the Council of Ministers. In such cases, the provisions of subparagraph (a) shall be applicable, - modifies the common organization of the market in a particular product or the specific rules introduced as a result of the implementation of the common agricultural policy, it reserves the right to modify the arrangements laid down for products originating in the ACP States, following consultations within the Council of Ministers. In such cases, the Community undertakes to ensure that products originating in the ACP States continue to enjoy an advantage comparable to that previously enjoyed in relation to products originating in third countries benefiting from the most-favoured-nation clause. (d) Where the Community envisages concluding a preferential agreement with third States it shall inform the ACP States thereof. Consultations shall take place, where the ACP States so request in order to safeguard their interests. ARTICLE 3. 1. The Community shall not apply to imports of products originating in the ACP States any quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect. 2. Paragraph 1, however, shall not prejudice the import treatment applied to the products referred to in the first indent of Article 2 (2) (a). The Community shall inform the ACP States when residual quantitative restrictions are eliminated in respect of any of these products. ARTICLE 4. The provisions of this chapter shall not preclude any commitments which the Contracting Parties might have to enter into within the framework of International Community Agreements. Consultations shall take place on this subject when Contracting Parties envisage concluding such Agreements with a view to taking into consideration the respective interests of all the Contracting Parties. ARTICLE 5. 1. The provisions of Article 3 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals and plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archeological value or the protection of industrial and commercial property. 2. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not in any case constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade generally. 3. In cases where the implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 affect the interests of one or more ACP States, consultations shall be held at the request of the latter with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution. ARTICLE 6. The treatment applied to imports of products originating in the ACP States may not be more favourable than that applied to trade among the Member States. ARTICLE 7. Where new measures or measures stipulated in programmes adopted by the Community for the approximation of laws and regulations in order to facilitate the movement of goods are likely to affect the interests of one or more ACP States the Community shall, prior to adopting such measures, inform the ACP States thereof through the Council of Ministers. In order to enable the Community to take into consideration the interests of the ACP States concerned, consultations shall be held at the request of the latter with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution. ARTICLE 8. 1. Where existing rules or regulations of the Community adopted in order to facilitate the movement of goods affect the interests of one or more ACP States or where these interests are affected by the interpretation, application or administration of such rules or regulations, consultations shall be held at the request of the ACP States concerned with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution. 2, With a view to finding a satisfactory solution, the ACP States may also bring up within the Council of Ministers any other problems relating to the movement of goods which might result from measures taken or envisaged by the Member States. 3. The competent institutions of the Community shall to the greatest possible extent inform the Council of Ministers of such measures. ARTICLE 9. 1. In view of their present development needs, the ACP States shall not be required for the duration of this Convention to assume in respect of imports of products originating in the Community, obligations corresponding to the commitments entered into by the Community in respect of imports of the products originating in the ACP States, under this Chapter. 2. (a) In their trade with the Community, the ACP States shall not discriminate among the Member States, and shall grant to the Community treatment no less favourable than the most-favoured-nation treatment. (b) The most-favoured-nation treatment referred to in subparagraph (a) shall not apply in respect of trade or economic relations between ACP States or between one or more ACP States and other developing countries. ARTICLE 10. Unless it has already done so under the terms of the ACP-EEC Convention of Lom√©, each Contracting Party shall communicate its customs tariff to the Council of Ministers within a period of three months following the entry into force of this Convention. Each Contracting Party shall also communicate any subsequent amendments to its tariff as and when they come into force. ARTICLE 11. 1. The concept of "originating products" for the purposes of implementing this chapter, and the methods of administrative cooperation relating thereto, are defined in Protocol 1. 2. The Council of Ministers may adopt any amendment to Protocol 1. 3. Where the concept of "originating products" has not yet been defined for a given product in implementation of paragraph 1 or 2, each Contracting Party shall continue to apply its own rules. ARTICLE 12. 1. If, as a result of applying the provisions of this Chapter, serious disturbances occur in a sector of the economy of the Community or of one or more of its Member States, or jeopardize their external financial stability, or if difficulties arise which may result in a deterioration in a sector of the economy of the Community or of a region thereof, the Community may take, or may authorize the Member State concerned to take, safeguard measures. These measures, their duration and their methods of application shall be notified immediately to the Council of Ministers. 2. The Community and its Member States undertake not to use safeguard measures or other means for protectionist purposes or to hamper structural development. 3. These safeguard measures shall be restricted to those which would least disturb trade between the Contracting Parties in implementing the objectives of the Convention and must not exceed the scope of what is strictly necessary to remedy the difficulties that have arisen. 4. Safeguard measures shall, at the time of their application, take account of the existing level of the ACP exports concerned to the Community and their potential for development. ARTICLE 13. 1. Prior consultations shall take place concerning the application of the safeguard clause, both when such measures are first adopted and when such measutes are extended. The Community shall provide the ACP States with all the information necessary for such consultations and shall provide the necessary data from which to determine to what extent imports from an ACP State or ACP States of a specific product have caused the effects mentioned in Article 12 (1). 2. Where consultations have taken place, safeguard measures, or arrangements jointly agreed upon by the ACP States concerned and the Community, shall enter into force thereafter. 3. However, the prior consultations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not prevent any immediate decisions which the Community or its Member States, in accordance with Article 12 (1), might take where special factors have necessitated these decisions. 4. In order to facilitate the examination of facts that may cause market disturbances a mechanism shall be instituted designed to ensure statistical surveillance of certain ACP exports to the Community. 5. The Contracting Parties undertake to hold regular consultations with the view to finding satisfactory solutions to problems which might result from the application of the safeguard clause. ARTICLE 14. The Council of Ministers shall, at the request of any Contracting Party concerned, consider the economic and social effects of the application of the safeguard clause. ARTICLE 15. When safeguard measures are being taken, modified or removed, particular attention will be paid to the interests of the least-developed, fand-locked and island ACP States. ARTICLE 16. In order to ensure effective implementation of the provisions of this Convention in the field of trade cooperation, the Contracting Parties agree to inform and consult each other. In addition to the cases for which consultations are specifically provided in Articles 1 to 15, consultations shall also take place, at the request of the Community or of the ACP States, and in accordance with the conditions provided for in the rules of procedure in Article 168, particularly in the following cases: 1. where Contracting Parties envisage taking any trade measures affecting the interests of one or more Contracting Parties under this Convention, they shall inform the Council of Ministers thereof. Consultations shall take place, where the Contracting Parties concerned so request, in order to take account of their respective interests; 2. if, during the application of this Convention, the ACP States consider that agricultural products covered by Article 2 (2) (a) other than those subject to special treatment should benefit from such treatment, consultations may take place within the Council of Ministers; 3. where a Contracting Party considers that obstacles to the movement of goods arise as a result of the existing rules of another Contracting Party or the interpretation, application or administration thereof; 4. where the Community envisages concluding a preferential agreement with third States, it shall inform the ACP States thereof. Consultations shall take place, where the ACP States so request, in order to safeguard their interests; 5. where the Community or the Member States take safeguard measures in accordance with Article 12, consultations on these measures may take place within the Council of Ministers, where the Contracting Parties concerned so request, notably with a view to ensuring compliance with Article 12 (3).

With a view to attaining the objectives set in Article 1, the Contracting Parties shall implement trade promotion measures from the production stage to the final stage of distribution. The object is to ensure that the ACP States derive maximum benefit from the provisions of this Convention in the fields of trade, agricultural and industrial cooperation and can participate under the most favourable conditions in the Community, domestic, regional and international markets by diversifying the range and increasing the value and volume of ACP exports. ARTICLE 21. The trade promotion measures provided for in Article 20 shall include the provision of technical and financial assistance for achieving the following objectives: (a) the establishment and/or improvement of the structure of organizations, centres or firms involved in the development of the trade of ACP States and the assessment of their staffing requirements, financial management and working methods; (b) basic training, management training, and vocational training of technicians in fields related to the development and promotion of national and international trade; (c) product policy inclusive of research, processing, quality guarantee and control, packaging and presentation; (d) development of supportive infrastructure, including transport and storage facilities, in order to facilitate the flow of exports from ACP States; (e) advertising; (f) establishing, promoting and improving cooperation among economic operators in ACP States and between such operators and those in the Member States of the Community and in third countries and introducing appropriate measures to promote such cooperation; (g) carrying out and making use of market research and marketing studies; (h) collecting, analysing and disseminating quantitative and qualitative trade information and facilitating free access to existing or future information systems or bodies in the Community and in the ACP States; (i) participation by the ACP States in fairs, exhibitions and, in particular, specialized international shows, the list of which shall be drawn up in consultation with the ACP States, and the organization of trade events; (j) special assistance to small- and medium-sized undertakings for product identification and development, market outlets and joint marketing ventures; (k) the participation of the least-developed ACP States in the various trade promotion activities envisaged shall be encouraged by special provisions inter alia the payment of travel expenses of personnel and costs of transporting articles and goods that are to be exhibited, on the occasion of their participation in fairs and exhibitions.

Title II. EXPORT EARNINGS FROM COMMODITIES Chapter 1. Stabilization of Export Earnings ARTICLE 23. 1. With the aim of remedying the harmful effects of the instability of export earnings and to help the ACP States overcome one of the main obstacles to the stability, profitability and sustained growth of their economies, to support their development efforts and to enable them in this way to ensure economic and social progress for their peoples by helping to safeguard their purchasing power, a system shall be operated to guarantee the stabilization of earnings derived from the ACP States' exports to the Community of products on which their economies are dependent and which are affected by fluctuations in price or quantity or both these factors. 2. In order to attain these objectives, transfers must be devoted to maintaining financial flows in the sector in question or, for the purpose of promoting diversification, directed towards other appropriate sectors and used for economic and social development. ARTICLE 24. Export earnings to which the stabilization system applies shall be those accruing from the export by each ACP State to the Community of each of the products on the following list, in the drawing up of which account has been taken of factors such as employment, deterioration of the terms of trade between the Community and the ACP State concerned and the level of development of that ACP State. ARTICLE 25. 1. The following products shall be covered: 2. Exports of iron ores (ores, concentrates, roasted iron pyrites) from sites being worked when this Convention is signed shall be covered by Articles 23 to 47 for a period limited to the first five financial years of this system. Upon expiry of that period, iron ore shall be wholly covered by Articles 49 to 59. 3. Upon presentation of each transfer request the ACP State shall choose between the following systems: (a) each product listed in Article 25 (1) shall constitute a product within the meaning of Article 27 and 44 (b) product groups 1 and 2, 3 to5, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 10 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 19 and 20 to 22 shall each constitute a product within the meaning of Articles 27, 29, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43 and 44. ARTICLE 26. If, 12 months after the entry into force of this Convention, one or more products not contained in the list in Article 25, but upon which the economies of one or more ACP States depend to a considerable extent, are affected by sharp fluctuations, the Council of Ministers shall decide, not later than six months after the presentation of a request by the ACP State or States concerned, whether or not to include the said product or products in the list. ARTICLE 27. If so requested by one or more ACP States in respect of one or more of the products listed in Article 25, the Council of Ministers may decide, on the basis of a report established by the Commission of the European Communities, hereinafter referred to as "the Commission", in liaison with the requesting ACP State or States, to apply the system to exports of the products in question from the said ACP State or States to other ACP States. ARTICLE 28. Each ACP State concerned shall certify that the products to which the system applies have originated in its territory within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol 1. ARTICLE 29. The system shall apply to the earnings derived from an ACP State's exports of the products listed in Article 25 if, during the year preceding the year of application, earnings from the export of each product to all destinations, re-exports excluded, represented at least 6-5 % of its total export earnings from their goods. The percentage shall be 5 % for sisal. ARTICLE 30. 1. The system shall be implemented in respect of the products listed in Article 25 where they are: (a) released for home use in the Community, or (b) brought under the inward processing arrangements there in order to be processed. 2. The statistics used to implement the system shall be: (a) those obtained by cross-checking Community and ACP State statistics, account being taken of fob values, or (b) those obtained by multiplying the unit values for the exports of the ACP State in question, as given in that ACP State's statistics, by the quantities imported by the Community, as shown in Community statistics. 3. When submitting the transfer request for each product, the requesting ACP State shall choose one of the two systems set out above. ARTICLE 31. For the purposes specified in Article 23, the Community shall allocate to the system, for the duration of this Convention, an amount of $50 million EUA to cover all its commitments under the system. This amount shall be managed by the Commission. ARTICLE 32. 1. The overall amount referred to in Article 31 shall be divided into a number of equal annual instalments corresponding to the number of years of application. 2. Whatever balance remains at the end of each of the first four years of application of the Convention shall be carried forward automatically to the following year. ARTICLE 33. The resources available for each year of application are made up of the sum of the following elements: 1. the annual instalment, reduced by any amounts used under Article 34 (1); 2. the sums carried forward under Article 32 (2); 3. the amounts replenished under Articles 42 and 43; 4. any amounts made available under Article 34 (1). ARTICLE 34. In the case of an insufficiency of funds for a year of application the Council of Ministers, on the basis of a report submitted to it by the Commission, may: 1. authorize, for each year except the last, the use in advance of a maximum of 20 % of the following year√¢s instalment; 2. reduce the amount of the transfers to be made. ARTICLE 35. Before the expiry of the period referred to in Article 31, the Council of Ministers shall decide on the use of any balance remaining from the overall amount established in Article 31, as well as on the conditions for further use of any amounts still to be replenished by the ACP States under Articles 42 and 43, following the expiry of the period referred to in Article 31. ARTICLE 36. 1. In order to implement the system -a reference level shall be calculated for each ACP State and for each product. 2. This reference level shall correspond to the average of export earnings in the four years preceding each year of application. 3. Where, however, an ACP State: - starts processing a product traditionally exported in the raw state, or - begins exporting a product which it did not traditionally produce, the system may be put into operation on the basis of a reference level calculated on the three years preceding the year of application. ARTICLE 37. An ACP State shall be entitled to request a transfer if, on the basis of the results of a calendar year, its actual earnings, as defined in Article 30, from its exports of each product to the Community and, in the cases referred to in Article 27, to other ACP States or, in the cases referred to in Article 46 (3), to all destinations; are at least 6-5 % below the reference level. ARTICLE 38. 1. Requests for transfers shall be inadmissible in the following cases: (a) if the request is presented after 31 March of the year following the year of application; (b) if it emerges from the examination of the request, to be undertaken by the Commission in conjunction with the ACP State concerned, that the fall in earnings from exports to the Community is the result of a trade policy of that ACP State concerned advesely affecting exports to the Community in particular. 2. Requests for transfers may also be declared inadmissible if it emerges from the request, after consultations, that the requesting ACP State has recorded earnings from its exports to all destinations during the year of application in excess of the average of its export earnings to all destinations in the four years preceding the year of application for each product for which a request has been made. ARTICLE 39. 1. Every request for transfer shall be addressed to the Commission, which shall examine it in conjunction with the ACP State concerned. 2. The difference between the reference level and actual earnings, plus 1% for statistical errors and omissions, shall constitute the basis of the transfer. 3. Should examination of the trend of the requesting ACP State's exports to all destinations and of the production of the product in question and of demand in the Community reveal significant changes, consultations shall take place between the Commission and the requesting State to determine whether those changes are such as to affect the amount of the transfer, and if so to what extent. ARTICLE 40. 1. The Commission shall adopt a transfer decision on completion of the examination carried out in conjunction with the requesting ACP State. 2. For each transfer a transfer agreement shall be concluded between the Commission and the ACP State concerned. 3. The Commission and the ACP State concerned shall take such steps as are required to ensure that transfers are made rapidly. To that end, provision shall be made for the payment of advances. 4. The amounts transferred shall not bear interest. ARTICLE 41. 1. The recipient ACP State shall decide how the resources will be used, subject to compliance with the objectives laid down in Article 23. 2. During the examination of the request, and in any case before the transfer agreement is signed, the requesting ACP State shall give the Commission some indication of the probable use to which the transfer will be put. 3. Within the 12 months following the signing of the transfer agreement the recipient ACP State shall inform the Commission of the use to which the funds transferred have been put. ARTICLE 42. Subject to the provisions .of Article 46 (1) (c), ACP States which have received transfers shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 43, contribute during the seven years following the year in which the transfer was paid, to the replenishment of the resources made available for the system by the Community. ARTICLE 43. 1. Where the trend of the export earnings derived from the product which sustained the drop in export earnings that gave rise to the transfer so permits, the ACP State concerned shall help replenish the resources of the system. 2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Commission shall determine: - at the beginning of each year during the seven years following the year during which the transfer was paid, - until such time as the whole amount of the transfer has been paid back into the system, - in accordance with the provisions of Article 30, whether, for the preceding year: (a) the unit value of the product under consideration exported to the Community was higher than the average unit value during the four years prior to the preceding year; (b) the quantity of the same product actually exported to the Community was at least equal to the average of the quantities exported to the Community during the four years prior to the preceding year; (c) the earnings for the year and the product in question amount to at least 106-5 % of the average of earnings from exports to the Community during the four years prior to the preceding year. 3. If the three conditions set out in paragraph 2 are fulfilled simultaneously, the ACP State shall contribute to the system an amount equal to the difference between the actual earnings derived in the preceding year from exports to the Community and the average of earnings from exports to the Community during the four years prior to the preceding year, but in no case shall the amount of the contribution towards the replenishment of the resources of the system exceed the transfer in question. 4. This amount shall be contributed to the system at the rate of one fifth per year after a period of deferment of two years beginning in the year during which the obligation to contribute towards replenishment was established. 5. Should examination of the trend of exports to all destinations and of production of the product in question in the ACP State concerned as well as of demand in the Community reveal significant changes, consultations shall be held between the Commission and the ACP State concerned in order to establish whether these changes are such as to justify a contribution to the replenishment of the resources of the system, and if so to what extent. Where such justification exists, the ACP State shall contribute to the system, under the conditions set out in paragraph 4, the amount determined in the consultations. 6. On the basis of decisions taken by the Council of Ministers pursuant to Article 27, exports to other ACP States shall be added to the exports to the Community referred to in this Article. ARTICLE 44. If, on expiry of the seven-year period referred to in Article 42, the resources have not been fully replenished, the Council of Ministers, taking into consideration in particular the situation of and prospects for the balance of payments, exchange reserves and foreign indebtedness of the ACP State concerned, may decide that: - the sums outstanding are to be replenished wholly or partially, in one or more instalments, - rights to repayment are to be waived. ARTICLE 45. 1. In order to ensure that the stabilization system functions efficiently and rapidly, statistical and customs cooperation shall be instituted between each ACP State and the Commission. 2. The ACP States and the Commission shall adopt by mutual agreement any measures facilitating inter alia the exchange of necessary information, the submission of requests for transfers, the provision of information concerning the use of transfers, the implementation of the replenishment provisions and of any other aspect of the system by means of the widest possible use of standard forms. ARTICLE 46. 1. For the ACP: State listed in Article 155 (3) (a): (a) the percentage fixed in Article 29 shall be 2 %; (b) the percentage fixed in Article 37 shall be 2 %; (c) no contribution shall be required towards the replenishment of the resources made available to the system. 2. In the application of Articles 24, 34 and 37 the special difficulties of the ACP States referred to above shall be taken into account. 3. In the case of certain ACP States which do not send the bulk of their exports to the Community, the Council of Ministers may decide, by way of derogation from Articles 24 and 30, that the system shall apply to their exports of the products in question whatever their destination. The system shall then operate on the basis of the export statistics of the ACP State in question. ARTICLE 47. 1. For the ACP States listed in Article 155 (3) (b) and (c): (a) the percentage fixed in Article 29 shall be 2 %; (b) the percentage fixed in Article 37 shall be 2 %. 2. In the application of Article 24 the special difficulties of the above ACP States shall be taken into account. Chapter 2. Special Undertakings on Sugar ARTICLE 48. 1. In accordance with Article25 of the ACP-EEC Convention of Lom√© and with Protocol 3 annexed to that Convention, the Community has undertaken for an indefinite period, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, to purchase and import, at guaranteed prices, specific quantities of cane sugar, raw or white, which originates in the ACP States producing and exporting cane sugar and which those States have undertaken to deliver to it. 2.

This Article and the Protocol 3 referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to relations between the ACP States and the French overseas departments. Title III. MINERAL PRODUCTS Chapter 1. Project and Programme Aid ARTICLE 49. With a view to contributing towards the creation of a more solid basis for the development of the ACP States whose economies are largely dependent on the mining sectors and in particular towards helping them cope with a decline in their capacity to export mining products to the Community and the corresponding decline in their export earnings, a system shall be established to assist these States in their efforts to remedy the harmful effects on their income of serious temporary disruptions affecting those mining sectors and beyond the control of the ACP States concerned. ARTICLE 50. 1. The system laid down in Article 49 shall apply to the following products: - copper, including associated production of cobalt, - phosphates, - manganese, - bauxite and alumina, - tin, - roasted iron pyrites and iron ore, whether or not in agglomerate form (including pellets), excluding, during the period mentioned in Article 25 (2), the cases referred to in that Article. 2. If, not sooner than 12 months following the entry into force of this Convention, one or more products not contained in the above list, but upon which the economies of one or more ACP States depend to a considerable extent, are affected by serious disturbance, the Council of Ministers shall decide, not later than six months after the presentation of a request by the ACP State or States concerned, whether or not to include the said product or products in the list. ARTICLE 51. 1. For the purpose specified in Article 49, and for the period of application of this Convention, a special financing facility shall be set up to which the Community shall allocate an overall amount of 280 million EUA to cover all its commitments under this system. (a) This amount shall be managed by the Commission. (b) This overall amount shall be divided into a number of equal annual instalments corresponding to the number of years of application. Each year, except the last, the Council of Ministers, on the basis of a report submitted to it by the Commission, may authorize, where required, a maximum of 50 % of the following year's instalment to be used in advance. (c) Whatever balance remains at the end of each year of application of this Convention, except the last, shall be carried over automatically to the following year. (d) If the resources available for any year of application are insufficient, the amounts due shall be reduced accordingly. (e) The resources available for each year of application shall be made up of the following elements: - the annual instalment, reduced by any amounts used under (b) above, - the sums carried over under (c) above. 2. Before the expiry of the period referred to in Article 188, the Council of Ministers shali decide on the allocation of any balances remaining from the overall amount referred to in this Article. ARTICLE 52. 1. Possible recourse to the means of financing available under the special facility provided for in Article 51 shall be open to the countries eligible under Article 53 when, for a product covered by Article 50 and exported to the Community, a substantial fall is recorded, or can be expected over the following months, in their capacity to produce, or to export, or in their export earnings to such an extent as to seriously affect the development policy of the ACP State concerned by seriously compromising the profitability of an otherwise viable and economic line of production, thus preventing it from renewing at a normal rate or maintaining the production plant or export capacity. 2. The possible recourse referred to above shall also be available when a substantial fall in the production or export capacity is experienced, or is foreseen, owing to accidents and serious technical mishaps or grave political events, whether internal or external. 3. A substantial fall in production or export capacity shall be taken to mean 10 %. ARTICLE 53. 1. An ACP State which, during the preceding four years, has, as a general rule, derived at least 15 % of its export earnings from a product covered by Article 50 may apply for financial aid from the resources allocated to the special financing facility if the conditions laid down in Article $2 are fulfilled. 2. However, for the States listed in Article 155 (3), the figure stipulated in the first paragraph shall be 10 %. 3. The application for aid shall be made to the Commission, which shall examine it in conjunction with the ACP State concerned. The fact that the conditions have been fulfilled shall be established by common accord between the Community and the ACP State. Notification thereof by the Commission to the ACP State shall entitle the latter to Community aid from the special financing facility. ARTICLE 54. 1. The aid referred to in Article $3 shall be directed to the objectives defined in Article 49. 2. The amount of this aid to finance projects or programmes shall be determined by the Commission in the light of the funds available under the special financing facility, the nature of the projects or programmes proposed by the ACP States concerned and the possibilities for co-financing.

This amount shall comprise: 1. 4542 million EUA from the European Development Fund hereinafter referred to as "the Fund", allocated as follows: (a) for the purposes set out in Articles 91 and 92, 3 712 million EUA, consisting of: - 2928 million EUA in the form of grants, - 504 million EUA in the form of special loans, - 280 million EUA in the form of risk capital; (b) for the purposes set out in Title II, up to 550 million EUA in the form of transfers for the stabilization of export earnings; (c) for the purposes set out in Title III, Chapter 1, a special financing facility up to 280 million EUA; 2. for the purposes set out in Articles 91 and 92, up to 685 million EUA in the form of loans from the Bank, made from its own resources in accordance with the terms and conditions provided for in its Statute. These loans shall carry, under the conditions laid down in Article 104, a 3 % interest rate subsidy, the cost of which shall be charged against the amounts of aid provided for in 1 (a). ARTICLE 96. At the request of the ACP States and by consent of the parties the financial resources of the Community may be applied to co-financing, where that permits an increase in the financial flows to the ACP States and supports their efforts to harmonize international cooperation for their development. Special consideration shall be given in particular to: (a) large projects which cannot be financed by any one source of financing alone; (b) projects in which participation by the Community and input of its project expertise might facilitate the participation of other financing institutions; (c) projects for which diversification of financing might be advantageous, from the point of view of the terms of financing or the cost of the investment, and particularly projects of a social nature; (d) projects of a regional or inter-regional nature. ARTICLE 97. Co-financing may take the form of joint or parallel financing. Preference shall be given to the solution that is best from a cost and efficiency viewpoint. ARTICLE 98. With the agreement of the parties concerned, and without prejudice to the particular rules of each financing institution, necessary measures shall be taken to coordinate and harmonize operations of the Community and of the other co-financing bodies during the preparation and implementation of the project or programme being co-financed in order to avoid an increase in the number of procedures to be implemented by the ACP States and to allow those procedures to be made more flexible. ARTICLE 99. With the agreement of the ACP State concerned, the Community may provide the other co-financing bodies with administrative help, should they so desire, in order to facilitate the implementation of the project or programme being cofinanced. ARTICLE 100. At the request of the ACP State in question and with the agreement of the other parties concerned the Commission or the Bank may act as a leading or coordinating agency for projects part-financed by them. ARTICLE 101. 1. Projects or programmes may be financed by grant, or by special loan, or by risk capital, or by loans from the Bank from its own resources, or jointly by two or more of these means of financing. 2. The financing of productive investment projects in industry, agro-industry, tourism, mining and energy production linked with investment in those sectors shall be borne in the first place by loans from the Bank from its own resources and by risk capital. 3. For resources of the Fund which are managed by the Commission the means of financing shall be fixed jointly in accordance with the level of development and the geographical, economic and financial situation of the ACP State or States concerned, so as to ensure the best use of available resources. Account may also be taken of their economic and social impact. 4. For resources managed by the Bank, the means of financing shall be fixed in accordance with the nature of the project, the prospects for its economic and financial return and the stage of development and economic and financial situation of the ACP State or States concerned. Account shall be taken in addition of factors guaranteeing the servicing of repayable aid. ARTICLE 102. Special loans shall be made for a duration of 40 years, with a grace period of 10 years. They shall bear interest at the rate of 1 % per annum. ARTICLE 103. 1. Grants or special loans may be accorded to an ACP State or may be channelled by that State to a final recipient. 2. In the latter case, the terms on which the money may be made available, by the ACP State to the final recipient shall be laid down in the financing agreement. 3. Any profit accruing to the ACP State because it receives either a grant or a loan for which the interest rate or the repayment period is more favourable than that of the final loan shall be used by the ACP State for development purposes on the conditions laid down in the financing agreement. 4. Taking account of a request of the ACP State concerned, the Bank may, in accordance with Article 101, grant finance which it shall administer either directly to the final recipient, via a development bank, or via the ACP State concerned. ARTICLE 104. 1. Scrutiny by the Bank of eligibility of projects and the provision of loans from its own resources shall be effected in conjunction with the ACP State or States concerned in accordance with the rules, conditions and procedures provided for in the Bank's Statute and in this Convention, consideration being given to the economic and financial situation of the ACP State or States concerned and to the factors which guarantee the servicing of repayable aid. 2. The duration of loans made by the Bank from its own resources shall be governed by terms stipulated on the basis of the economic and financial characteristics of the project, but may not exceed 25 years. 3. The rate of interest shall be the rate charged by the Bank at the time of signing of each loan contract. This rate shall be reduced by 3 % by means of an interest rate subsidy, except where loans are intended for investment in the oil sector. This interest rate subsidy shall, however, be automatically adjusted so that the interest rate actually borne by the borrower will be neither less than 5 % nor more than 8 %. 4. The aggregate amount of interest rate subsidies, calculated in terms of its value at the time of the signature of the loan contract at a rate and according to detailed rules to be laid down by the Community, shall be charged against the amount of grant aid specified in Article 95 and shall be paid direct to the Bank. ARTICLE 105. 1. In order to enable projects to be carried out in industry, agro-industry, mining, tourism, and, in exceptional circumstances, transport and_ telecommunications, and in energy production linked with investment in those sectors, the Community may grant financial assistance in the form of risk capital where they are of general interest to the economy of the ACP State or States concerned. 2. Risk capital assistance may be used inter alia for: (a) increasing directly or indirectly the own resources or resources assimilated thereto of public, semi-public or private undertakings and granting quasi-capital assistance to such undertakings; (b) financing specific studies for the preparation and the drawing up of projects and providing assistance to undertakings during the start-up period; (c) financing research and investment in preparation for the launching of projects in the mining and energy sectors. 3. To attain these objectives the Community may acquire temporary minority holdings in the capital of the undertakings concerned or in that of institutions for financing development in the ACP States. Such holdings may be acquired in conjunction with a loan from the Bank or with another form of risk-capital assistance. As soon as the conditions are met they shall be transferred, preferably to nationals or institutions of the ACP States. 4. Quasi-capital assistance may also take the form of: (a) subordinated loans, which shall be redeemed and in respect of which interest, if any, shall be paid only after other bank claims have been settled; (b) conditional loans, the repayment or duration of which shall be governed by terms laid down when the loan is made. Conditional loans may be made directly, with the agreement of the ACP State concerned, to a given firm. They may also be granted to an ACP State or to institutions in the ACP States specializing in development financing to enable them to acquire a holding in the capital of undertakings operating in the sectors referred to in paragraph 1, where such an operation comes under the financing of preparatory or new productive investments and may be supplemented by other Community financing, possibly together with other sources of financing, as a co-financing operation; (c) loans made to development financing institutions in the ACP States, where the characteristics of their activities and management so permit. Such loans may be used for on lending to other firms and acquiring holdings in other undertakings. 5. The terms of the quasi-capital assistance referred to in paragraph 4 shall be determined case by case by reference to the characteristics of the projects financed. However, the terms on which quasi-capital assistance is granted shall generally be more favourable than those for subsidized loans from the Bank. The interest rate shall not be greater than that on subsidized loans. 6. Where the assistance referred to in this Article is granted to consultancy firms or is used to finance research or investment in preparation for the launching of a project, it may be incorporated in any capital assistance to which the promoting company may be entitled if the project is carried out. ARTICLE 106. 1. Special treatment shall be accorded to the least- developed ACP States when determining the volume of the financial resources which such States may expect from the Community for the purpose of their indicative programmes. In addition, account shall be taken of the particular difficulties of the land-locked or island ACP States. 2. These financial resources shall be combined with particularly favourable terms of financing, having regard to the economic situation and the nature of the needs specific to each State. They shall consist essentially of grants and, in appropriate cases, of special loans or risk capital. 3. Special loans for the least-developed ACP States shall be made for a duration of 40 years with a grace period of 10 years. They shall bear an interest rate of 0-75 % per annum. 4. The Community shall as a matter of priority facilitate access for the least-developed ACP States to risk capital assistance administered by the Bank. 5, Loans from the Bank's own resources may also be granted in the least-developed ACP States, having regard to the criteria laid down in Article 104. ARTICLE 107. At the request of the least-developed ACP States, the Community may, under the conditions laid down in Article 139 (4), lend assistance in studying solutions to their indebtedness, debt-servicing and balance-of- payments problems. Chapter 3. ACP and EEC Responsibilities ARTICLE 108. 1. Operations financed by the Community shall be implemented by the ACP States and the Community in close cooperation, the concept of equality between the partners being recognized. 2. The ACP States shall be responsible for: (a) defining the objectives and priorities on which the indicative programmes drawn up by them shall be based; (b) choosing the projects and programmes which they decide to put forward for Community financing; (c) preparing and presenting to the Community the dossiers of projects and programmes; (d) preparing, negotiating and concluding contracts; (e) implementing projects and programmes financed by the Community; (f) managing and maintaining operations carried out in the context of financial and technical cooperation. 3. If requested by the ACP States, the Community may provide them with technical assistance in performing the tasks referred to in paragraph 2. It shall examine in particular specific measures for alleviating the particular difficulties encountered by the least-developed, land-locked and island ACP States in the implementation of their projects and programmes. 4. The ACP States and the Community shall bear joint responsibility for: (a) defining, within the joint institutions, the gen√É¬©ral policy and guidelines of financial and technical cooperation; (b) adopting the indicative programmes of Community aid; (c) appraising projects and programmes, and examining the extent to which they fit the objectives and priorities and comply with the provisions of the Convention; (d) taking the necessary implementing measures to ensure equality of conditions for participation in invitations to tender and contracts; (e) evaluating the effects and results of projects and programmes completed or under way; (f) ensuring that the projects and programmes. financed by the Community are executed in accordance with the arrangements decided upon and with the provisions of the Convention. 5. The Community shall be responsible for preparing and taking financing decisions on projects and programmes. 6. (a) An ACP-EEC Committee shall be set up within the Council of Ministers to study, in general terms and on the basis of specific examples, suitable measures to improve the implementation of financial and technical cooperation, notably by accelerating and streamlining procedures. (b) The Committee shall be composed, on a basis of parity, of representatives of the ACP States and of the Community appointed by the Council of Ministers, or their authorized representatives. It shall meet every quarter and at least once a year at ministerial level. A representative of the Bank shall be present at Committee meetings. (c) The Council of Ministers shall lay down the Committee's rules of procedure in particular the conditions for representation and the number of members of the Committee, the detailed arrangements for their deliberations and the conditions for holding the chair. (d) Within the powers delegated to it by the Council of Ministers the Committee shall carry out the following tasks: (i) it shall collect information on existing procedures relating to the implementation of financial and technical cooperation and give any necessary clarification on these procedures; (ii) it shall examine, at the request of the Community or of the ACP States, any specific difficulties which may arise in the course of implementing such financial and technical cooperation; (iii) it shall inform the Council of Ministers in the annual report referred to in subparagraph (f), of any comments and suggestions on the annual report referred to in Article 119; (iv) it shall submit to the Council of Ministers any suggestions likely to lead to improvement or acceleration in the implementation of financial and technical cooperation; (v) it shall examine any problems in connection with the implementation of the timetables of commitments, execution and payments as provided for in Article 110, with a view to facilitating the removal of any difficulties and bottlenecks discovered at different levels; (vi) it shall carry out such other t Chapter 4. Programming, Appraisal, Implementation and Evaluation ARTICLE 109. 1. The schemes financed by the Community, which are complementary to the ACP States' own efforts, shall be integrated into the economic and social development plans and programmes of the said States and shall tie in with the development objectives and priorities which they set both at national and regional level. 2, At the beginning of the period covered by this Convention, financial and technical cooperation shall be programmed so as to enable: (a) each ACP State to have the clearest and earliest possible indication, before the indicative programme is drawn up, of the amount of the financial assistance administered by the Commission and from which it may benefit during that period and of the terms and conditions which may be attached thereto; (b) the Contracting Parties to ensure that optimum use is made of the different instruments and means of cooperation provided for in this Convention; in order to attain the objectives of financial and technical cooperation; , (c) the Community to know the development objectives and priorities set by each ACP State and the projects and programmes which the ACP States decide to put forward for financing in the framework of their objectives and priorities. 3. An indicative programme shall be adopted by mutual agreement between the Community and each ACP State on the basis of proposals made by that State. The programme shall set out: (a) the guidelines and scope of financial and technical cooperation as they emerge from the exchange of views between the representatives of the ACP State and those of the Community; (b) the ACP State's objectives and priorities for which the Community's financial support is seen as particularly appropriate; (c) specific projects and programmes, where they have been clearly identified, to achieve the development objectives. These projects and programmes together with those subsequently identified in the light of the objectives and priorities. written into the indicative programme, shall then be appraised in accordance with Article 112. 4. In the light of these various aspects, an optimum rate of commitment shall be determined under the conditions set out in Article 110. 5. The indicative programmes shall be sufficiently flexible to take account of any changes occurring in the economic situation of each of the ACP States, and any modifications of their initial priorities and objectives. Each programme may be revised at the request of the ACP State concerned. In any case, it shall be reviewed at least once during the period covered by this Convention. 6. These programmes shall not cover the emergency aid referred to in Article 137 or the measures for stabilizing export earnings referred to in Title IL 7. When the indicative programme of an ACP State is drawn up, its representatives and those of the Community shall hold an exchange of views on the ACP State's priorities and objectives at regional level. Note shall be taken of specific projects and programmes enabling these objectives to be attained in the context of regional cooperation. ARTICLE 110. 1. (a) When the Fund's resources administered by the Commission are programmed the optimum pace for overall commitments, year by year, shall be worked out with the ACP State concerned in the light of the various constraints on the parties and priorities to be observed by them. (b) This optimum pace shall be determined in such a way that the overall amount of sums to be committed each year is distributed as evenly as possible throughout the period of application of this Convention. (c) Any balance remaining from the Fund that has not been committed by the end of the last year of the application of this Convention will be utilized until it has been exhausted, in accordance with the same conditions as those laid down in this Convention. 2. Where the ACP State has presented a complete project dossier within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 111 (1), an advance timetable for appraisal, lasting until the stage when the financing proposal is drawn up, shall be adopted by the Commission and ARTICLE 111. 1. (a) Preparation of the dossiers of projects or programmes proposed under the indicative programmes shall be the responsibility of the ACP States concerned or of other beneficiaries approved by them. (b) The dossiers must contain all the information necessary for the appraisal of the project. (c) Where so requested the Community may provide assistance for drawing up the dossiers. 2. Such dossiers shall be officially transmitted to the Community by the ACP States or the other beneficiaries specified in Article 94 (1). Where the beneficiaries specified in Article 94 (2) are concerned, the express agreement of the State or States concerned shall be required. 3. All projects or programmes transmitted officially in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be brought to the attention of the Community body responsible for taking financing decisions. ARTICLE 112. 1. (a) Project and programme appraisal shall be undertaken in close collaboration between the Community and the ACP States or any other beneficiaries. (b) The various aspects of the projects and programmes shall be appraised, in particular economic, social, technical, financial and administrative aspects. (c) Appraisal should ensure that the projects and programmes really meet the criteria defined in paragraph 2. 2. The criteria used for appraising projects and programmes shall be as follows: (a) projects and programmes must correspond to the objectives and priorities of the ACP State. They must take account of national efforts and of other resources of external origin and dovetail with them and the provisions of this Convention; (b) the effectiveness of projects and programmes shall be assessed by means of an analysis comparing the means to be employed with the effects expected from the technical, social, economic and financial aspects; possible variants shall be examined; (c) projects and programmes shall be assessed for their viability from the viewpoint of the different economic agents involved, be they the State, an undertaking or local communities. This part of the appraisal procedure is to ascertain that the project will produce the expected effects in a period considered normal for the type of scheme concerned. It is also to make sure that any staff and other resources, in particular financial, necessary for operating and maintaining the capital projects and for covering any incidental project costs are actually available locally. This shall be achieved by establishing forward budgets and assessing the opportunities for adapting the project to local constraints and resources; (d) appraisal of the economic return shall be directed at the various effects expected of the project, notably the physical, economic, social and financial effects, if possible on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis; (e) appraisal must take account of the non-quantifiable effects of projects, and particular attention shall be paid to the effects of the project on the environment. 3. The specific difficulties and constraints peculiar to the least-developed ACP States which affect the effectiveness, viability and economic return of projects and programmes shall be taken into account when the said projects and programmes are appraised. ARTICLE 113. 1. The conclusions of the appraisal shall be summarized in a financing proposal, which shall serve as the basis for the Community's decision. 2. The financing proposals, drawn up by the relevant departments of the Community, shall be transmitted to the ACP States concerned. 3. (a) Where the Community body responsible for delivering an opinion on projects fails to deliver a favourable opinion, the relevant departments of the Community shall consult the representatives of the ACP State or States concerned on further action to be taken, in particular on the advisability of submitting the dossier afresh, possibly in a modified form, to the relevant Community body. (b) Before that body gives its final opinion, the representatives of the ACP State or States concerned shall, at their request, be heard by the Community representatives on that body in order to be able to state their grounds for the project. 4. Should the final opinion delivered by that body not be favourable, the competent departments of the Community shall consult afresh with the representatives of the ACP State or States concerned so as to find out whether the project should be submitted as it stands to the Community bodies or whether it should be withdrawn or modified. 5. In the event of the ACP State considering that the project should be submitted as it stands to the decision-making body of the Community, that State may communicate any facts which appear necessary to supplement the information available to that body before the final decision. It may also, before a decision is taken by that body, be heard by the President and the members of the Council of the European Communities in order to submit information additional to that mentioned above. 6. Where the Community's decision-making bodies are unable to pass a project for financing, the ACP State concerned shall be informed of the reasons for such a decision. ARTICLE 114. 1. With a view to accelerating the procedures, financing proposals may deal with multiannual programmes or overall amounts where the financing concerns: (a) sets of training schemes; (b) micro-project programmes; (c) sets of technical cooperation and trade promotion schemes. Financing decisions on individual schemes and projects shall be taken within the framework of such programmes and overall amounts. 2. In the same spirit, decisions on projects and programmes involving a limited amount may be taken by accelerated procedure. 3. Any measures required to streamline and speed up procedures shall be taken in respect of all projects and programmes implemented under this Convention. ARTICLE 115. 1. In respect of the Fund's resources administered by the Commission, for any project or programme on which a financing decision has been taken a financing agreement shall be drawn up between the Commission, acting on behalf of the Community, and the ACP State or States concerned. The agreement shall specify in particular the details of the Fund's financial commitment and the arrangements for and terms of the financing. A timetable for commitments and payments shall be annexed to the financing agreement. 2. In addition, for any project or programme financed by a special loan, a loan contract shall be drawn up between the Commission, acting on behalf of the Community, and the borrower. ARTICLE 116. Any unexpended balance left upon closure of the accounts of projects or programmes financed from the Fund's resources administered by the Commission shall accrue to the ACP State concerned and shall be so specified in the Fund's books. It may be used in the manner laid down in this Convention for the financing of projects and programmes. ARTICLE 117. 1. (a) Cost overruns incurred during the implementation of projects or programmes financed from the Fund's resources administered by the Commission shall be borne by the ACP State or States concerned, subject to the following provisions. (b) However, the financing agreements for all projects shall make provision for appropriations to cover cost increases and contingencies. (c) The ACP States may also set aside a reserve. for this purpose in their indicative programmes. 2. As soon as it appears that cost overruns are likely to be incurred, the national authorizing officer shall so inform the chief authorizing officer through the Commission delegate. The chief authorizing officer shall on this occasion be informed of the measures the national authorizing officer intends to take in order to cover such cost overruns, whether by reducing the scale of the project or programme or by calling on national or other non-Community resources. 3. If it appears impossible to reduce the scale of the project or programme or to cover the cost overruns by drawing on national or other non-Community resources, the Community body responsible for taking the financing decisions may, in each case, take a supplementary commitment decision and finance the relevant expenditure. 4. Without prejudice to the arrangements provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3, the national authorizing officer shall, in coordination with the chief authorizing officer, use the unexpended balances referred to in Article 116 for covering cost overruns on a project or programme, within the limits of a ceiling set at 15 % of the financial commitment for the project or programme concerned. ARTICLE 118. 1. (a) Evaluation may be undertaken during the implementation of projects and programmes. The ACP States concerned and the Community shall draw up a joint progress report, at agreed intervals, on the various aspects of the project and its results. (b) Such a report may serve to re-orient the project during implementation if a joint decision is taken to this effect. 2. (a) The ACP States concerned and. the Community shall organize the joint evaluation of completed projects and programmes. Evaluation shall concern the results, by comparison with the objectives, and also the administration, operation and maintenance of the schemes. The two parties shall study the results of such evaluations. (b) The relevant authorities of the Community and of the ACP States concerned shall each take the appropriate measures called for by the results of the evaluation work. Chapter 5. Policy and Guidelines ARTICLE 119. 1. The Council of Ministers shall examine at least once a year whether the objectives of financial and technical cooperation are being attained and shall also examine the general problems resulting from implementation of that cooperation. This examination shall also cover regional cooperation and measures in favour of the least-developed, land-locked and island ACP States. 2. To this end the Commission shall submit to the Council of Ministers an annual report on the management of Community financial and technical aid. This report, which shall be drawn up in collaboration with the Bank for the parts of the report which concern it, shall be forwarded to the ACP-EEC Committee referred to in Article 108 (6). It shall in particular show the position as to the commitment, implementation and use of the aid, broken down by type of financing and by recipient State, and the results of work done to evaluate projects and programmes. 3. This information shall be accompanied by the results of the work of the ACP-EEC Committee referred to in Article 108 (6) on the general problems of improving the implementation of financial and technical cooperation and by the reports drawn up by groups of experts whom the Council of Ministers may periodically instruct to study the causes of, and means of eliminating, any difficulties or bottlenecks on either side. 4. On the basis of the information referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Council of Ministers shall define the policy and guidelines of financial and technical cooperation and shall adopt resolutions on the measures to be taken by the Community and the ACP States in order to ensure that the objectives of such cooperation are attained. Chapter 6. Execution of Financial and Technical Cooperation ARTICLE 120. The ACP States, and the other beneficiaries authorized by them in accordance with Article 94, shall implement the projects and programmes financed by the Community. Accordingly, they shall be responsible in particular for preparing negotiating and concluding the necessary contracts for the implementation of the operations. ARTICLE 121. 1. The Commission shall appoint the chief authorizing officer of the Fund, who shall ensure that financing decisions are carried out and shall be responsible for managing the Fund's resources. Taking account in particular of the advance timetables for commitments and payments referred to in, Article 110, the chief authorizing officer shall accordingly commit, clear and authorize expenditure, and keep the accounts of commitments and authorizations. 2. In close cooperation with the national authorizing officer, the chief authorizing officer shall ensure equality of conditions for participations in invitations to tender, and see to it that there is no discrimination and that the tender selected is economically the most advantageous. In this connection the chief authorizing officer shall approve the dossiers before invitations to tender are issued, receive the result of the examination of the tenders and approve the proposal for the placing of the contract, subject to the powers exercised by the Commission delegate under Article 123. 3. Subject to the powers exercised by the national authorizing officer under Article 122 (4), the chief authorizing officer shall take any adaptation measures and commitment decisions necessary to ensure the proper execution of approved projects and programmes under the best ecnomic and technical conditions. ARTICLE 122. 1. (a) The government of each ACP State shall appoint a national authorizing officer to represent the authorities of that officer's country in all operations financed from the Fund's resources administered by the Commission.

During the implementation of projects, and subject to the requirement to inform the Commission delegate, the national authorizing officer shall take any adaptation measures necessary to ensure the proper ex ecution of approved projects or programmes under the best economic and technical conditions. Accordingly, the national authorizing officer shall decide on: (a) technical adjustments and alterations on matters of detail, so long as they do not affect the technical solutions adopted and remain within the limits of the provision for minor adjustments; (b) minor alterations to estimates during implementation; (c) transfers from item to item within estimates; (d) changes of site for multiple-unit projects where justified on technical or economic grounds; (e) imposition or remission of penalties for delay; (f) acts discharging guarantors; (g) purchase of goods, irrespective of their origin, on the local market; (h) use of construction equipment and machinery not originating in the Member States or ACP States provided there is no production of comparable equipment and machinery in the Member States or ACP States; (i) subcontracting; (j) final acceptance; however, the delegate must be present at provisional acceptances and endorse the corresponding minutes and, where appropriate, be present at the final acceptance, in particular where the extent of the reservations recorded at the provisional acceptance necessitates major additional work, 5. For contracts of less than 3-5 million EUA and in general for all contracts to which the accelerated procedure applies, decisions taken by the national authorizing officer under the powers vested in that officer shall be deemed approved by the Commission within 30 days of the notification to the Commission delegate. ARTICLE 123. 1. (a) The Commission shall appoint a delegate to each ACP State or group of ACP States to represent it for the purpose of facilitating the application of the Convention. The appointment of the Commission delegate shall be agreed by the ACP State or States concerned. (b) Where a delegate is appointed to a group of ACP States, appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that the delegate is represented by a deputy resident in each of the States concerned in which the delegate is not resident. 2. The Commission shall give its delegate the necessary instructions and delegated powers to facilitate and expedite the preparation, appraisal and implementation of projects financed from the Fund's resources administered by it. The delegate shall work in close cooperation with the national authorizing officer and deal with that officer on behalf of the Commission. In this capacity the delegate shall: (a) approve the invitation to tender dossier wherever invitations to tender are to be issued by accelerated procedure, or in other cases transmit it to the chief authorizing officer for that officer's agreement; (b) be present at the opening of tenders, and receive a copy of them and of the results of their examination; (c) approve within one month the national authorizing officer's proposal for the placing of the contract wherever the three following conditions are fulfilled: the tender selected is the lowest, it is economically the most advantageous and does not exceed the sum earmarked for the contract; (d) approve within one month the proposal for the placing of the contract in all cases where invitations to tender are issued by the accelerated procedure; (e) where the conditions set out in (c) are not fulfilled, forward the proposal for the placing of the contract to the chief authorizing officer for agreement, and the chief authorizing officer shall decide thereon within two months of the receipt by the Commission delegate of the final outcome of examination of the tenders and the proposal for the placing of the contract; (f) participate in the preparation and negotiation of service contracts, 3.

For the purpose of effecting payments in the national currencies of the ACP States, accounts denominated in the currency of one of the Member States shall be opened in each ACP State in the Commission's name with a national public or semipublic financial institution, chosen by mut ARTICLE 125. 1. As regards operations financed by the Community, participation in invitations to tender and contracts shall be open on equal terms to all natural persons and companies or firms falling within the scope of the Treaty and to all natural persons and companies or firms of the ACP States. The companies or firms referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be those defined in Article 161 of the Convention. 2. Measures to encourage the participation of ACP States' undertakings in the execution of contracts shall be taken in order to permit optimum use of these States' natural and human resources. 3. Paragraph 1 shall not imply that the funds provided by the Community must be used exclusively for purchases of goods or payment for services in the Members States and the ACP States. 4. Any participation by third countries in contracts financed by the Community must be of an exceptional nature and be authorized case by case, at the reasoned request of the ACP State concerned, by the competent body of the Community. Unless other appropriate factors prevail account shall be taken of a desire to avoid excessive increases in the cost of projects attributable either to the distances involved and transport difficulties or to the delivery date, notably in the case of the least-developed, land-locked and island ACP States. 5. The Commission and the ACP State concerned shall take the appropriate measures to provide the Community body with the information needed for a decision on such derogations. This body shall examine the information with particular attention in the case of ACP States whose geographical location greatly reduces the competitiveness of suppliers and contractors from the Community and the ACP States. 6. Participation by third countries in contracts financed by the Community may be authorized where the Community participates in the financing of regional or inter-regional cooperation schemes involving third countries and in the joint financing of projects with other providers of funds. ARTICLE 126. 1. The ACP States and the Commission shall take the necessary measures to ensure the widest possible participation on equal terms in invitations to tender and works and supply contracts financed by the Fund's resources managed by the Commission. 2. The purpose of these measures shall be in particular: (a) to ensure advance publication in reasonable time of invitations to tender in the Official Journal. of the European Communities, the official journals of the ACP States and any other suitable information media; (b) to eliminate discriminatory practices or technical specifications which might stand in the way of widespread participation on equal terms; (c) to encourage cooperation between the undertakings of the Member States and of the ACP States, for example by means of preselection and the creation of groups. ARTICLE 127. 1. As a general rule, works and supply contracts financed by the Fund's resources managed by the Commission shall be concluded following an open invitation to tender. 2. However, for operations relating to emergency aid, and for other operations where the urgency of the situation is recognized or where the nature, minor importance or particular characteristics of the works or supplies so warrant, the ACP States may, in agreement with the Commission, exceptionally authorize: - the placing of contracts after restricted invitations to tender, - the conclusion of contracts by direct agreement, - the performance of contracts through public works departments. 3. Furthermore, for operations costing under 3-5 million EUA, recourse to public works departments may be authorized where the recipient ACP State has sufficient suitable equipment and qualified staff available in its national departments. ARTICLE 128. To promote the widest possible participation by national undertakings of the ACP States in the performance of works and supply contracts financed from the Fund's resources managed by the Commission: (a) an accelerated procedure for issuing invitations to tender shall be used for carrying out works estimated to cost less than 3-5 million EUA. Under this procedure, publication shall be confined to the ACP State concerned and the neighbouring ACP States and the time limits for the submission of tenders shall be fixed in accordance with the rules in force in the ACP State concerned. The use of this accelerated procedure shall not exclude the possibility of the Commission's proposing an international invitation to tender to the ACP State concerned where the nature of the works to be undertaken or the advantages of wider participation would appear to justify inviting international competition; (b) for carrying out works whose value is less than 3-5 million EUA, national undertakings of the ACP States shall be accorded a 10 % preference where tenders shall be fixed in accordance with the rules in force in the ACP State concerned. This preference shall be confined to national undertakings of the ACP States within the meaning of the national laws of these States provided that their residence for tax purposes and main business are established in an ACP State and that a significant share of the capital and management staff is supplied by one or more ACP States; (c) for the delivery of supplies, undertakings involved in industrial or craft production of the ACP States shall be accorded a 15 % preference where tenders of equivalent technical and economic quality are compared. This preference shall be confined to national undertakings of the ACP States which provide a sufficient margin of added value. ARTICLE 129. In order to ensure the rapid and effective implementation of projects and programmes financed by the Community in the least-developed ACP States, the Community shall give special priority to the application of specific measures in the following areas: (a) the award of contracts following accelerated invitations to tender on the terms specified in Article 128; (b) the placing of contracts following restricted invitations to tender and the conclusion of contracts by direct agreement on the terms specified in Article 127; (c) the performance of contracts through public works departments on the terms specified in Article 127; (d) the placing of service contracts by the Commission, in agreement with the ACP State concerned where the scheme is urgent, of minor importance or short duration, particularly in the case of appraisals concerned with the preparation of projects and programmes; (e) the arrangement of payment procedures in such a way that the States concerned do not have to bear any pre-financing costs. ARTICLE 130. 1. For each operation the criteria for selecting the tender that is economically the most advantageous shall take into account inter alia the qualifications of and the guarantees offered by the tenderers, the nature and conditions of implementation of the works or supplies and the price, operating costs and technical value of those works or supplies. 2. Where two tenders are acknowledged to be equivalent on the basis of the criteria stated above, preference shall be given to the tender of the undertaking which is a national of an ACP State or if no such tender is forthcoming to the one which permits the greastest possible use of the physical and human resources of the ACP States, 3. The ACP States and the Commission shall ensure that all the selection criteria are specified in the invitation to tender dossier. ARTICLE 131. The general conditions applicable to the award and performance of works and supply contracts financed from the Fund's resources administered by the Commission are contained in the general conditions which, on a proposal from the Commission, shall be adopted by decision of the Council of Ministers at its first meeting following the entry into force of this Convention. ARTICLE 132. 1. Any dispute arising between the authorities of an ACP State and a contractor, supplier or provider of services on the occasion of the placing or performance of a contract financed by the Fund shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with rules of procedure adopted by the Council of Ministers. 2. The rules of procedure referred to above shall be adopted, on a proposal, by a decision of the Council of Ministers not later than its first meeting following the entry into force of this Convention. Chapter 8. Regional Cooperation ARTICLE 133. 1.

This assistance shall aim to: (a) accelerate economic cooperation and development both within and between the regions of the ACP States; (b) accelerate diversification of the economies of the ACP States; (c) reduce the economic dependence of the ACP States on imports by maximizing output of those products for which the ACP States in question have real potential; (d) create sufficiently wide markets within the ACP States and neighbouring States by removing the obstacles which hinder the development and integration of those markets; (e) promote and expand trade between the ACP States and with neighbouring third countries; (f) maximize the use of resources and services in the ACP States; (g) strengthen organizations set up by the ACP States to promote regional cooperation and integration; (h) implement specific measures in favour -of the land-locked and island countries, notably in respect of transport and communications. 2. To this end, an amount of 600 million EUA from the financial resources provided for in Article 95 for the economic and social development of the ACP States shall be reserved for financing their regional and inter-regional projects and for participation in any co-financing arrangements that may be made to implement such projects. ARTICLE 134. 1.

For the purpose of promoting their regional cooperation the least-developed ACP States shall have a priority claim to the application of the relevant provisions in respect of projects concerning at least one least-developed ACP State, notably where infrastructure projects relating to transport, communications, telecommunications, energy and the development of production are concerned. ARTICLE 136. 1. An ACP State or group of ACP States participating with neighbouring non-ACP countries in a regional or inter-regional project may request the Community to finance that part of the project for which it is responsible. 2. Existing regional cooperation bodies or any- such bodies which may be set up may make a request for Community financing on behalf of their ACP Member States with the latter's explicit agreement. 3.
