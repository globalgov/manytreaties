# This is a template for importing, cleaning, and exporting data

# Stage one: Collecting data
LABPTA <- read.csv("data-raw/agreements/LABPTA/LABPTA.csv")

# Stage two: Correcting data
# In this stage you will want to correct the variable names and
# formats of the 'LABPTA' object until the object created
# below (in stage three) passes all the tests.
LABPTA <- tibble::as_tibble(LABPTA) %>%
  # standardise date formats across agreements datacube
  dplyr::mutate(year = ifelse(year == "NA", "NA", paste0(year, "-01-01"))) %>%
  manydata::transmutate(labptaID = as.character(`Number`),
                        Title = manypkgs::standardise_titles(Name),
                        Signature = messydates::as_messydate(as.character(year)),
                        Force = messydates::as_messydate(as.character(year))) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Begin = dplyr::coalesce(Signature, Force)) %>%
  dplyr::select(labptaID, Title, Begin, Signature, Force) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(Begin)

# Add treatyID column
LABPTA$treatyID <- manypkgs::code_agreements(LABPTA, LABPTA$Title, LABPTA$Begin)

# Add manyID column
# manyID <- manypkgs::condense_agreements(manytrade::agreements)
# LABPTA <- dplyr::left_join(LABPTA, manyID, by = "treatyID")

# Re-order the columns
LABPTA <- LABPTA %>%
  dplyr::select(treatyID, Title, Begin, Signature, Force, labptaID) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(Begin)

# Check for duplicates in manyID
# duplicates <- LABPTA %>%
#   dplyr::mutate(duplicates = duplicated(LABPTA[, 1])) %>%
#   dplyr::relocate(manyID, duplicates)

# delete rows that only have diff title but same Beg and other variables
LABPTA <- subset(LABPTA, subset = !duplicated(LABPTA[, c(1, 3, 6)]))

# manypkgs includes several functions that should help cleaning
# and standardising your data.
# Please see the vignettes or website for more details.

# Stage three: Connecting data
# Next run the following line to make LABPTA available within the many universe.
manypkgs::export_data(LABPTA, datacube = "agreements",
                      URL = "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11558-018-9301-z")
# This function also does two additional things.
# First, it creates a set of tests for this object to ensure adherence
# to certain standards.You can hit Cmd-Shift-T (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-T (Windows)
# to run these tests locally at any point.
# Any test failures should be pretty self-explanatory and may require
# you to return to stage two and further clean, standardise, or wrangle
# your data into the expected format.
# Second, it also creates a documentation file for you to fill in.
# Please note that the export_data() function requires a .bib file to be
# present in the data_raw folder of the package for citation purposes.
# Therefore, please make sure that you have permission to use the dataset
# that you're including in the package.
