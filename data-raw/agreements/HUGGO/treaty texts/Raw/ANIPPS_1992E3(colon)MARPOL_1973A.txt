carried by sea in packaged formregulation 1application1 unless expressly provided otherwise, the regulations of this annex apply to all ships carrying harmful substances in packaged form.1.1 for the purposes of this annex, "harmful substances" are those substances which are identified as marine pollutants in the international maritime dangerous goods (imdg) code.[1]1.2 guidelines for the identification of harmful substances in packaged form are given in the appendix to this annex.1.3 for the purposes of this annex, "packaged form" is defined as the forms of containment specified for harmful substances in the imdg code.2 the carriage of harmful substances is prohibited, except in accordance with the provisions of this annex.3 to supplement the provisions of this annex, the government of each party to the convention shall issue, or cause to be issued, detailed requirements on packing, marking, labelling. documentation, stowage, quantity limitations and exceptions for preventing or minimizing pollution of the marine environment by harmful substances.[1]4 for the purposes of this annex, empty packagings which have been used previously for the carriage of harmful substances shall themselves be treated as harmful substances unless adequate precautions have been taken to ensure that they contain no residue that is harmful to the marine environment.5 the requirements of this annex do not apply to ships' stores and equipment.regulation 2packingpackages shall be adequate to minimize the hazard to the marine environment, having regard to their specific contents.regulation 3marking and labelling1 packages containing a harmful substance shall be durably marked with the correct technical name (trade names alone shall not be used) and, further, shall be durably marked or labelled to indicate that the substance is a marine pollutant. such identification shall be supplemented where possible by any other means, for example, by use of the relevant united nations number.2 the method of marking the correct technical name and of affixing labels on packages containing a harmful substance shall be such that this information will still be identifiable on packages surviving at least three months' immersion in the sea. in considering suitable marking and labelling, account shall be taken of the durability of the materials used and of the surface of the package.3 packages containing small quantities of harmful substances may be exempted from the marking requirements.[2]regulation 4[3]documentation1 in all documents relating to the carriage of harmful substances by sea where such substances are named, the correct technical name of each such substance shall be used (trade names alone shall not be used) and the substance further identified by the addition of the words "marine pollutant'.2 the shipping documents supplied by the shipper shall include, or be accompanied by, a signed certificate or declaration that the shipment offered for carriage is properly packaged and marked, labelled or placarded as appropriate and in proper condition for carriage to minimize the hazard to the marine environment.3 each ship carrying harmful substances shall have a special list or manifest setting forth the harmful substances on board and the location thereof. a detailed stowage plan which sets out the location of the harmful substances on board may be used in place of such special list or manifest.copies of such documents shall also be retained on shore by the owner of the ship or his representative until the harmful substances are unloaded. a copy of one of these documents shall be made available before departure to the person or organization designated by the port state authority.4 when the ship carries a special list or manifest or a detailed stowage plan, required for the carriage of dangerous goods by the international convention for the safety of life at sea, 1974, as amended, the documents required by this regulation may be combined with those for dangerous goods. where documents are combined, a clear distinction shall be made between dangerous goods and harmful substances covered by this annex.regulation 5stowageharmful substances shall be properly stowed and secured so as to minimize the hazards to the marine environment without impairing the safety of the ship and persons on board.regulation 6quantity limitationscertain harmful substances may, for sound scientific and technical reasons, need to be prohibited for carriage or be limited as to the quantity which may be carried aboard any one ship. in limiting the quantity, due consideration shall be given to size, construction and equipment of the ship, as well as the packaging and the inherent nature of the substances.regulation 7exceptions1 jettisoning of harmful substances carried in packaged form shall be prohibited, except where necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or saving life at sea.2 subject to the provisions of the present convention, appropriate measures based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of harmful substances shall be taken to regulate the washing of leakages overboard, provided that compliance with such measures would not impair the safety of the ship and persons on board._____________________ APPENDIX guidelines for the identification of harmful substances in packaged formfor the purposes of this annex, substances identified by any one of the following criteria are harmful substances:- bioaccumulated to a significant extent and known to produce a hazard to aquatic life or to human health (hazard rating "+" in column a[4] ); or- bioaccumulated with attendant risk to aquatic organisms or to human health with a short retention of the order of one week or less (hazard rating "z" in column a4 ); or- liable to produce tainting of seafood (hazard rating "t" in column a4 ); or- highly toxic to aquatic life, defined by a lc50 /96[5] hour less than 1 ppm (hazard rating "4" in column b4 ).[*] adopted pursuant to resolution mepc.58(33) of 30 october 1992.[1] reference is made to the international maritime dangerous goods (imdg) code adopted by the organization by resolution a.716(17) as it has been or may be amended by the maritime safety committee.
