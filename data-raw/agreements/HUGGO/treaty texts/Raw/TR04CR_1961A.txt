herter secretary of stateelmer f. bennett under secretary of the interiorfor canada:john g diefenbaker prime minister of canadae. d. fulton minister of justicea. d. p. heeney ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of canada to the united states of america ANNEX a principles of operationgeneral1. the canadian storage provided under article ii will be operated in accordance with the procedures described herein.2. a hydrometeorological system, including snow courses, precipitation stations and stream flow gauges will be established and operated, as mutually agreed by the entities and in consultation with the permanent engineering board, for use in establishing data for detailed programming of flood control and power operations. hydrometeorological information will be made available to the entities in both countries for immediate and continuing use in flood control and power operations.3. sufficient discharge capacity at each dam to afford the desired regulation for power and flood control will be provided through outlet works and turbine installations as mutually agreed by the entities. the discharge capacity provided for flood control operations will be large enough to pass inflow plus sufficient storage releases during the evacuation period to provide the storage space required. the discharge capacity will be evaluated on the basis of full use of any conduits provided for that purpose plus one half the hydraulic capacity of the turbine installation at the time of commencement of the operation of storage under the treaty.4. the outflows will be in accordance with storage reservation diagrams and associated criteria established for flood control purposes and with reservoir-balance relationships established for power operations. unless other-wise agreed by the entities the average weekly outflows shall not be less than 3,000 cubic feet per second at the dam described in article ii (2) (a), not. less than 5,000 cubic feet per second at the dam described in article ii (2)(b) and not less than 1,000 cubic feet per second at the dam described iii article ii(2)(c). these minimum average weekly releases may be scheduled by the canadian entity as required for power or other purposes.flood control5. for flood control operation, the united states entity will submit flood control operating plans which may consist of or include flood control storage reservation diagrams and associated criteria for each of the dams. the canadian entity will operate in accordance with these diagrams or any variation which the entities agree will not derogate from the desired aim of the flood control plan. the use of these diagrams will be based on data obtained in accordance with paragraph 2. the diagrams will consist of relationships specifying the flood control storage reservations required at indicated times of the year for volumes of forecast runoff. after consultation with the canadian entity the united states entity may from time to time as conditions warrant adjust these storage reservation diagrams within the general limitations of flood control operation. evacuation of the storages listed hereunder will be guided by the flood control storage reservation diagrams and refill will be as requested by the united states entity after consultation with the canadian entity. the general limitations of flood control operation are as follows:(a) the dam described in article ii (2) (a) - the reservoir will be evacuated to provide up to 80,000 acre-feet of storage, if required, for flood control use by may 1 of each year.(b) the dam described in article ii (2) (b) - the reservoir will be evacuated to provide up to 7,100,000 acre-feet of storage, if required, for flood control use by may 1 of each year.(c) the dam described in article ii (2) (e) - the reservoir will be evacuated to provide up to 700,000 acre-feet of storage, if required, for flood control use by april 1 of inch year and up to 1,270,000 acre-feet of storage, if required, for flood control use by may 1 of each year.(d) the canadian entity may exchange flood control storage provided in the reservoir referred to in subparagraph (b) for additional storage provided in the reservoir referred to in subparagraph (a) if the entities agree that the exchange would provide the same effectiveness for control of floods on the columbia river at the dalles, oregon.power6. for power generating purposes the 15,500,000 acre feet of canadian storage will be operated in accordance with operating plans designed to achieve optimum power generation downstream in the united states of america until such time as power generating facilities are installed at the site referred to in paragraph 5(a) or at sites in canada downstream therefrom.7. after at-site power is developed at the site referred to in paragraph 5 (a,) or power generating facilities are placed in operation in canada downstream from that site, the storage operation will be changed so as to be operated in accordance with operating plans designed to achieve optimum power generation at-site in canada and downstream in the united states of america and canada, including consideration of any agreed electrical coordination between the two countries. any reduction in the downstream power benefits in the united states of america resulting from that change in operation of the canadian storage shall not exceed in any one year the reduction in downstream power benefits in the united states of america which would result from reducing by 500,000 acre-feet the canadian storage operated to achieve optimum power generation in the united states of america and shall not exceed at any time during the period of the treaty the reduction in downstream power benefits in the united states of america which would result from similarly reducing the canadian storage by 3,000,000 acre-feet.8. after at-site power is developed at the site referred to in paragraph 5(a) or power generating facilities are placed in operation in canada downstream from that site, storage may be operated to achieve optimum generation of power in the united states of america alone if mutually agreed by the entities in which event the united states of america shall supply power to canada to offset any reduction in canadian generation which would be created as a result of such operation as compared to operation to achieve optimum power generation at-site in canada and downstream in the united states of america and canada. similarly, the storage may be operated to achieve optimum generation of power in canada alone if mutually agreed by the entities in which event canada shall supply power to the united states of america to offset any reduction in united states generation which would be created as a result of such operation as compared to operation to achieve optimum power generation at-site in canada and downstream in the united states of america and canada.9. before the first storage becomes operative, the entities will agree on operating plans and the resulting downstream power benefits for each year until the total of 15,500,000 acre-feet of storage in canada becomes operative. in addition, commencing five years before the total of 15,500,000 acre-feet of storage is expected to become operative, the entities will agree annually on operating plans and the resulting downstream power benefits for the sixth succeeding year of operation thereafter. this procedure will continue during the life of the treaty, providing to both the entities, in advance, an assured plan of operation of the canadian storage and a determination of the resulting downstream power benefits for the next succeeding five years ANNEX b determination of downstream power benefits1, the downstream power benefits in the united states of america attributable to operation in accordance with annex a of the storage provided by canada under article ii will be determined in advance and will be the estimated increase in dependable hydroelectric capacity in kilowatts for agreed critical stream flow periods and the increase in average annual usable hydroelectric energy output in kilowatt hours on the basis of an agreed period of stream flow record.2. the dependable hydroelectric capacity to be credited to canadian storage will be the difference between the average rates of generation in kilowatts during the appropriate critical stream flow periods for the united states of america base system, consisting of the projects listed in the table, with and without the addition of the canadian storage, divided by the estimated average critical period load factor. the capacity credit shall not exceed the difference between the capability of the base system without canadian storage and the maximum feasible capability of the base system with canadian storage, to supply firm load during the critical stream flow periods.3. the increase in the average annual usable hydroelectric energy will be determined by first computing the difference between the available hydroelectric energy at the united states ham system with and without canadian storage. the entities will then agree upon the part of available energy which is usable with and without canadian storage, and the difference thus agreed will be the increase in average annual usable hydroelectric energy. determination of the part of the energy which is usable will include consideration of existing and scheduled transmission facilities and the exist-once of markets capable of using the energy on a contractual basis similar to the then existing contracts. the part of the available energy which is considered usable shall be the sum of:(a) the firm energy,(b) the energy which can be used for thermal power displacement in the pacific northwest area as defined in paragraph 7, and(c) the amount of the remaining portion of the available energy which is agreed by the entities to be usable and which shall not exceed in any event 40% of that remainder.4. an initial determination of the estimated downstream power benefits in the united states of america from canadian storage added to the united states base system will be made, before any of the canadian storage becomes operative. this determination will include estimates of the downstream power benefits for each year until the total of 15,500,000 acre-feet of canadian storage becomes operative.5. commencing five years before the total of 15,500,000 acre-feet of storage is expected to become operative, estimates of downstream power benefits will be calculated annually for the sixth succeeding year on the basis of the assured plan of operation for that year.6. the critical stream flow period and the details of the assured plan of operation will be agreed upon by the entities at each determination. unless otherwise agreed upon by the entities, the determination of the downstream power benefits shall be based upon flows for the twenty year period beginning with july 1928 as contained in the report entitled modified flows at selected power sites-columbia river basin, dated june 1957. no reduction in the downstream power benefits will be made at any time during the period of the treaty. no reduction in the downstream power benefits credited to canadian storage will be made as a result of the load estimate in the united states of america, for the year for which the damnation is made, being less than the load estimate for the preceding year.7. in computing the increase in dependable hydroelectric capacity and the increase in average annual hydroelectric, energy, the procedure shall be in accordance with the three steps described below and shall encompass the loads of the pacific northwest area. the pacific northwest area for purposes of these determinations shall be oregon, washington, idaho and montana west of the continental divide but shall exclude areas served on the ratification date by the california oregon power company and utah power and light company.step ithe system for the period covered by the estimate will consist of the canadian storage, the united states base system, any thermal installation operated in coordination with the base system, and additional hydroelectric projects which will provide storage releases usable by the base system which will provide storage releases that are usable by the base system. the installations included in this system will be those required, with allowance for adequate reserves, to meet the forecast power load to be served by this system in the united states of america, including the estimate flow of power at points of inter-connection with adjacent areas, subject to paragraph 3, plus the portion of the entitlement of canada that is expected to be used in canada. the capability of this system to supply this load will be determined on the basis that the system will be operated in accordance with the established operating practices of each of the projects involved.step ii a determination of the energy capability will be made using the same thermal installation as in step i, the united states base system with the same installed capacity as in step i and canadian storage.step iiia similar determination of the energy capability will be made using the same thermal installation as in step i and the united states base system with the same installed capacity as in step i.8. the downstream power benefits to be credited to canadian storage will be the differences between the determinations in step ii and step iii in dependable hydroelectric capacity and in average annual usable hydroelectric energy, made in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.whereas the senate of the united states of america by their resolution of march 16,1961, two-thirds of the senators present concurring the did advise and consent to the ratification of the aforesaid treaty;whereas the aforesaid treaty was duly ratified by the

for external affairs canadajanuary 22, 1964sir,i have the honour to refer to discussions which have been held between representatives of the government of canada and of the government of the united states of america regarding the treaty between canada and the united states of america relating to cooperative development of the water resources of the columbia river basin signed at washington on january l7, 1961. on the basis of these discussions, the government of canada understands that the two governments have agreed to the terms of the attached protocol.i should like to propose that, if agreeable to your government, this note together with the protocol attached thereto and your reply, shall constitute an agreement between our two governments relating to the carrying out of the provisions of the treaty with effect from the date of the exchange of instruments of notification of the treaty.accept, sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.paul martin secretary of state for external affairsthe honourable dean rusk, secretary of state of the united states of america, washington ANNEX to exchange of notes dated january 22, 1964 between the governments of canada and the united states regarding the columbia river treaty PROTOCOL 1. if the united states entity should call upon canada to operate storage in the columbia river basin to meet flood control needs of the united states of america pursuant to article iv (2) (b) or article iv (3) of the treaty, such call shall be made only to the extent necessary to meet forecast flood control needs in the territory of the united states of america that cannot adequately be met by flood control facilities in the united states of america in accordance with the following conditions:(1) unless otherwise agreed by the permanent engineering board, the need to use canadian flood control facilities under article iv(2) (b) of the treaty shall be considered to have arisen only in the case of potential floods which could result in a peak discharge in excess of 600,000 cubic feet per second at the dalles, oregon, assuming the use of all related storage in the united states of america existing and under construction in january 1961, storage provided by any dam constructed pursuant to article xii of the treaty and the canadian storage described in article iv (2) (a) of the treaty.(2) the united states entity will call upon canada to operate storage under article iv(3) of the treaty only to control potential floods in the united states of america that could not be adequately controlled by all the related storage facilities in the united states of america existing at the expiration of 60 years from the ratification date but in no event shall canada be required to provide any greater degree of flood control under article iv(3) of the treaty than that provided for under article iv(2) of the treaty.(4) a call shall be made only if the canadian entity has been consulted whether the need for flood control is, or is likely to be, such that it cannot be met by the use of flood control facilities in the united states of america in accordance with subparagraphs (1) or (2) of this paragraph. within ten days of receipt of a call, the canadian entity will communicate its acceptance, or its rejection or proposals for modification of the call, together with supporting considerations. when the communication indicates rejection or modification of the call the united states entity will review the situation in the light of the communication and subsequent developments and will then withdraw or modify the call if practicable. in the absence of agreement on the call or its terms the united states entity will submit the matter to the permanent engineering board provided for under article xv of the treaty for assistance as contemplated in article xv (2) (e) of the treaty. the entities will be guided by any instructions issued by the permanent engineering board. if the permanent engineering board does not issue instructions within ten days of receipt of a submission the united states entity may renew the call for any part or all of the storage covered in the original call and the canadian entity shall forthwith honour the request.2. in preparing the flood control operating plans in accordance with paragraph 5 of annex a of the treaty, and in making calls to operate for flood control pursuant to article iv (2) (b) and article iv (3) of the treaty, every effort will be made to minimize flood damage both in canada and the united states of america.3. the exchange of notes provided for in article viii (1) of the treaty shall take place contemporaneously with the exchange of the instruments of ratification of the treaty provided for in article xx of the treaty.4.(1) during the period and to the extent that the sale of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits within the united states of america as a result of an exchange of notes pursuant to article viii (1) of the treaty relieves the united states of america of its obligation to provide east-west standby transmission service as called for by article x(l) of the treaty, canada is not required to make payment for the east-west standby transmission service with regard to canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits sold in the united states of america.(2) the united states of america is not entitled to any payments of the character set out in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph in respect of that portion of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits delivered by the united states of america to canada at any point on the canada-united states of america boundary other than at, a point near oliver, british columbia, and the united states of america is not required to provide the east-west standby transmission service referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph iii respect of the portion of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits which is so delivered.5. inasmuch as control of historic streamflows of the kootenay river by the dam provided for in article xii (1) of the treaty would result in more than 200,000 kilowatt years per annum of energy benefit downstream in canada, as well as important flood control protection to canada, and the operation of that dam is therefore of concern to canada, the entities shall, pursuant to article xiv(2) (a) of the treaty, cooperate on a continuing basis to coordinate the operation of that dam with the operation of hydroelectric plants on the kootenay river and elsewhere in canada in accordance with the provisions of article xii (5) and article xii (6) of the treaty.6.(1) canada and the united states of america are in agreement that article xiii (1) of the treaty provides to each of them a right to divert water for a consumptive use.(2) any diversion of water from the kootenay river when once instituted under the provisions of article xiii of the treaty is not subject to any limitation as to time.7. as contemplated by article iv (1) of the treaty, canada shall operate the canadian storage in accordance with annex a and hydroelectric operating plans made thereunder. also, as contemplated by annexes a and b of the treaty and article xiv (2) (k) of the treaty, these operating plans before they are agreed to by the entities will be conditioned as follows:(1) as the downstream power benefits credited to canadian storage decrease with time, the storage required to be operated by canada pursuant to paragraphs 6 and 9 of annex a of the treaty, will be that required to produce those benefits.(2) the hydroelectric operating plans, which will be based on step i of the studies referred to in paragraph 7 of annex b of the treaty, will provide a reservoir-balance relationship for each month for the whole of the canadian storage committed rather than a separate relationship for each of the three canadian storages. subject to compliant with any detailed operating plan agreed to by the entities as permitted by article xiv (2) (k) of the treaty, the manner of operation which will achieve the specific storage or release of storage called for in a hydroelectric operating plan consistent with optimum storage use will be at the discretion of the canadian entity.(3) optimum power generation at-site in canada and downstream in canada and the united states of america referred to in paragraph 7 of annex a of the treaty will include power generation at-site and downstream in canada of the canadian storages referred to in article ii (2) of the treaty, power generation in canada which is coordinated therewith, downstream power benefits from the canadian storage which are produced in the united states of america and measured under the terms of annex b of the treaty, power generation in the pacific northwest area of the united states of america and power generation coordinated therewith.8. the determination of downstream power benefits pursuant to amex b of the treaty, in respect of each year until the expiration of thirty years from the commencement of full operation in accordance with article iv of the treaty of that portion of the canadian storage described in article ii of the treaty which is last placed in full operation, and thereafter until otherwise agreed upon by the entities, shall be based upon stream flows for the thirty-year period beginning july 1928 as contained in the report entitled "extension of modified flows through 1958-columbia, river basin" and dated june 1960, as amended and supplemented to june 29, 1961, by the water management subcommittee of the columbia basin inter-agency committee.9.(1) each load used in making the determinations required by steps ii and iii of paragraph 7 of annex b of the treaty shall have the same shape as the load of the pacific northwest area as that area is defined in that paragraph.(2) the capacity credit of canadian storage shall not exceed the difference between the firm load carrying capabilities of the projects and installations included in step ii of paragraph 7 of annex b of the treaty and the projects and installations included in step iii of paragraph 7 of annex b of the treaty.10. in making all determinations required by annex b of the treaty the loads used shall include the power required for pumping water for consumptive use into the banks equalizing reservoir of the columbia basin federal reclamation project but mention of this particular load is not intended in any way to exclude from those loads any use of power that would normally be part of such loads.11. in the event operation of any of the canadian storages is commenced at a time which would result in the united states of america receiving flood protection for periods longer than those on which the amounts of flood control payments to canada set forth in article vi(l) of the treaty are based, the united states of america and canada shall consult as to the adjustments, if any, in the flood control payments that may he equitable in the light of all relevant factors. any adjustment would be calculated over the longer period or periods on the same basis and in the same manner as the calculation of the amounts set forth in article vi (1) of the treaty. the consultations shall begin promptly upon the determination of definite dates for the commencement of operation of the canadian storages.12. canada and the united states of america are in agreement that the treaty does not establish any general principle or precedent applicable to waters other than those of the columbia river basin and does not detract from the application of the boundary waters treaty, 1909, to other waters.the secretary of state to the canadian secretary of state for external affairsdepartment of state washingtonjanuary 22, 1964sir:i have the honor to refer to your note dated january 22, 1964, together with the annex thereto regarding the treaty between canada and the united states of america relating to cooperative development of the water resources of the columbia river basin signed at washington on january 17,1961.i wish to advise you that the government of the united states of america agrees that your note with the annex thereto, together with this reply, shall constitute an agreement between our two governments relating to the carrying out of the provisions of the treaty with effect from the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification of the treaty.accept, sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.dean ruskthe honourable paul martin, p.c., q.c., secretary of state for external affairs, ottawa.department of state washingtonjanuary 22,1964sir:i have the honor to refer to the discussions which have been held between representatives of the government of canada and of the government of the united states of america regarding a sale of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits under the treaty between canada and the united states of america relating to cooperative development of the water resources of the columbia river basin, signed on january 17,1961.on the basis of these discussions my government understands that the two governments recognize that it would be in the public interest of both countries if canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits could be disposed of, as contemplated by article viii of the treaty, in accordance with general conditions and limits similar to those set out in detail in the attachment hereto, and further, that before such a disposition can be concluded and confirmed by the two governments, additional steps must be taken in each country. therefore, in furtherance of this aim, it is understood the two governments are agreed that:a) the government of the united states will use its best efforts to arrange for disposition of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits within the united states of america in accordance with the general conditions and limits set forth in the attachment, andb) the government of canada will use its best efforts to accomplish all those things which are considered necessary and preliminary to ratification of the treaty as quickly as possible, including any arrangements for implementation and acceptance of the general conditions and limits set forth in the attachment.i should like to propose that if agreeable to your government this note together with the attachment and your reply shall constitute an agreement by our governments relating to the treaty.accept, sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.dean ruskthe honorable paul martin, p.c., q.c., secretary of state for external affairs, ottawa.attachment relating to terms of salea. the disposition shall consist of the downstream power benefits to which canada is entitled under the treaty, other than canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits resulting from the construction or operation of a project described iii article ix of the treaty, and shall be by way of a contract of sale authorized in accordance with article viii of the treaty between the british columbia hydro and power authority and a single purchaser containing provisions mutually satisfactory to the parties to the contract but shall be subject to and be operative in accordance with the following general conditions and limits:1.(a) the storages described in article ii of the treaty shall be fully operative for power purposes in accordance with the following schedule:storage described in article ii (2) (c) -approximately 1,400,000 acre feet on april 1, 1968,storage described in article ii (2) (b) -approximately 7,100,000 acre feet on april 1, 1969,storage described in article ii (2) (a)-approximately 7,000,000 acre feet on april 1, 1973.(b) the period of sale of the entitlement allocated to each of the storages shall terminate and expire thirty years from the date on which that storage is required to be fully operative for power purposes in accordance with the schedule in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.(c) in the event any storage is not fully operative in accordance with the schedule in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph or if, during the period of sale, the storage is not operated as required by the hydroelectric operating plans agreed upon in accordance with the treaty, as modified by any detailed operating plan agreed upon in accordance with article xiv (2) (k) of the treaty, and the canadian entitlement is thereby reduced, the british columbia hydro and power authority shall pay the purchaser an amount equal to the cost it would have to incur to replace that part of the reduction in the canadian entitlement which the vendees of the purchaser would have used other than costs that could have been avoided had every reasonable effort to mitigate losses been made by the purchaser, the united states entity and the owners of non-federal dams on the columbia river in the united states of america. alternatively, the british columbia hydro and power authority may, at its option, supply power to the purchaser in an amount which assures that the purchaser receives the capacity and energy which would have constituted that part of the reduction in the canadian entitlement that the vendees of the purchaser could leave used if them had been no default, together with appropriate adjustments to reflect transmission costs in the united states of america, delivery to be made when the loss of power would otherwise have occurred.if the assurance described in paragraph b.5. of this attachment is given to the purchaser, the united states entity may succeed to all the rights of the purchaser and its vendees to receive the entire canadian entitlement, or that part that could be used by the vendees, and to be compensated by british columbia hydro and power authority in the event of non-receipt thereof. the united states entity agrees that before it purchases more costly power from any third party for the purpose of supplying the necessary amount of the canadian entitlement to the purchaser, it will first cause to be delivered to the purchaser, or for its account, any available surplus capacity or energy from the united states federal columbia river system and compensation to the united states entity bemuse of such deliveries shall be computed by applying the then applicable rate schedules of the bonneville power administration to the deliveries.in the event of disagreement, determination of compensation in money or power due under this paragraph shall be resolved by arbitration and shall be confined to the actual loss incurred in accordance with the principles in this paragraph.(d) for the purpose of allocating downstream power benefits among the treaty storages from april 1, 1998 to april 1, 2003, the percentage of downstream power benefits allocated to each treaty storage shall be the percentage of the total of the treaty storages provided by that storage.2. for the period of the sale the british columbia hydro and power authority shall operate and maintain the treaty storages in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.3.(a) the purchase price of the entitlement shall be $254,400,000, in united states funds as of october 1, 1964, subject to adjustment, in the event of an earlier payment of all or part thereof, to the then present worth, at a discount rate of 41/2 percent per annum.(b) the purchase price shall be paid to canada contemporaneously with the exchange of ratifications of the treaty and shall be applied towards the cost of constructing the treaty projects through a transfer of the purchase price by canada to the government of british columbia, pursuant to arrangements deemed satisfactory to canada, to be entered into between canada, and the government of british columbia.4. if, during the period of the sale, there is any reduction in canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits which results from action taken by the canadian entity pursuant to paragraph 7 of annex a of the treaty, the british columbia hydro and power authority shall, by supplying power to the purchaser, or otherwise as may be agreed, offset that reduction in a manner so that the purchaser will be compensated therefor.5. the purchaser shall have and may exercise the rights of the british columbia hydro and power authority relating to tile negotiation and conclusion with the united states entity, of proposals relating to the exchanges authorized by article viii (2) of the treaty with respect to any portion of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits sold to the purchaser.b. the notes to be exchanged pursuant to article viii (1) of the treaty shall contain, inter alia, provisions incorporating the following requirements:1. as soon as practicable after start of construction of each treaty project the canadian and united states entities shall agree upon a program for filling the storage provided by the project. the filling program shall have the objective of having the storages described in article ii (2) (e) and article ii (2) (b) of the treaty full by september 1 following the date when the storages become fully operative and the storage provided by the dam mentioned in article ii (2) (a) of the treaty full to 15 million acre-feet by september 1, 1975. this objective shall be reflected in the hydroelectric operating plans and shall take into account generating requirements at-site and downstream in canada and the united states of america to meet loads.2. in the event the united states of america becomes entitled to compensation in respect of a breach of the obligation under article iv (6) of the treaty to commence full operation of a storage, compensation payable to the united states of america under article xviii (5) (a) of the treaty shall be made in an amount equal to 2.70 mills per kilowatt-hour, and 46 cents per kilowatt of dependable capacity for each month or fraction thereof, in united states funds, for and in lieu of the power which would have been forfeited under article xviii (5) (a) of the treaty if canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits had not been sold in the united states of america. alternatively, canada may, at its option, supply capacity and energy to the united states entity in an amount equal to that which would have been forfeited, together with appropriate adjustments to reflect transmission costs in the united states of america delivery to be made when the loss would otherwise have occurred.3. a diminution of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits sold in the united states of america which is directly attributable to a failure to comply with paragraph a.1 (a) or paragraph a.2 of this attachment, in the absence of compensation therefor by the british columbia hydro and power authority, constitutes a breach of the treaty by canada and article xviii (5) of the treaty and the exculpatory provisions in article xviii of the treaty do not apply to such breach. compensation or replacement of power as specified in paragraph a.1 (c) of this attachment shall be made by canada and shall be accepted by the united states of america as complete satisfaction of canada's liability under this paragraph.4. for any year in which canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits is sold in the united states of america, the united states entity may decide the amount of the downstream power benefits for purposes connected with the disposition thereof in the united states of america. this authorization, however, shall not affect the rights or relieve the obligations of the canadian and united states entities relating to joint activities under the provisions of article xiv and annexes a and b of the treaty; nor shall it apply to determination of compensation provided for in paragraph a.1 (e) and paragraph b.2 of this attachment.5. if necessary to accomplish the sale of canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits in accordance with this attachment, the united states entity shall assure unconditionally the delivery to or for the account of the purchaser, by appropriate exchange contracts, of an amount of power agreed between the united states entity and the purchaser to be the equivalent of the entitlement during the period of the sale.c. canada shall designate the british columbia hydro and power authority as the canadian entity for the purposes of article xiv (1) of the treaty.the canadian secretary of state for external affairs to the secretary of statethe secretary

america relating to cooperative development of the water resources of the columbia river basin signed at washington on 17 january 1961, to the protocol attached to my note to the honourable dean rusk, secretary of state of the united states of america, dated 22 january 1964, and to exchange of instruments of ratification of the treaty which occurred today.i also have the honour to refer to the discussions which have been held between representatives of the government of canada and of the government of the united states of america in connection with the exchange of notes, dated 22 january 1964, regarding sale in the united states of america of canada's entitlement under the treaty to downstream power benefits.my government also understands that your government has designated the administrator of the bonneville power administration, department of the interior, and the division engineer, north pacific division, corps of engineers, department of the army, as the united states entity for the purposes of article xiv (1) of the treaty, and i would inform you that the government of canada has designated the british columbia hydro and power authority, a corporation incorporated in the province of british columbia by the british columbia hydro and power authority act, 1961 as the canadian entity for the purposes of that article. a copy of the designation is attached hereto.3on the basis of those discussions the government of canada proposes that the canadian entitlement purchase agreement 3 regarding the sale in the united states of america of the canadian entitlement under the treaty to downstream power benefits entered into between the british columbia hydro and power authority and the columbia storage power exchange the single purchaser referred to in the attachment to your note of january 21, 1964, relating to the terms of the sale, a copy of which agreement is attached hereto, be authorized for the purposes of article viii (1) of the treaty as a disposal of the canadian entitlement in the united states of america for the period and in accordance with the other terms and provisions set out in the canadian entitlement purchase agreement.my government also understands that your government pursuant to paragraph e.54 in the attachment to mr. secretary rusk's note of january 22, 1964, relating to the terms of the sale, has determined that the united states entity shall enter into and that it has entered into the canadian entitlement exchange agreements which agreements assure unconditionally the delivery for the account of the columbia storage power exchange of an amount of power agreed between the united states entity and the columbia storage power exchange to be the equivalent of the canadian entitlement being sold under the canadian entitlement purchase agreement, and that the united states entity has succeeded to all the rights and obligations of the columbia storage power exchange under the canadian entitlement purchase agreement other than the obligation to pay the purchase price, and further that the united states entity has, pursuant to article xi of the treaty, approved the use of the improved stream flow in the united states of america brought about by the treaty by entering into canadian entitlement allocation agreements with owners of non-federal dams on the columbia river.my government also understands that the two governments are agreed that the government of the united states of america undertakes that:(1) so long as the canadian entitlement exchange agreements remains in force, the united states entity will perform all the obligations of the columbia storage power exchange under the canadian entitlement purchase agreement other than the obligation to pay the purchase price specified in section 3 of the canadian entitlement purchase agreement;(2) in the event the canadian entitlement is reduced as a result of a failure on the part of the canadian entity to comply with section 4 of the canadian entitlement purchase agreement and if the failure results other than from wilful omission by the canadian entity to fulfill the obligations under that agreement, the united states entity will, withhold compensation, off-set the effect of that failure by adjusting the operation of the portion of the system described in step i of paragraph 7 of annex b of the treaty which is in the united states of america to the extent that the united states entity can do so without loss of energy or capacity to that portion of the system; and(3) if the procedure described in paragraph (2) above does not fully offset the effect of the failure, then to the extent the entities agree thereon an additional offsetting adjustment in the operation of the portion of the system described in step i of annex b of the treaty which is in the united states of america and which would result in only an energy loss will be made if the canadian entity delivers to the united states entity energy sufficient to make up one half that energy loss.(4) in order to make up any reduction in the canadian entitlement, which reduction is to be determined in accordance with section 6 of the canadian entitlement purchase agreement, the united states entity will cause to be delivered the least expensive capacity and energy available and, to the extent that it would be the least expensive available, will deliver, at the then applicable rate schedules of the bonneville power administration, any available surplus capacity and energy from the united states federal columbia river system.the government of canada also proposes that:(5) contemporaneously with the exchange of the instruments of ratification cspe shall have paid to canada the sum in united states funds of $ 253,929,534.25, being the equivalent of the sum of $ 254,400,000 in united states funds as of october 1, 1964 adjusted to september 16, 1964 at a discount rate of 4 1/2 percent per annum on the basis set out in the january 22, 1964 exchange of notes between our two governments relating to the terms of sale, which sum shall be applied towards the cost of constructing the treaty projects through a transfer of the sum by canada to the government of british columbia pursuant to arrangements entered into between canada and british columbia.(6) no modification or renewal of the canadian entitlement purchase agreement shall be effective until approved by the governments of canada and the united states of america, evidenced by an exchange of notes.(7) the storages described in article ii of the treaty shall be considered fully operative when the facilities for such storages are available and outlet facilities are operable for regulating flows in accordance with the flood control and hydroelectric plans.(8) as soon as practicable, the canadian and united states entities shall agree upon a program for filling the storage provided by each of the treaty projects. the filling program shall have the objective of having the storages described in article ii (2) (a), article ii (2) (b), and article ii (2) (c) of the treaty filled to the extent that usable storage, in the amounts provided for each storage in article ii of the treaty is available by september 1 following the date when the storage becomes fully operative, and of having the storage provided by the dam described in article ii (2) (a) filled to 15 million acre-feet by september 1, 1975. this objective shall be reflected in the hydroelectric operating plans and shall take into account generating requirements at-site and downstream in canada and the united states of america to meet loads and requirements for flood control.(9) in the event the united states of america becomes entitled to compensation from canada for loss of downstream power benefits, other than canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits, in respect of a breach of the obligation under article iv (6) of the treaty to commence full operation of a storage, compensation payable to the united states of america under article xviii (5) (a) of the treaty shall be made in an amount equal to 2.70 mills per kilowatt-hour of energy, and 46 cents per kilowatt of dependable capacity for each month or fraction thereof, in united states funds, for and in lieu of the power which would have been forfeited under article xviii (5) (a) of the treaty if canadaaes entitlement to downstream power benefits had not been sold in the united states of america. the power which would have been forfeited shall be canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits attributable to the particular storage had it commenced full operation in accordance with article iv (6) of the treaty and shall consist of (1) dependable capacity for the period of forfeiture and (2) that portion of average annual usable energy which would have been available during the period of forfeiture assuming the energy to be available at a uniform rate throughout the year. alternatively, canada may, at its option, offset the power for which compensation is to be made by delivering capacity and energy to the united states entity, such delivery to be made, unless otherwise agreed by the entities, during the of breach and at a uniform rate. the option for canada to provide in place of paying money shall permit canada to make compensation partly by supplying power and partly by paying money, as may be mutually agreed by the entities.(10) the canadian entity shall at reasonable intervals provide current reports to the united states entity of the progress of construction of the treaty storages. in the event there is a likelihood of delay in meeting the completion dates set out in section 4 of the canadian entitlement purchase agreement or a delay which will give rise to a claim under paragraph (9) hereof the canadian entity will advise of the probability of power being available to make the compensation required.(11) to the extent the canadian entity does not make compensation for a reduction in the canadian entitlement arising as a result of a failure to comply with section 4 of the canadian entitlement purchase agreement, canada shall make such compensation and such compensation shall be accepted in complete satisfaction of all claims arising out of the failure in respect of the reduction in the canadian entitlement for which such compensation was made.(12) for any year in which canada's entitlement to downstream power benefits is sold to columbia storage power exchange, the united states entity may decide the amount of the downstream power benefits for purposes connected with the disposition thereof in the united states of america. this authorization, however, shall neither affect the rights or relieve the obligations of the canadian and united states entities relating to joint activities under the provisions of article xiv and annexes a and b of the treaty, nor shall it apply to determination of compensation provided for in the canadian entitlement purchase agreement or pursuant to paragraph (9) hereof or to determination of the power benefits to which canada is entitled.(13) any power delivered by the canadian entity or by canada in accordance with the canadian entitlement purchase agreement or this note shall be delivered at points of interconnection on the canadian-united states border mutually acceptable to the entities. appropriate adjustments shall be made to reflect transmission costs and transmission losses in the united states of america.(14) any dispute arising under the canadian entitlement purchase agreement, including, but without limitation, a dispute whether any event requiring compensation has occurred, the amount of compensation due or the amount of any over-delivery of power is agreed to be a difference under the treaty to be settled in accordance with the provisions of article xvi of the treaty, and the parties to the canadian entitlement purchase agreement may avail themselves of the jurisdiction hereto conferred.the government of canada therefore proposes that if agreeable to your government this note together with your reply thereto constitutes an agreement by our governments relating to the treaty with effect from the day of the exchange of instruments of ratification of the treaty.accept, excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest

treaty.section 3 payment by cspecontemporaneously with the exchange of the instruments of ratification, cspe is causing to be paid to canada the sum, in united states funds, of $ 254,400,000.00 as of october 1, 1964, subject to adjustment in the event of an earlier payment thereof to the then present worth at a discount rate of 4 percent per annum, which sum shall be applied towards the cost of constructing the treaty projects through a transfer of the sum by canada to the government of british columbia pursuant to arrangements entered into between canada and british columbia. the authority acknowledges that the receipt by canada of the said sum is consideration for all the covenants of the authority in this agreement and particularly the covenants to construct and operate the treaty projects and is a complete discharge of cspe for the full purchase price for the sale effected in section 2 of this agreement.section 4 covenants(1) the authority covenants and agrees with cspe that it will undertake all requisite construction work in a good workmanlike manner and that the storages described in article ii of the treaty shall be fully operative for power purposes under this agreement by the following dates:(a) the duncan lake storage, april 1, 1968.(b) the arrow lakes storage, april 1, 1969.(c) the mica creek storage, april 1, 1973.to be fully operative the facilities

plans as contemplated by the treaty.(2) the authority covenants and agrees with cspe that it will operate and maintain the treaty storages in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with the provisions of the treaty and any arrangements made pursuant to the treaty and that it will not take any action prohibited by the treaty.section 5 flood controlnothing in this agreement affects or alters the obligations, rights, and privileges of the entities under the treaty relating to operation and compensation for flood control and without restricting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly agreed that any reduction in generation in the united states brought about by operation for flood control under the treaty or any flood control arrangements made pursuant to the treaty shall not be a reduction in the canadian entitlement for which compensation is required under this agreement.section 6 compensationin the event the canadian entitlement is reduced as a result of a failure to comply with section 4 of this agreement:(1) if the failure results other than from wilful omission by the authority to fulfill its obligations under this agreement, the united states entity has agreed that it will, without compensation, offset the effect of that failure by adjusting the operation of the portion of the system described in step i of paragraph 7 of annex b of the treaty which is in the united states to the extent that the united states entity can do so without loss of energy or capacity to that portion of the system. if the foregoing procedure does not fully offset the effect of the failure, then to the extent the entities agree hereon, an additional offsetting adjustment in the operation of the portion of the system described in step i of annex b of the treaty which is in the united states and which would result in only an energy loss will be made in the authority delivers to the united states entity energy sufficient to make up one half of that energy loss.(2) if the effect of the failure is not entirely offset by the procedure specified in subsection (1) of this section, the reduction in the canadian entitlement shall be deemed to be one half of the difference in dependable hydroelectric capacity and average annual usable energy, capable of being produced by:(a) the step ii system as specified in annex b of the treaty for the year in which the reduction occurs, using the 30 year stream flow record provided for in section 8 of the protocol, with allowance in each of the 30 stream flow years for the effect of the adjustment made in following the procedure specified in subsection (1) of this section and(b) the same system for that year with the application of allowance in each of the 30 stream flow years for the effects of the occurrence causing the reduction and the dependable hydroelectric capacity and average annual usable energy for the purpose of paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be calculated on the basis of an operation for optimum generation in the united states in the light of the offsetting adjustments and in the light of the effects of the occurrence causing the reduction.(3) if the failure is the result of an occurrence to which the procedure specified in subsection (1) of this section is not applicable, the reduction shall be deemed to be one half of the difference in dependable hydroelectric capacity and average annual usable energy, capable of being produced by:(a) the step ii system as specified in annex b of the treaty for the year in which the reduction occurs, using the 30 year stream flow record provided for in section 8 of the protocol, with no allowance for the effects of the occurrence causing the reduction and(b) the same system for that year with the application of allowance in each of the 30 stream flow years for the effects of the occurrence causing the reduction and the dependable hydroelectric capacity and average usable energy for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be calculated on the basis of an operation for optimum generation in the united states in the light of the effects of the occurrence causing the reduction.(4) the authority shall make compensation for reductions in the canadian entitlement, which reductions are to be determined in accordance with subsections (2) or (3) of this section, in amounts equal to the cost of replacing the reduction in the canadian entitlement.(5) the authority may at its option, and in lieu of the monetary compensation payable under subsection (4) of this section, make compensation by supplying capacity and energy in an amount equal to the reduction in the canadian entitlement determined in accordance with subsections (2) or (3) of this section and adjusted to reflect transmission costs in the united states, delivery to be made when the loss would otherwise have occurred. the authority may provide combinations of money capacity and energy that are mutually acceptable in discharge of its obligation make compensation under this section.(6) the authority shall give notice as soon as possible after it becomes apparent to it that compensation may be due and will at that time indicate the amounts of capacity and energy which it anticipates it will be able to make available.(7) the united states entity has agreed that, in order to make up any reduction in the canadian entitlement, it will cause to be delivered the least expensive capacity and energy available and, to the extent that it would be the least expensive, will deliver at the then applicable rate schedules of the bonneville power administration any available surplus capacity and energy from the united states federal columbia river system. the cost of replacement referred to in subsection (4) of this section shall be determined as if the reduction was in fact made up as contemplated by the agreement referred to in the preceding sentence.(8) compensation made in accordance with this section shall be accepted as satisfaction of all claims against the authority with respect to the reduction in the canadian entitlement for which such compensation was made and with respect to the act or omission of the authority from which the right to such compensation arose.(9) any obligation to mitigate damages by the united states entity, cspe, rhe [sic] vendees of cspe, and the owners of the non-federal dams on the columbia river in the united states is satisfied by compliance with this section.(10) if the canadian entitlement exchange agreements referred to in section 10 are not in force, compensation for a reduction in the canadian entitlement in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) of this section, is required only in respect of that part of the reduction in the canadian entitlement which cspe and its vendees could have used and only in respect of costs that could not have been avoided had every reasonable effort to mitigate been made by cspe and the owners of non-federal dams on the columbia river in the united states.section 7 reduction of the canadian entitlement in accordance with the treatyany reduction in the canadian entitlement resulting from action taken pursuant to paragraph 7 of annex a of the treaty shall be determined in accordance with subsection (3) of section 6 of this agreement and unless otherwise agreed, the authority shall offset the reduction by supplying capacity and energy equal to the reduction, the energy to be supplied in equal monthly amounts.section 8 settlement of disputesany dispute arising under this agreement, including but without limitation to a dispute as to whether any event requiring compensation has occurred, the amount of compensation due or the amount of any over-delivery of power, is agreed to be a difference under the treaty to be settled in accordance with the provisions of article xvi of the treaty. any determination of compensation in money or power due shall be confined to the actual loss incurred in accordance with the principles contained in section 6 of this agreement.section 9 exchanges of capacity and energy(1) the authority agrees that cspe shall have and may exercise the rights of the authority as the canadian entity relating to the negotiation and conclusion with the united states entity of proposals relating to the exchanges authorized by article viii (2) of the treaty with respect to any portion of the canadian entitlement.(2) it is agreed that no exchange of capacity for energy or of energy for capacity or modification in the delivery of energy in equal amounts each month as provided in the treaty shall be taken into account in the determination of compensation to be made by the authority pursuant to this agreement.section 10 exchange agreementsthe bonneville power administrator acting as the administrator and for and on behalf of the united states entity has by entering into canadian entitlement exchange agreements, assured unconditionally the delivery to the vendees of cspe by appropriate exchange contracts of an amount of power agreed between the united states entity and cspe to be the equivalent of the canadian entitlement and the united states entity, while those agreements are in force, will succeed to all the rights of cspe and its vendees to receive the entire canadian entitlement and all other rights of cspe arising from this agreement. cspe therefore instructs the authority, until otherwise notified, to make any compensation whether pursuant to section 6 or section 7 of this agreement to the united states entity. cspe agrees that any settlement of a claim for compensation or arrangement entered into pursuant to this agreement by the united states entity shall be binding on cspe.section 11 payments1.the authority shall pay any amount in united states funds determined to be due in accordance with the terms hereof within thirty days of receipt of an invoice for such amount.2.should the authority deliver power in excess of the amount required as compensation, then appropriate adjustments shall be made in kind or in money.section 12 approvalsno modification of renewal of this agreement shall be effective until approved by the governments of canada and the united states of america, evidenced by an exchange of notes.section 13 deliveriesany power delivered by the authority pursuant to this agreement shall be delivered at mutually acceptable points of interconnection on the canadian-united states border. appropriate adjustments shall be made to reflect transmission costs and transmission losses in the united states.section 14 noticesany notices shall be in writing and shall be delivered or mailed prepaid as follows:columbia storage power exchange, 20 n. main street, east wenatchee, washington,
