fishing vessels of Japan (hereinafter referred to as "the
  vessels") within the Australian fishing zone (hereinafter
referred to as "the Zone") and for the issuance of
licences by the Government of Australia,
HAVE AGREED as follows:
ARTICLE I
The Government of Australia shall, in accordance
with the provisions of the Head Agreement, issue licences
for the vessels, the number of which shall not exceed 250,
subject to payment to the Government of Australia of a fee
of six million, nine hundred and eighty thousand

ARTICLE II
The Government of Australia shall, by the
licences issued for the vessels referred to in Article I
of this Subsidiary Agreement, permit those vessels to take
within the Zone all- species of tuna and bill-fish,
together with all other species of finfish including
oceanic sharks which are incidentally caught:
(a) by the use of floating long-lines, except in the areas
specified in the Appendix to this Subsidiary
Agreement, which forms an integral part hereof; and
(b) by the use of hand-lines, in the area of the Coral Sea

area of the Zone at the time when that vessel is not
permitted to take fish in that area in accordance with the
provisions of Article II of this Subsidiary Agreement.
Cases verified by the Government of Australia as cases in
which the drifting of a part of a long-line into such an
area cannot reasonably be avoided shall not be regarded as
infringements of this Subsidiary Agreement.

relevant laws and regulations of Australia, undertakes to
permit the vessels licensed under this Subsidiary
