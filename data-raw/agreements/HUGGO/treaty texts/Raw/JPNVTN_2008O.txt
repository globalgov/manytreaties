determination that there is clear evidence that
increased imports of an originating good have caused
or are threatening to cause serious injury to a
domestic industry.

Committee on the application of the provisional
bilateral safeguard measure shall be initiated

and
(c) “VNM” is the value of non-originating materials used
in the production of a good.
3. FOB referred to in subparagraph 2(a) shall be the value:
(a) adjusted to the first ascertainable price paid for
a good from the buyer to the producer of the good,
if there is free-on-board value of the good, but it
is unknown and cannot be ascertained; or
(b) determined in accordance with Articles 1 through 8
of the Agreement on Customs Valuation, if there is
no free-on-board value of a good. 
26
4. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the value of
non-originating materials used in the production of a good in
a Party:
(a) shall be determined in accordance with the Agreement
on Customs Valuation and shall include freight,
insurance, and where appropriate, packing and all
other costs incurred in transporting the materials
to the importation port in the Party where the
producer of the good is located; or
(b) if such value is unknown and cannot be ascertained,
shall be the first ascertainable price paid for the
materials in the Party, but may exclude all the costs
incurred in the Party in transporting the materials
from the warehouse of the supplier of the materials
to the place where the producer is located such as
freight, insurance and packing as well as any other
known and ascertainable costs incurred in the Party.
5. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the VNM of a good shall
not include the value of non-originating materials used in the
production of originating materials of the Party which are used
in the production of the good.
6. For the purposes of subparagraph 3(b) or 4(a), in applying
the Agreement on Customs Valuation to determine the value of
a good or non-originating materials, the Agreement on Customs
Valuation shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to domestic
transactions or to the cases where there is no domestic
transaction of the good or non-originating material.
Article 28
De Minimis
1. A good that does not satisfy the requirements of
subparagraph 1(b) of Article 26 or an applicable CTC-based rule
of origin set out in Annex 2 shall be considered as an originating
good of a Party if:
 (a) in the case of a good classified under Chapters 16,
19, 20, 22, 23, 28 through 49, and 64 through 97 of
the Harmonized System, the total value of
non-originating materials used in the production of
the good that have not undergone the required CTC does
not exceed 10 percent of the FOB;

required CTC does not exceed 10 percent or seven
percent of the FOB, as specified in Annex 2; or 
27
(c) in the case of a good classified under Chapters 50
through 63 of the Harmonized System, the weight of
all non-originating materials used in the production
of the good that have not undergone the required CTC
does not exceed 10 percent of the total weight of the
good,
provided that it meets all other applicable criteria set out
in this Chapter for qualifying as an originating good.
Note: For the purposes of this paragraph, subparagraph 2(a) of

the non-originating materials used in the production of the good
have met the applicable CTC-based rule of origin for the good.
3. If a good is subject to an LVC-based rule of origin, the
value of the packing materials and containers in which the good
is packaged for retail sale shall be taken into account as
originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be,
in calculating the LVC of the good.
Article 33
Accessories, Spare Parts, Tools,
 and Instructional or Other Information Materials
1. If a good is subject to the requirements of CTC or specific

determining whether the good qualifies as an originating good,
provided that:
 (a) the accessories, spare parts, tools, and
instructional or other information materials are not
invoiced separately from the good; and 
29
 (b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare
parts, tools, and instructional or other information
materials are customary for the good.
2. If a good is subject to an LVC-based rule of origin, the

inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the
foreign character of the relevant services or service
suppliers.

Schedule of Specific Commitments under both the GATS and this
Agreement, if modification or withdrawal has been made to such
commitment with regard to its Schedule of Specific Commitments
under the GATS and compensatory adjustment has been made to the
other Party as an “affected Member” in accordance with Article
XXI of the GATS, the Parties shall agree to amend this Agreement
to incorporate such modification or withdrawal into it without
further negotiation, subject to their applicable domestic
procedures.
Article 65
Qualifications, Technical Standards, and Licensing
 With a view to ensuring that measures by a Party relating
to qualification requirements and procedures, technical
standards, and licensing requirements of service suppliers of
the other Party do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade
in services, each Party shall endeavor to ensure that such
measures:
 (a) are based on objective and transparent criteria, such
as competence and the ability to supply the service;

quality of the service; and

or certifications granted in the other Party; 
47
 (b) the Party shall accord the other Party an adequate
opportunity to negotiate the accession of that other
Party to such an agreement or arrangement or to
negotiate comparable ones with it between the Parties;
and
 (c) where the Party accords such recognition
 unilaterally, the Party shall accord the other Party
an adequate opportunity to demonstrate that the
education or experience obtained, requirements met,
or licenses or certifications granted in the other
Party should also be recognized.
Article 67
Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a
service in its Area does not, in the supply of the monopoly
service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent
with the Party’s commitments under this Chapter.
2. Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either
directly or through an affiliated juridical person, in the
supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights

monopoly position to act in the Area of the Party in a manner
inconsistent with such commitments.

financial difficulties or threat thereof, a Party may adopt or
maintain restrictions on trade in services on which it has
undertaken specific commitments, including on payments or
transfers for transactions related to such commitments. It is
recognized that particular pressure on the balance of payments
of a Party in the process of economic development or economic
transition may necessitate the use of restrictions to ensure,
inter alia, the maintenance of a level of financial reserves
adequate for the implementation of its program of economic
development or economic transition.

 (a) shall ensure that the other Party is treated as
favorably as any non-Party;

may give priority to the supply of services which are more
essential to its economic or development programs. However,
such restrictions shall not be adopted or maintained for the
purpose of protecting a particular service sector.
4. Any restrictions adopted or maintained under paragraph 1,
or any changes therein, shall be promptly notified to the other

circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were
accorded to the juridical person.
