ARTICLES.?
Modification of Schedules
1. A Party may modify or withdraw any commitment in its Schedule
(referred to in this Article as the "modifying Party"), at any time after three (3)
years have elapsed from the date on which that commitment entered into force, in
accordance with the provisions of this Article. If one or more of the GeC Member

ARTICLES.S
Domestic Regulation
I. In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall
ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are
administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.
2. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial,
44
arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of
an affected service supplier of another Party, for the prompt review of, and where
justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in
services. Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with
the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in
fact provide for an objective and impartial review.
3. The provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall not be construed to
require a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be
inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system.
4. Where authorization is required for the supply of a service on which a
specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of a Party shall,
within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application
considered complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of
the decision concerning the application. At the request of the applicant, the
competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue delay, information
concerning the status of the application.
5. With the objective of ensuring that domestic regulation, including
measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical
standards and licensing requirements, does not constitute an unnecessary barrier to
trade in services, the Parties shall jointly review the results of the negotiations on
disciplines on these measures, pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article VI of the GATS,
with a view to their incorporation into this Chapter. The Parties note that such
disciplines aim to ensure that such requirements are, inter alia:
(a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence
and the ability to supply the service;
(b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the
service;
(c) in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction
on the supply of the service.
6. Pending the incorporation of disciplines pursuant to paragraph 5 of this
Article, for sectors where a Party has undertaken specific commitments and
subject to any terms, limitations, conditions or qualifications set out therein, a
Party shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and technical
standards that nullify or impair such specific commitments in a manner which:
(a) does not comply with the criteria outlined in subparagraphs (a),
(b) or (c) of paragraph 5 of this Article; and
(b) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time
the specific commitments in those sectors were made.
45

paragraph 6 of this Article, account shall be taken of international standards of
relevant international organisations8
applied by that Party.
ARTICLE 5.9
Recognition

negotiations on recognition of professional qualifications, licenses, or registration
procedures with a view to the achievement of early outcomes.
3. Any arrangement reached pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article shall be
consistent with this Agreement.
ARTICLE 5.10
Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
I. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its
territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act
in a manner inconsistent with that Party's Schedule of specific commitments.
2. Where a Party's monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an
affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly
rights and which is subject to that Party's Schedule of specific commitments, the
Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act
in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.
3. If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of
another Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraphs I or 2 of this
Article, it may request the Party establishing, maintaining or authorizing such
supplier to provide specific information concerning the relevant operations.
4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service
suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect:
(a) authorizes or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and
(b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its

other than those falling under Article 5.10, may restrain competition and thereby
restrict trade in services.
2. A Party shall, at the request of another Party, enter into consultations with
a view to eliminating practices referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The Party
addressed shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and
shall cooperate through the supply of publicly available non-confidential
information of relevance to the matter in question. The Party addressed shall also
provide other information available to the requesting Party, subject to its domestic
laws and to the conclusion of satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding
of its confidentiality by the requesting Party.
ARTICLE 5.12
Payments and Transfers
1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 5.13, a Party shall

difficulties or threat thereof, a Party may adopt or maintain restrictions on trade in
services in respect of which it has obligations under Articles 5.3 and 5.4, including
on payments or transfers for transactions relating to such obligations. It is
recognised that particular pressures on the balance-of-payments of a Party in the
process of economic development may necessitate the use of restrictions to ensure,
inter alia, the maintenance of a level of financial reserves adequate for the
implementation of its programme of economic development.
47
2. The restrictions referred to in paragraph I of this Article:
(a) shall not discriminate among WTO Members;

priority to the supply of services which are more essential to their economic or
development programmes. However, such restrictions shall not be adopted or
maintained for the purpose of protecting a particular service sector.
4. Any restrictions adopted or maintained under paragraph I of this Article,
or any changes therein, shall be promptly notified to the affected Parties.
5. The Party adopting any restrictions under paragraph I of this Article shall
commence consultations with all affected Parties in order to review the restrictions
adopted by it.

specific information on any of its measures of general application or international
agreements within the meaning of paragraph I of this Article. Each Party shall also
use the existing enquiry points or, when they do not exist, establish one or more
enquiry points to provide specific information to another Party, upon request, on
all such matters.
48
ARTICLE 5.15
Disclosure of Confidential Information
Nothing in this Chapter shall require any Party to provide confidential information,
the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary
to the public interest, or which would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of
particular enterprises, public or private.
ARTICLE 5.16
Denial of Benefits
I. Subject to prior notification and consultation, a Party may deny the
benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of another Party if the service supplier

(ii) by a person which operates and/or uses the vessel in
whole or in part but which is of a non-Party;
(c) to a service supplier of another Party where the Party establishes
that the service supplier is owned or controlled by persons of a
non-Party and that it has no substantive business operations in the

)
If after this Agreement enters into force, a Party enters into any agreement on trade
in services with a non-Party, it shall give sympathetic consideration to a request by

benefits under paragraph 4 of this Article, the procedures and deadlines established

intended to replace the agreed objective of full compliance. Benefits will only be
suspended until the measure found to be in breach of the Agreement has been
withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with the Agreement, or
when the disputing parties have reached an agreement on the resolution of the
dispute. The responding Party shall notify the complaining party and the Joint
Committee of the measures it has taken to comply.
8. Where the disputing Parties disagree on the conformity with this
Agreement of any implementing measure adopted after the suspension of benefits,
the responding party may request the original arbitration panel to rule on this issue.

with this Agreement, the arbitration panel will determine whether the complaining
Party may resume the suspension of benefits at the same or a different level.
ARTICLE 9.10
Temporary Remedies for Non-compliance
I. If, prior to the deadline for implementation determined under paragraph 2
76
of Article 9.9, the responding Party considers that it will require further time to
comply with the arbitration panel ruling, it will inform the complaining Party of
the extra period of time it requires, whilst presenting an offer of market-opening
compensation for this additional period of time until it comes into compliance with
the ruling.
