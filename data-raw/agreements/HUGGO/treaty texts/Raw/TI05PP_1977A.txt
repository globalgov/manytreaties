matters regulated in this treaty and the regulations are concerned, no contracting state may require compliance with requirements different from or additional to those which are provided in this treaty and the regulations ARTICLE 4 new deposit(1) (a) where the international depositary authority cannot furnish samples of the deposited microorganism for any reason, in particular,(i) where such
