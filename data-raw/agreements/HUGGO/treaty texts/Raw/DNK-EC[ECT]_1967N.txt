Delegation of the commission to the GATT Trade Negotiations
Geneva, 30 June 1967
Sir,
On the occasion of the multilateral trade negotiations held under
GATT-2 at Geneva, the European Economic Community granted its negotiat
ing partners the concessions specified in annex I on tuna under tariff
heading ex 03.01 B I b) of the common customs tariff, " subject to
to observance of. the reference price ".
I am ableio give the following particulars on the manner in which this
reference price will be applied : ;..__.......
1. The level of the reference price shall be fixed at 350 units of account per
metric ton. This price relates to " albacore-yellowfin " whole tuna weighing more
than three kilogrammes.
In the case oi species and varieties of tuna other than " albacore-yellowfin "
tihn ea nrenfeexre nIIcIe. price" "s hal'l be m"u" ltiplied b--y-- .o..n--e o-.f. .t.h-e- corre.,c..t-i_v,e coefficients specified
In the case of "dressed" and "gilled and gutted" tuna, corrective coeffi
cients fixed at 1.24 and 1.14 respectively shall be applied.
-, -
2. The reference price shall enter into force simultaneously with the
application of the concessions and shall remain at the level specified in paragraph 1
for a period expiring on 1 July 1970.
Upon the expiry of this period, the level of the reference price may be modified
whenever a modification is deemed necessary in the light of changes in the factors
determining tuna prices on the markets of the Community and after the Government
of Denmark has been consulted.
3. The machinery for the reference price shall operate as follows :
- Imports at prices below the reference price shall be subject to .a countervailing
change offsetting the difference between the level of the reference price and the
price at which the goods are imported into each of the member States oi EEC
before customs duties have been levied.
- The reference price must be observed and the countervailing changes, if any,
must be applied in respect of all goods imported from third countries,
including imports within the limits of tariff quotas.
However, the charge shall not be applied with respect to Denmark if Denmark
is in a position to guarantee and to undertake a commitment that it will observe
the reference price under .conditions to be determined and observes it in its actual
offers.
It is agreed that, in return for the concessions specified in the annexes, the
Government of Denmark shall waive the exercise of the negotiating rights which
it possesses by virtue of the concessions specified in annex II, granted during the
Geneva tariff negotiations in 1960-1961 by the Community on the same tariff
headings. - ----- -- - -
However, during the consultations referred to in paragraph 2 the Government
of Denmark may exercise its negotiating rights arising out of the earlier concessions
specified in annex II.
These negotiating rights shall be calculated on the,basis qf the volume of trade
expressed in terms of value by taking into account the arithmetical average of the
quantities imported by EEC from Denmark under the concessions in question
during the three-year period 1964-1965-1966.
I should be grateful if you would inform me whether you can indicate
your agreement with the foregoing.
Accept, Sir, etc.
