Such duties may only be introduced during the first two years following the entry into force of this Agreement, and after consultation in the Joint Committee.

Article 21

Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the provisions of Article 5 and Article 18 (1), first indent, may be taken by Estonia in the form of increased customs duties.

These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where these difficulties produce important social problems.

Customs duties on imports applicable in Estonia to products originating in the Community introduced by these measures may not exceed 25 % ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for products originating in the Community.

The total value of imports of the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15 % of total imports of industrial products from the Community as defined in Chapter I during the last year for which statistics are available.

These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding two years unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall cease to apply at the latest three years after entry into force of this Agreement.

No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent effect concerning that product.

Estonia shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures it intends to take and, at the request of the Community, consultations shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to which they apply before they are applied.

- serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of one of the Parties, or

- serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region,

the Community or Estonia, whichever is concerned, may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 26.

Article 24

Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 8 and 18 leads to:

(i) re-export towards a third country against which the exporting Party maintains, for the product concerned, quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures having equivalent effect; or

(ii) a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting Party;

and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 26. The measures shall be non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.

Article 25

The Member States of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as 'the Member States') and Estonia shall progressively adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that, by the end of the fifth year following the entry into force of this Agreement, no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of the Member States and of Estonia.

2. In the cases specified in Articles 22, 23 and 24, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3(d) applies, as soon as possible, the Community or Estonia, as the case may be, shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the two Parties.

In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.

The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.

3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:

(a) as regards Article 23, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties.

If the Joint Committee or the exporting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem. These measures must not exceed the scope of what is necessary to remedy the difficulties which have arisen;

(b) as regards Article 22, the Joint Committee shall be informed of the dumping case as soon as the authorities of the importing Party have initiated an investigation. If no end has been put to the dumping or if no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures;

(c) as regards Article 24, the difficulties arising from the situations referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee.

The Joint Committee may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties. If it has not taken such a decision within 30 days of the matter being referred to it, the exporting Party may apply appropriate measures on the exportation of the product concerned;

(d) where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or Estonia whichever is concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 22, 23 and 24, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation.

Article 27

TITLE III PAYMENTS, COMPETITION AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROVISIONS

Article 30

The Parties undertake to authorize, in freely convertible currency, any payments on the current account of balance of payments to the extent that the transaction underlying the payments concerns movements of goods between the Parties which have been liberalized pursuant to this Agreement.

Article 31

With reference to the provisions of this chapter, and notwithstanding the provisions of Article 32, until a full convertibility of the Estonian currency in the meaning of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is introduced, Estonia may in exceptional circumstances apply exchange restrictions connected with the granting or taking up of short and medium-term credits to the extent that such restrictions are imposed on Estonia for the granting of such credits and are permitted according to Estonia's status under the IMF.

Estonia shall apply these restrictions in a non-discriminatory manner. They shall be applied in such a manner as to cause the least possible disruption to this Agreement. Estonia shall inform the Joint Committee promptly of the introduction of such measures and of any changes therein.

Article 32

1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Estonia:

(i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;

(ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community or of Estonia as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;

(iii) any public aid, which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.

2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Community or, for products covered by the ECSC Treaty, on the basis of corresponding rules of the ECSC Treaty including secondary legislation.

3. The Joint Committee shall, within three years of the entry into force of this Agreement, adopt by decision the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.

Until these rules are adopted, the provisions of this Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade shall be applied as the rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 point (iii) and related parts of paragraph 2.

4. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1 point (iii), the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by Estonia shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Estonia shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92 (3) (a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Joint Committee shall, taking into account the economic situation of Estonia, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of three years.

(b) Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid, inter alia by reporting annually to the other Party on the total amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing, upon request, information on aid schemes. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid.

5. With regard to products referred to in Chapters II and III of Title II:

- the provision of paragraph 1 point (iii) does not apply,

- any practices contrary to paragraph 1 point (i) should be assessed according to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular of those established in Council Regulation No 26.

6. If the Community or Estonia considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of the first paragraph of this Article, and

- is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred to in paragraph 3, or

- in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interests of the other Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its services industry,

it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Joint Committee or after 30 working days following referral for such consultation.

In the case of practices incompatible with paragraph 1 point (iii) of this Article, such appropriate measures may, where the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade applies thereto, only be adopted in conformity with the procedures and under the conditions laid down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and any other relevant instrument negotiated under its auspices which are applicable between the Parties.

7. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary adopted in conformity with paragraph 3, the Parties shall exchange information taking into account the limitations imposed by the requirements of professional and business secrecy.

Article 33

1. The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures including measures relating to imports for balance of payments purposes. In the event of their introduction, the Party having introduced the same shall present to the other Party as soon as possible, a time schedule for their removal.

2. Where one or more Member States or Estonia is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Community or Estonia, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community or Estonia, as the case may be, shall inform the other Party forthwith.

Article 34

With regard to public undertakings, and undertakings to which special or exclusive rights have been granted, the Joint Committee shall ensure that as from the fourth year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, notably Article 90, and the principles of the concluding document of the April 1990 Bonn meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, notably entrepreneurs' freedom of decision, are upheld.

Technical assistance shall be provided where appropriate.

3. The Parties will provide mutual administrative assistance in accordance with the provisions of Protocol 5.

Article 36

1. The Parties recognize that an important condition for the establishment of free trade between Estonia and the Community and the further economic integration of the former into the Community is the approximation of Estonia's existing and future legislation to that of the Community. Estonia shall endeavour to ensure that its trade and trade-related legislation will be gradually made compatible with that of the Community.

2. The approximation of laws shall extend to the following areas in particular: dumping, rules on competition, customs legislation, technical rules and standards.

3. The Community shall provide Estonia with technical assistance for the implementation of these measures, which may include inter alia:

- the exchange of experts,

- the provision of early information especially on relevant legislation,

Article 3

1. Imports into the Community of textile products covered by this Protocol shall not be subject to the quantitative limits established under this Protocol, provided that they are declared to be for re-export outside the Community in the same state or after processing, within the framework of the administrative system of control which exists within the Community.

However, the release for home use of products imported into the Community under the conditions referred to above shall be subject to the production of an export licence issued by the authorities of Estonia, and to proof of origin in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A.

2. Where the Community authorities ascertain that imports of textile products have been set off against a quantitative limit established under this Protocol, but that the products have subsequently been re-exported outside the Community, the authorities shall inform the Estonian authorities within four weeks of the quantities involved and authorize imports of identical quantities of the same products, which shall not be set off against the quantitative limit established under this Protocol for the current or the following year, as appropriate.

3. The Community and Estonia recognize the special and differential character of reimports of textile products into the Community after processing in Estonia as a specific form of industrial and trade cooperation.

Should quantitative limits be established under Article 5, provided that they are effected in accordance with the regulations on economic outward processing in force in the Community, these reimports shall not be subject to these quantitative limits if they are subject to the specific arrangements laid down in Appendix C.

Article 4

Should quantitative limits be introduced under Article 5, the following provisions shall apply:

1. In any Protocol year advance use of a portion of the quantitative limit established for the following Protocol year is authorized for each category of products up to 5 % of the quantitative limit for the current Protocol year.

Article 5

1. Exports of textile products listed in Annex I to this Protocol may be made subject to quantitative limits on the conditions laid down in the following paragraphs.

2. Should imports of textile products originating in Estonia and covered by this Protocol take place in such increased quantities, or under such conditions, so as to cause serious damage or actual threat thereof to the Community's production of like or directly competitive products, the Community may request consultations under Article 15 of this Protocol with a view to reaching agreement or an appropriate quantitative limit for the textile category in question.

3. Pending a mutually satisfactory solution, Estonia undertakes, from the date of notification of the request for consultations, to suspend or limit at the level indicated by the Community, exports of the category of products in question to the Community or the region or regions of the Community market specified by the Community.

The Community shall authorize the importation of products of the said category shipped from Estonia before the date on which the request for consultations was submitted.

4. Should the Parties be unable in the course of consultations to reach a satisfactory solution within the period specified in Article 15, the Community shall have the right to introduce a definitive quantitative limit at an annual level not lower than 106 % of the level of imports reached during the calendar year preceding that in which the imports gave rise to the request for consultations.

The annual level so fixed shall be revised upwards after consultations in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15, should the trend of total imports into the Community of the product in question make this necessary.

5. The annual growth rate for the quantitative limits introduced under this Article shall be fixed by agreement between the Parties in accordance with the consultation procedures established in Article 15.

6. In the event of the provisions of paragraphs 2, 3 or 4 being applied, Estonia undertakes to issue export licences for products covered by contracts concluded before the introduction of the quantitative limit, up to the volume of the quantitative limit fixed.

7. Up to the date of communication of the statistics referred to in Article 12 (6), the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply on the basis of the annual statistics previously communicated by the Community.

Article 6

1. In view of ensuring the effective functioning of this Protocol, the Community and Estonia agreed to cooperate fully in order to prevent, to investigate and to take any necessary legal and/or administrative action against circumvention by transhipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning the country or place of origin, falsification of documents, false declaration concerning fibre content, quantities description or classification of merchandise and by whatever other means. Accordingly, the Community and Estonia agree to establish the necessary legal provisions and administrative procedures permitting effective action to be taken against such circumvention, which shall include the adoption of legally binding corrective measures against exporters and/or importers involved.

2. Should the Community believe on the basis of information available that the present Protocol is being circumvented, the Community will consult with Estonia with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution. These consultations will be held as early as possible and at the latest within 30 days from the date of request.

3. Pending the results of the consultations referred to in paragraph 2, Estonia shall, as a precautionary measure, if so requested by the Community, take all necessary measures to ensure that, where sufficient evidence of circumvention is provided, adjustments of quantitative limits established under Article 5 liable to be agreed following the consultations referred to in paragraph 2 may be carried out for the quota year in which the request to open consultations in accordance with paragraph 2 was made, or for the following year if the quota for the current year is exhausted.

4. Should the Parties be unable, in the course of the consultation referred to in paragraph 2 to reach a mutually satisfactory solution, the Community shall have the right:

(a) Where there is sufficient evidence that products originating in Estonia have been imported in circumvention of the present Protocol, to set off the relevant quantities against the quantitative limits established under Article 5;

(b) Where sufficient evidence shows that a false declaration concerning fibre content, quantities, description or classification of products originating in Estonia has occurred, to refuse to import the products in question;

(c) Should it appear that the territory of Estonia is involved in transhipment or re-routing of products not originating in Estonia, to introduce quantitative limits against the same products originating in Estonia if they are not already subject to quantitative limits, or to take any other appropriate measures.

5. The Parties agree to establish a system of administrative cooperation to prevent and to address effectively all problems arising from circumvention in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A of this Protocol.

Article 7

1. The quantitative limits established under this Protocol on imports into the Community of textile products of Estonian origin will not be broken down by the Community into regional shares.

2. The Parties shall cooperate in order to prevent sudden and prejudicial changes in traditional trade flows resulting in regional concentration of direct imports into the Community.

3. Estonia shall monitor its exports of products under restraint or surveillance into the Community. Should a sudden and prejudicial change in traditional trade flows arise, the Community will be entitled to request consultations in order to find a satisfactory solution to those problems. Such consultations must be held within 15 working days of their being requested by the Community.

4. Estonia shall endeavour to ensure that exports of textile products subject to quantitative limits into the Community are spaced out as evenly as possible over the year, due account being taken in particular of seasonal factors.

Article 8

In the event of denunciation of this Protocol as provided for in Article 18 (1), the quantitative limits established pursuant to this Protocol shall be reduced on a pro rata temporis basis unless the Parties decide otherwise by common agreement.

Article 9

Estonian exports of cottage-industry fabrics woven on hand or foot-operated looms, garments or other made-up articles obtained manually from such fabrics and of traditional folklore handicraft products shall not be subject to quantitative limits, provided that these products originating in Estonia meet the conditions laid down in Appendix B.

Article 10

1. Should the Community consider that a textile product covered by this Protocol is being imported into the Community from Estonia at a price abnormally lower than the normal competitive level and is for this reason causing or threatening to cause serious injury to Community producers of like or directly competitive products, it may request consultations under Article 15, and in that event the following specific provisions shall be applicable.

2. If following such consultations it is acknowledged by common accord that the situation described in paragraph 1 exists, Estonia shall take, within the limits of its powers, the necessary steps, notably as regards the price at which the product in question will be sold, to remedy the situation.

3. In order to determine whether the price of a textile product is abnormally lower than the normal competitive level, it may be compared with:

- the prices generally charged for like products sold under the ordinary conditions by other exporting countries on the market of the importing country,

- the prices of like national products at a comparable marketing stage on the market of the importing country,

- the lowest prices charged by a third country for the same product in the course of ordinary commercial dealings in the three months preceding the request for consultations, and not having led to the adoption of any measure by the Community.

4. Should the consultations referred to in paragraph 2 above fail to lead to agreement within 30 days of the Community's request for consultations, the Community may, until these consultations have produced a mutually satisfactory solution, temporarily refuse consignments of the product in question at prices under the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 above.

5. In totally exceptional and critical circumstances, where consignments of products are being imported from Estonia into the Community at prices abnormally lower than the normal competitive level, such as to cause injury which it would be difficult to repair, the Community may temporarily suspend imports of the products concerned pending agreement on a solution in the course of consultations, which shall be opened immediately. The Parties shall do their utmost to reach a mutually acceptable solution within 10 working days' notice of the opening of such consultations.

6. Should the Community have recourse to the measures referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, Estonia may at any time request the opening of consultations to examine the possibility of eliminating or modifying these measures where the causes which made them necessary no longer exist.

Article 11

1. The classification of the products covered by this Protocol is based on the tariff and statistical nomenclature of the Community (hereinafter called the 'combined nomenclature', or in abbreviated form 'CN') and any amendments thereof.

Where any decision on classification results in a change of classification practice or a change of category of any product subject to this Protocol, the affected products shall follow the trade regime applicable to the practice or category they fall into after such changes.

Any amendment to the combined nomenclature (CN) made in accordance with the procedures in force in the Community concerning categories of products covered by this Protocol or any decision relating to the classification of goods shall not have the effect of reducing quantitative limits introduced pursuant to this Protocol.

2. The origin of the products covered by this Protocol shall be determined in accordance with the rules in force in the Community.

Any amendment to these rules of origin shall be communicated to Estonia and shall not have the effect of reducing any quantitative limit established pursuant to this Protocol.

The procedures for control of the origin of the products referred to above are laid down in Appendix A.

Article 12

1. Estonia shall supply the Commission of the European Communities with precise statistical information on all export licences issued for categories of textile products subject to the quantitative limits established under this Protocol, or to a double-checking system expressed in quantities and in terms of value and broken down by Member States of the Community, as well as on all certificates, issued by the competent Estonian authorities for products referred to in Article 9 and subject to the provisions of Appendix B.

2. The competent authorities of the Community undertake to inform the competent authorities of Estonia of any decisions relating to the classification of products subject to the present Protocol, within one month of their adoption at the latest. Such communication shall include:

(a) a description of the products concerned;

(b) the relevant category and the related CN codes;

(c) the reasons which have led to the decision.

3. Where a decision on classification results in a change of classification practice or a change of category of any product subject to the Protocol, the competent authorities of the Community shall provide 30 days' notice, from the date of the Community's communication, before the decision is put into effect. Products shipped before the date of entry into effect of the decision shall remain subject to the earlier classification practice, provided that the goods in question are presented for importation into the Community within 60 days of that date.

4. Where a Community decision on classification resulting in a change of classification practice or a change of categorization of any product subject to the Protocol affects a category subject to quantitative limits, the Parties agree to enter into consultation in accordance with the procedures described in Article 15 of the Protocol with a view to honouring the obligation under the second subparagraph of Article 11 (1) of the Protocol.

5. In case of divergent opinions between the competent Community and Estonian authorities at the point of entry into the Community on the classification of products covered by the present Protocol, classification shall provisionally be based on indications provided by the Community, pending consultations in accordance with Article 15 with a view to reaching agreement on definitive classification of the products concerned.

2. The certificate of origin shall be certified by the competent Estonian organizations authorized under the Estonian legislation if the products in question can be considered products originating in that country within the meaning of the relevant Community rules.

3. However, the products in Groups III, IV and V may be imported into the Community in accordance with the arrangements established by this Protocol on production of a declaration by the exporter on the invoice or other commercial document relating to the products to the effect that the products in question originate in Estonia within the meaning of the relevant Community rules.

4. The certificate of origin referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required for import of goods covered by a movement certificate EUR. 1 or Form EUR. 2 completed in accordance with the relevant Community rules.

Article 3

The certificate of origin shall be issued only on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorized representative. The competent Estonian organizations authorized under Estonian legislation shall ensure that the certificate of origin is properly completed and for this purpose they shall call for any necessary documentary evidence or carry out any check which they consider appropiate.

Article 4

Where different criteria for determining origin are laid down for products falling within the same category, the certificates or declarations of origin must contain a sufficiently detailed description of the goods so as to enable the criterion to be determined, on the basis of which the certificate was issued or the declaration drawn up.

Article 5

The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the certificate of origin and those made in the documents produced to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto cast doubt upon the statements in the certificate.

2. Where quantitative limits have been introduced pursuant to this Protocol, each export licence must certify inter alia that the quantity of the product in question has been set off against the quantitative limit established for the category of the products concerned and shall only cover one category of products subject to quantitative limits. It may be used for one or more consignments of the products in question.

4. The competent authorities of the Community shall cancel the import authorization already issued whenever the corresponding export licence has been withdrawn.

However, if the competent authorities of the Community are notified of the withdrawal or the cancellation of the export licence only after the importation of the products into the Community, the relevant quantities shall be set off against the quantitative limits established for the category and the quota year concerned.

Article 13

1. If the competent authorities of the Community find that the total quantities covered by export licences issued by the competent authorities of Estonia for a particular category in any year exceed the quantitative limit established in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol for that category, as may be modified by Articles 4, 6 and 8 of the Protocol, the said authorities may suspend the further issue of import authorizations. In this event, the competent authorities of the Community shall immediately inform the authorities of Estonia and the special consultation procedure set out in Article 15 of the Protocol shall be initiated forthwith.

2. Exports of products of Estonian origin subject to quantitative limits or double-checking system and not covered by Estonian export licences issued in accordance with the provisions of this Appendix may be refused an import authorization by the competent Community authorities.

However, without prejudice to Article 6 of the Protocol, if the import of such products is allowed into the Community by the competent authorities of the Community, the quantities involved shall not be set off against the appropiate quantitative limits established pursuant to this Protocol, without the express agreement of the competent authorities of Estonia.

Should such verifications reveal systematic irregularities in the use of declarations of origin, the Community may subject imports of the products in question to the provisions of Article 2(1) of this Appendix.

5. For the purpose of subsequent verification of certificates of origin, copies of the certificates as well as any export documents referring to them shall be kept for at least two years by the competent Estonian authorities.

6. Recourse to the random verification procedure specified in this Article must not constitute an obstacle to the release for home use of the products in question.

Article 21

1. Where the verification procedure referred to in Article 20 or where information available to the competent authorities of the Community or of Estonia indicates or appears to indicate that the provisions of this Protocol are being circumvented or infringed, the Parties shall cooperate closely and with the appropriate urgency in order to prevent any such circumvention or infringement.

2. To this end, the competent authorities of Estonia shall, on their own initiative or at the request of the Community, carry out appropriate inquiries, or arrange for such inquiries to be carried out, concerning operations which are, or appear to the Community to be, in circumvention or infringement of this Appendix. Estonia shall communicate the results of these inquiries to the Community, including any other pertinent information enabling the cause of the circumvention or infringement, including the true origin of the goods, to be determined.

3. By agreement between the Community and Estonia, officials designated by the Community may be present at the inquiries referred to in paragraph 2 above.

4. Pursuant to the cooperation referred to in parapraph 1 above, the competent authorities of the Community and Estonia shall exchange any information considered by either Party to be of use in preventing circumvention or infringement of the provisions of this Protocol. These exchanges may include information on the production of textile products in Estonia and on the trade in the type of products covered by this Protocol between Estonia and third countries, particularly where the Community has reasonable grounds to consider that the products in question may be in transit across the territory of Estonia prior to their importation into the Community. This information may include at the request of the Community, copies of all available relevant documentation.

5. Where sufficient evidence shows that the provisions of this Appendix have been circumvented or infringed, the competent authorities of the Community and Estonia may agree to take the measures set out in Article 6(4) of the Protocol, and any other measures as are necessary to prevent a recurrence of such circumvention or infringement.

1. Subject to paragraph 2, only reimports into the Community of products affected by the specific quantitative limits laid down in the Annex to this Appendix shall be considered reimports within the meaning of Article 3 (3) of the Protocol.

2. Reimports not covered by the Annex to this Appendix may be made subject to specific quantitative limits following consultations in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 15 of the Protocol, provided the products concerned are subject to quantitative limits pursuant to the Protocol, to a double-checking system or to surveillance measures.

3. Having regard to the interests of both Parties, the Community may at its discretion, or in response to a request pursuant to Article 15 of the Protocol:

(a) examine the possibility of transferring from one category to another, using in advance or carrying over from one year to the next, portions of specific quantitative limits;

(b) consider the possibility of increasing specific quantitative limits.

OPT QUOTAS COMMUNITY QUANTITATIVE LIMITS

Category (p.m.) Unit (p.m.) Year(s) (p.m.)

Agreed minute No 1

In the context of Protocol 1 on trade in textile and clothing products, the Parties agreed that Article 5 of the Protocol does not preclude the Community, if the conditions are fulfilled, from applying the safeguard measures for one or more of its regions in conformity with the principles of the internal market.

In such an event, Estonia shall be informed in advance of the relevant provisions of Appendix A of the Protocol to be applied, as appropriate.

Agreed minute No 2

Notwithstanding Article 7 (1) of Protocol 1 on trade in textile and clothing products, for imperative technical or administrative reasons or to find a solution to economic problems resulting from regional concentration of imports, or in order to combat circumvention and fraud of the provisions of this Protocol, the Community will establish for a limited period of time a specific management system in conformity with the principles of the Internal Market.

However, if the Parties are unable to reach a satisfactory solution during the consultations provided for in Article 7 (3), Estonia undertakes, if so requested by the Community, to respect temporary export limits for one or more regions of the Community. In such a case, these limits shall not preclude the importation into the region(s) concerned of products which were shipped from Estonia on the basis of export licences obtained before the date of formal notification to Estonia by the Community about the introduction of the above limits.

The Community shall inform Estonia of the technical and administrative measures that need to be introduced by both Parties in order to implement the above paragraphs in conformity with the principles of the internal market.

Agreed minute No 3

In the context of Protocol 1 on trade in textile and clothing products, the Parties agreed that Estonia shall endeavour not to deprive certain regions of the Community which have traditionally had relatively small shares of the Community quotas of import of products serving as inputs for their processing industry.

The Community and Estonia further agreed to hold consultations, should the need arise, in order to avert any problems which might occur in this respect.

Agreed minute No 4

In the context of Protocol 1 on trade in textile and clothing products, Estonia agreed that, from the date of request for and pending the consultations referred to in Article 7 (3), it shall cooperate by not issuing export licences that would further aggravate the problems resulting from the regional concentration of direct imports into the Community.

Agreed minute No 5

In the context of Protocol 1 on trade in textile and clothing products, the Parties agreed that, not later than the beginning of the third year of the application of this Protocol, specific consultations shall be held with the aim of reviewing the application of the double-checking system including, in particular, an examination of the list of products subject to double-checking surveillance.

PROTOCOL 2 on trade between the Community and Estonia in processed agricultural products

Article 1

1. The Community shall grant tariff concessions referred to in Annex 1 for processed agricultural products originating in Estonia. In the case of the goods referred to in Annex II, however, reductions of the agricultural component shall be granted within the quantity limits referred to therein.

2. The Joint Committee may:

- add to the list of processed agricultural products referred to in this Protocol,

- increase the quantities of processed agricultural products eligible for the tariff concessions established by this Protocol.

3. The Joint Committee may replace the concessions with a system of compensatory amounts with no quantity limits, established on the basis of the differences found between the prices on the Community and Estonian markets of the agricultural products actually used to produce the processed agricultural products covered by this Protocol. The Joint Committee shall draw up a list of products to which the compensatory amounts are applicable and a list of basic products. It shall adopt general implementing rules to that end.

Article 2

For the purpose of this Protocol, the following definitions shall apply:

- 'goods' means the processed agricultural products referred to in this Protocol,

- 'agricultural component' means the part of the charge corresponding to the difference between the prices on the internal market of the Parties of the agricultural products considered to have been used for the production of the goods and the prices of those agricultural products incorporated in imports from third countries,

- 'non-agricultural component' means the part of the charge remaining when the agricultural component is deducted from the total charge,

- 'basic products' means the agricultural products considered as having been used in the production of goods within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93,

- 'base quantity' means the quantity of a basic product calculated in the manner stipulated in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 and which is used to determine the agricultural component applicable to goods of a given type, in accordance with the terms of the same Regulation.

Article 3

1. The Community grants to Estonia the following concessions:

- the non-agricultural component of the charge shall be reduced as per Annex I,

- for the goods for which Annex I stipulates a reduced agricultural component (MOBR) the level of the latter shall be calculated by reducing the base quantities of the basic products for which a levy reduction is granted by 20 % in 1995, 40 % in 1996 and 60 % from 1997. For the other basic products of those goods, the corresponding reductions, for the same years, shall be 10 %, 20 % and 30 %. These reductions shall be granted within the limits of tariff quotas stipulated in Annex II. For quantities in excess of those quotas the agricultural component applicable to third countries shall apply.

2. The agricultural components shall be replaced by reduced agricultural components in the case of goods added in accordance with the procedure described in Article 1 (2).

Article 4

Estonia shall apply the duties applicable on 1 January 1995 to imports of processed agricultural products originating in the Community and falling within Regulation (EC) No 3448/93. However, if Estonia wishes to apply duties in accordance with Article 18 (2) and (3) of this Agreement, Estonia shall refer them to the Joint Committee. Estonia shall distinguish between the agricultural component and the non-agricultural component of the duties within two years of the entry into force of this Agreement. Estonia shall remove the non-agricultural component of the duties so distinguished within three years of the date of distinguishing between the duties components, in three equal annual steps. The agricultural component of the duty shall be reduced by the Joint Committee along the same principles indicated in Article 3 (1) second indent of this Protocol.

Article 3

Bilateral cumulation

1. Notwithstanding Article 2 (1) (b), materials originating in Estonia within the meaning of this Protocol shall be considered as materials originating in the Community and it shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing there, provided however that they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 7 of this Protocol.

2. Notwithstanding Article 2 (2) (b), materials originating in the Community within the meaning of this Protocol shall be considered as materials originating in Estonia and it shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone working or processing there, provided however that they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 7 of this Protocol.

2. Products which have acquired originating status by virtue of paragraph 1 shall only continue to be considered as originating in the Community or in Estonia, when the value added there exceeds the value of the materials used originating in Latvia or Lithuania.

If this is not so, the products concerned shall be considered for the purposes of implementing this Agreement or of the Agreement between the Community and Latvia and Lithuania as originating in Latvia or Lithuania according to which of these countries accounts for the highest value of originating materials used.

3. For the purposes of this Article, identical rules of origin to those in this Protocol shall be applied in trade between the Community and Latvia and Lithuania and between Estonia and those two countries and also between each of these three countries themselves.

Article 5

Wholly obtained products

1. Within the meaning of Article 2 (1) (a) and (2) (a), the following shall be considered as wholly obtained either in the Community or in Estonia:

(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;

(b) vegetable products harvested there;

(c) live animals born and raised there;

(d) products from live animals raised there;

(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing there;

(f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by their vessels;

(g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);

(h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or use as waste;

(i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;

(j) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;

(k) goods produced exclusively from products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (j).

2. The term 'their vessels' and 'their factory ships' in paragraph 1 (f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:

- which are registered or recorded in Estonia or in a Member State of the Community,

- which sail under the flag of Estonia or of a Member State of the Community,

- which are owned to an extent of at least 50 % by nationals of Estonia or of a Member State of the Community, or by a company with its head office in one of these States or in Estonia, of which the manager or managers, chairman of the board of directors or the supervisory board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of Estonia or of Member States of the Community and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to these States, to Estonia, to their public bodies or to their nationals,

- of which the master and officers are nationals of Estonia or of Member States of the Community,

- of which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of Estonia or of Member States of the Community.

3. The terms 'Estonia' and 'the Community' shall also cover the territorial waters which surround Estonia and the Member States of the Community.

Sea-going vessels, including factory ships on which the fish caught is worked or processed, shall be considered as part of the territory of the Community or of Estonia provided that they satisfy the conditions set out in paragraph 2.

Article 6

Sufficiently worked or processed products

1. For the purposes of Article 2, non-originating materials are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the product obtained is classified in a heading which is different from that in which all the non-originating materials used in its manufacture are classified, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3.

2. For a product mentioned in columns 1 and 2 of the list in Annex II, the conditions set out in column 3 for the product concerned must be fulfilled instead of the rule in paragraph 1.

Where in the list in Annex II a percentage rule is applied in determining the originating status of a product obtained in the Community or in Estonia the value added by the working or processing shall correspond to the ex-works price of the product obtained, less the value of third-country materials imported into the Community or Estonia.

3. These conditions indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of these products, and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list for that product, is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

Article 7

Insufficient working or processing operations

For the purpose of implementing Article 6 the following shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not there is a change of heading:

(a) operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);

(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;

(c) (i) changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of packages;

(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packaging operations;

(d) affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;

(e) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds, where one or more components of the mixture do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating in the Community or in Estonia;

(f) simple assembly of parts to constitute a complete product;

(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);

(h) slaughter of animals.

Article 8

Unit of qualification

1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.

Accordingly, it follows that:

(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonized System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;

(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.

2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.

Article 9

Accessories, spare parts and tools

Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.

Article 10

Sets

Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.

Article 11

Neutral elements

In order to determine whether a product originates in the Community or in Estonia, it shall not be necessary to establish whether the electrical energy, fuel, plant and equipment as well as machines and tools used to obtain such product, or whether any goods, used in the course of production which do not enter and which were not intended to enter into the final composition of the product, are originating or not.

TITLE III TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS

Article 12

Principle of territoriality

The conditions set out in Title II relative to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or in Estonia without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 3 or 4.

Article 13

Reimportation of goods

If originating products exported from the Community or Estonia to another country are returned, except in so far as provided for in Articles 3 or 4 they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(a) the goods returned are the same goods as those exported; and

(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.

Article 14

Direct transport

1. The preferential treatment provided for under the Agreement applies only to products or materials which are transported between the territories of the Community and Estonia or, when the provisions of Article 4 are applied, of Latvia or Lithuania without entering any other territory. However, goods originating in Estonia or in the Community and constituting one single consignment which is not split up may be transported through territory other than that of the Community or Estonia or, when the provisions of Article 4 apply, of Latvia or Lithuania with, should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territory, provided that the goods have remained under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or of warehousing and that they have not undergone operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.

Products originating in Estonia or in the Community may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the Community or that of Estonia.

2. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled may be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:

(a) a through bill of lading issued in the exporting country covering the passage through the country of transit; or

(b) a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:

(i) giving an exact description of the products;

(ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships used; and

(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or

(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.

Article 15

Exhibitions

1. Products sent from one of the Contracting Parties for exhibition in a third country and sold after the exhibition for importation in another Party shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement on condition that the products meet the requirements of this Protocol entitling them to be recognized as originating in the Community or in Estonia and provided that it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(a) an exporter has consigned these products from one of the Contracting Parties to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;

(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in another Contracting Party;

(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter to the latter Contracting Party in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and

(d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.

2. A proof of origin must be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title IV and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing State in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the nature of the products and the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.

3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organized for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.

The movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of Estonia, if the goods to be exported can be considered as products originating in Estonia within the meaning of Article 2 (2) of this Protocol.

5. Where the cumulation provisions of Articles 2 to 4 are applied, the customs authorities of the Member State of the Community or of Estonia may issue movement certificates EUR.1 under the conditions laid down in this Protocol if the goods to be exported can be considered as originating products within the meaning of this Protocol and provided that the goods covered by the movement certificates EUR.1 are in the Community or in Estonia.

Article 21

Simplified procedure for the issue of certificates

1. By way derogation from Articles 17, 18 and 19 of this Protocol, a simplified procedure for the issue of EUR.1 movement certificates can be used in accordance with the following provisions.

2. The customs authorities in the exporting State may authorize any exporter, hereinafter referred to as 'approved exporter', making frequent shipments for which EUR.1 movement certificates may be issued and who offers, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products, not to submit to the customs office of the application for an EUR.1 certificate relating to those goods, for the purpose of obtaining an EUR.1 certificate under the conditions laid down in Article 17 of this Protocol.

3. The authorization referred to in paragraph 2 shall stipulate, at the choice of the competent authorities, that box No 11 'Customs endorsement' of the EUR.1 movement certificate must:

(a) either be endorsed beforehand with the stamp of the competent customs office of the exporting State and the signature, which may be a facsimile, of an official of that office; or

(b) be endorsed by the approved exporter with a special stamp which has been approved by the customs authorities of the exporting State and corresponds to the specimen given in Annex V of this Protocol. Such stamp may be pre-printed on the forms.

4. In the cases referred to in paragraph 3 (a), one of the following phrases shall be entered in box No 7 'Remarks' of the EUR.1 movement certificate: 'PROCEDIMIENTO SIMPLIFICADO', 'FORENKLET PROCEDURE', 'VEREINFACHTES VERFAHREN', 'ÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃ ÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃ', 'SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURE', 'PROCEDURE SIMPLIFIEE', 'PROCEDURA SEMPLIFICATA', 'VEREENVOUDIGDE PROCEDURE', 'PROCEDIMENTO SIMPLIFICADO', 'LIHTSUSTATUD PROTSEDUUR'.

5. Box No 11 'Customs endorsement' of the EUR.1 certificate shall be completed if necessary by the approved exporter.

6. The approved exporter shall, if necessary, indicate in box No 13 'Request for verification' of the EUR.1 certificate the name and address of the authority competent to verify such a certificate.

7. Where the simplified procedure is applied, the customs authorities of the exporting State may prescribe the use of EUR.1 certificates bearing a distinctive sign by which they may be identified.

8. In the authorization referred to in paragraph 2 the competent authorities shall specify in particular:

(a) the conditions under which the applications for EUR.1 certificates are to be made;

(b) the conditions under which these applications are to be kept for at least three years;

(c) in the cases referred to in paragraph 3 (b) the authority competent to carry out the subsequent verification referred to in Article 30 of this Protocol.

9. The customs authorities of the exporting State may declare certain categories of goods ineligible for the special treatment provided for in paragraph 2.

10. The customs authorities shall refuse the authorization referred to in paragraph 2 to exporters who do not offer all the guarantees which they consider necessary. The competent authorities may withdraw the authorization at any time. They must do so where the approved exporter no longer satisfies the conditions or no longer offers these guarantees.

11. The approved exporter may be required to inform the competent authorities, in accordance with the rules which they lay down, of the goods to be dispatched by him, so that such authorities may make any verification they think necessary before the departure of the goods.

12. The customs authorities of the exporting State may carry out any check on approved exporters which they consider necessary. Such exporters must allow this to be done.

13. The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to the application of the rules of the Community, the Member States and Estonia concerning customs formalities and the use of customs documents.

Article 22

Validity of proof of origin

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting State, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing State.

2. Movement certificates EUR.1 which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing State after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to reasons of force majeure or exceptional circumstances.

3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing State may accept the movement certificates EUR.1 where the products have been submitted to them before the said final date.

Article 23

Submission of proof of origin

Movement certificates EUR.1 shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing State in accordance with the procedures applicable in that State. The said authorities may require a translation of a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration. They may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of the Agreement.

Article 24

Importation by instalments

Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing State, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of general rule 2 (a) of the Harmonized System falling within Chapters 84 and 85 of the Harmonized System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.

Article 25

Form EUR.2

1. Notwithstanding Article 16, the evidence of originating status, within the meaning of this Protocol, for consignments containing only originating products and whose value does not exceed ECU 3 000 per consignment, may be given by a form EUR.2, a specimen of which appears in Annex IV to this Protocol.

2. The form EUR.2 shall be completed and signed by the exporter or, under the exporters responsibility, by his authorized representative in accordance with this Protocol.

3. A form EUR.2 shall be completed for each consignment.

4. The exporter who applied for the form EUR.2 shall submit at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting State all supporting documents concerning the use of this form.

Article 26

Exemptions from formal proof of origin

1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a formal proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration C2/CP3 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.

2. Imports which are occasional and consists solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.

3. Furthermore, the total value of these products must not exceed ECU 300 in the case of small packages or ECU 800 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.

Article 27

Discrepancies and formal errors

1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in a movement certificate EUR.1 or in a form EUR.2 and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the movement certificate EUR.1, or the form EUR.2 null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.

2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a movement certificate EUR.1, or a form EUR.2 should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.

Article 28

Amounts expressed in ecus

1. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting State equivalent to the amounts expressed in ecus shall be fixed by the exporting State and communicated to the other Party.

When the amounts exceed the corresponding amounts fixed by the importing State, the latter shall accept them if the products are invoiced in the currency of the exporting State or in the currency of one of the other States referred to in Article 4 of this Protocol.

If the goods are invoiced in the currency of another Member State of the Community the importing State shall recognize the amount notified by the country concerned.

2. Up to and including 30 April 2000, the amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the amounts expressed in ecus as at 1 October 1994.

For each successive period of five years, the amounts expressed in ecus and their equivalents in the national currencies of the States shall be reviewed by the Joint Committee on the basis of the exchange rates of the ecu as at the first working day in October in the year immediately preceding that five-year period.

When carrying out this review, the Joint Committee shall ensure that there will be no decrease in the amounts to be used in any national currency and shall furthermore consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in ecus.

ANNEX I

INTRODUCTORY NOTES

Foreword

These notes shall apply, where appropriate, to all manufactured products using non-originating materials, even if they are not subject to specific conditions contained in the list in Annex II but are subject instead to the change of heading rule set out in Article 6 (1).

Note 1

1.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number, or the chapter number, used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rule in column 3 only applies to the part of that heading or chapter as described in column 2.

1.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of product in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in column 3 applies to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified within headings of the chapter or within any of the headings grouped together in column 1.

1.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rule in column 3.

Note 2

2.1. In the case of any heading not in the list or any part of a heading that is not in the list, the 'change of heading' rule set out in Article 6 (1) applies. If a 'change of heading' condition applies to any entry in the list, then it is contained in the rule in column 3.

2.2. The working or processing required by a rule in column 3 has to be carried out only in relation to the non-originating materials used. The restrictions contained in a rule in column 3 likewise apply only to the non-originating materials used.

2.3. Where a rule states that 'materials of any heading' may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression 'manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No . . .' means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.

2.4. If a product made from non-originating materials which has acquired originating status during manufacture by virtue of the change of heading rule or its own list rule is used as a material in the process of manufacture of another product, then the rule applicable to the product in which it is incorporated does not apply to it.

For example:

An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from 'other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of heading No 7224.

If this forging has been forged in the country concerned from a non-originating ingot then the forging has already acquired origin by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. It can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or another. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.

2.5. Even if the change of heading rule or the other rules contained in the list are satisfied, a product shall not acquire originating status if the processing carried out, taken as a whole, is insufficient within the meaning of Article 7.

Note 3

3.1. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer origin. Thus if a rule says that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.

3.2. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.

For example:

The rule for fabrics say that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; one can use one or the other or both.

If, however, a restriction applies to one material and other restrictions apply to other materials in the same rule, then the restrictions only apply to the materials actually used.

For example:

The rule for sewing machines specifies that both the thread tension mechanism used and the zigzag mechanism used must originate; these two restrictions only apply if the mechanisms concerned are actually incorporated into the sewing machine.

3.3. When a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.

For example:

The rule for heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals or their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not produced from cereals.

For example:

In the case of an article made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.

See also Note 6.3 in relation to textiles.

3.4. If in a rule in the list two or more percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. The maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.

Note 4

4.1. The term 'natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres and is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, the term 'natural fibres' includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.

4.2. The term 'natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.

4.3. The terms 'textile pulp', 'chemical materials' and 'paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.

4.4. The term 'man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings Nos 5501 to 5507.

Note 5

5.1. In the case of the products classified within those headings in the list to which a reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 of the list shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in their manufacture which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (but see also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).

5.2. However, this tolerance may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:

- silk,

- wool,

- coarse animal hair,

- fine animal hair,

- horsehair,

- cotton,

- paper-making materials and paper,

- flax,

- true hemp,

- jute and other textile bast fibres,

- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,

- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,

- synthetic man-made filaments,

- artificial man-made filaments,

- synthetic man-made staple fibres,

- artificial man-made staple fibres.

For example:

A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the yarn.

For example:

A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the fabric.

For example:

Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.

For example:

If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.

For example:

A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight taken together does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the textile materials in the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.

5.3. In the case of fabrics incorporating 'yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.

5.4. In the case of fabrics incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two films of plastic film, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.

Note 6

6.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials with the exception of linings and interlinings which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.

6.2. Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely, whether or not they contain textiles.

Example:

If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.

6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

Note 7

7.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the 'specific processes' are the following:

(a) vacuum distillation;

(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1);

(c) cracking;

(d) reforming;

(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;

(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;

(g) polymerization;

(h) alkylation;

(i) isomerization.

7.2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the 'specific processes' are the following:

(a) vacuum distillation;

(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;

(c) cracking;

(d) reforming;

(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;

(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;

(g) polymerization;

(h) alkylation;

(ij) isomerization;

(k) (in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only) desulphurization with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);

(l) (in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only) deparaffining by a process other than filtering;

(m) (in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only) treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 Â°C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;

(n) (in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only) atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 Â°C by the ASTM D 86 method;

PROTOCOL 5 on mutual assistance between administrative authorities in customs matters

Article 1

Definitions

For the purposes of this Protocol:

(a) 'customs legislation' shall mean provisions adopted by the Community and Estonia, governing the import, export, transit of goods and their placing under any customs procedure, including measures of prohibition, restriction and control;

(b) 'customs duties' shall mean all duties, taxes, fees or other charges which are levied and collected in the territories of the Parties, in application of customs legislation, but not including fees and charges which are limited in amount to the approximate costs of services rendered;

(c) 'applicant authority' shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been appointed by a Party for this purpose and which makes a request for assistance in customs matters;

(d) 'requested authority' shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been appointed by a Party for this purpose and which receives a request for assistance in customs matters;

(e) 'contravention' shall mean any violation of the customs legislation as well as any attempted violation of such legislation.

Article 2

Scope

1. The Parties shall assist each other, within their competences, in the manner and under the conditions laid down in this Protocol, in ensuring that customs legislation is correctly applied, in particular by the prevention, detection and investigation of contraventions of this legislation.

2. Assistance in customs matters, as provided for in this Protocol, applies to any administrative authority of the Parties which is competent for the application of this Protocol. It shall not prejudice the rules governing mutual assistance in criminal matters. Nor shall it cover information obtained under powers exercised at the request of the judicial authority, unless those authorities so agree.

Article 3

Assistance on request

1. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall furnish it with all relevant information to enable it to ensure that customs legislation is correctly applied, including information regarding operations noted or planned which contravene or would contravene such legislation.

3. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall take the necessary steps to ensure that a surveillance is kept on:

(a) natural or legal persons of whom there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are contravening or have contravened customs legislation;

(b) places where stocks of goods have been assembled in such a way that there are reasonable grounds for supposing that they are intended as supplies for operations contrary to the legislation of the other Party;

(c) movements of goods notified as possibly giving rise to substantial contraventions of customs legislation;

(d) means of transport for which there are reasonable grounds for believing that they have been, are or may be used in the contravening of customs legislation.

Article 4

Spontaneous assistance

Without prior request, the Parties shall provide each other, in accordance with their laws, rules and other legal instruments, with assistance if they consider that to be necessary for the correct application of customs legislation, particularly when they obtain information pertaining to:

- operations which have contravened, contravene or would contravene such legislation and which may be of interest to the other Party,

- new means or methods employed in realizing such operations,

- goods known to be subject to substantial contravention of customs legislation.

falling within the scope of this Protocol to an addressee, residing or established in its territory. In such a case Article 6 (3) is applicable.

Article 6

Form and substance of requests for assistance

1. Requests pursuant to this Protocol shall be made in writing. Documents necessary for the execution of such requests shall accompany the request. When required because of the urgency of the situation, oral requests may be accepted, but must be confirmed in writing immediately.

2. Requests pursuant to paragraph 1 shall include the following information:

(a) the applicant authority making the request;

(b) the measure requested;

(c) the object of and the reason for the request;

(d) the laws, rules and other legal elements involved;

3. Requests shall be submitted in an official language of the requested authority or in a language acceptable to such authority.

4. If a request does not meet the formal requirements, its correction or completion may be demanded; the ordering of precautionary measures may, however, take place.

Article 7

Execution of requests

1. In order to comply with a request for assistance, the requested authority or, when the latter cannot act on its own, the administrative department to which the request has been addressed by this authority, shall proceed, within its competence and available resources, as though it were acting on its own account or at the request of other authorities of that same Party, by supplying information already possessed, by carrying out appropriate enquiries or by arranging for them to be carried out.

2. Requests for assistance will be executed in accordance with the laws, rules and other legal instruments of the requested Party.

3. Duly authorized officials of a Party may, with the agreement of the other Party involved and within the conditions laid down by the latter, obtain from the offices of the requested authority or other authority for which the requested authority is responsible, information relating to the contravention of customs legislation which the applicant authority needs for the purposes of this Protocol.

(b) involve currency or tax regulations other than regulations concerning customs duties; or

(c) violate an industrial, commercial or professional secret.

2. Where the applicant authority asks for assistance which it would itself be unable to provide if so asked, it shall draw attention to that fact in its request. It shall then be left to the requested authority to decide how to respond to such a request.

3. If assistance is withheld or denied, the decision and the reasons therefor must be notified to the applicant authority without delay.

Article 10

Obligation to observe confidentiality

1. Any information communicated in whatsoever form pursuant to this Protocol shall be of a confidential nature. It shall be covered by the obligation of official secrecy and shall enjoy the protection extended to like information under the relevant legislation of the Party which received it and the corresponding provisions applying to the Community authorities.

2. Nominative data shall not be transmitted whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that the transfer or the use made of the data transmitted would be contrary to the basic legal principles of one of the Parties, and, in particular, if the person concerned would suffer undue disadvantages. Upon request, the receiving Party shall inform the furnishing Party of the use made of the information supplied and of the results achieved.

3. Nominative data may only be transmitted to customs authorities and, in the case of need for prosecution purposes, to public prosecution and judicial authorities. Other persons or authorities may obtain such information only upon previous authorization by the furnishing authority.

These provisions are not applicable when the information obtained for the purposes of this Protocol could also be used for the purposes of fighting against illicit traffic related to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Such information may be communicated to other authorities directly involved in the combating of illicit drug traffic, within the limits of Article 2.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not impede the use of information in any judicial or administrative proceedings subsequently instituted for failure to comply with customs legislation.
