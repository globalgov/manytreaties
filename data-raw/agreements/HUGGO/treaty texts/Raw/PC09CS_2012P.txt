evaluate and consider, as appropriate, the following factors:a. characteristics and composition of the emissions1 type and size of point or diffuse source (e.g. industrial process);2 type of emissions (e.g. origin, average composition);3 state of waste (e.g. solid, liquid, sludge, slurry);4 total amount (volume discharged, e.g. per year);5 discharge pattern (continuous, intermittent, seasonally variable, etc.);6 concentrations with respect to relevant constituents of substances listed in annex i and of other substances as appropriate;7 physical, chemical and biochemical properties of the waste effluents.b. characteristics of emission constituents with respect to their harmfulness1 persistence (physical, chemical, biological) in the marine environment;2 toxicity and other harmful effects;3 accumulation in biological materials or sediments;4 biochemical transformation producing harmful compounds;5 adverse effects on the oxygen content and balance;6 susceptibility to physical, chemical and biochemical changes and interaction in the aquatic environment with other seawater constituents which may produce harmful biological or other effects on any of the uses listed in section f below;7 all other characteristics as listed in annex i, section c.c. characteristics of emission site and receiving environment1. hydrographic, meteorological, geological and topographical characteristics of the coastal area;2. location and type of the source (outfall, canal outlet, etc.) and its relation to other areas (such as amenity areas, spawning, nursery, and fishing areas, shellfish grounds) and other emissions;3. initial dilution achieved at the point of emission into the receiving environment;4. dispersion characteristics such as effects of currents, tides and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing;5. receiving water characteristics with respect to physical, chemical, biological and ecological conditions in the discharge area;6. capacity of the receiving marine environment to receive waste effluents without undesirable effects.d. characteristics of the activity or source category1 performance of existing technologies and management practices, including indigenous technologies and management practices;2 age of facilities, as appropriate;3 existing economic, social and cultural characteristics.e. alternative production, waste treatment technologies or management practices1 recycling, recovery and reuse opportunities;2 less hazardous or non-hazardous raw material substitution;3 substitution of cleaner alternative activities or products;4 low-waste or clean technologies or processes;5 alternative disposal activities (for example on land disposal).f. potential impairment of marine ecosystems and seawater uses1. effects on human health through pollution impact on:(a) edible marine organisms;(b) bathing waters; and(c) aesthetics.1 effects on marine and coastal ecosystems, in particular living resources, endangered species and critical habitats.2 effects on other legitimate uses of the sea ANNEX vguidelines on "best available techniques and best environmental practice"in accordance with relevant provisions of this protocol the contracting parties will utilise or promote the application of best available techniques (bat) and best environmental practice (bep).a. best available techniques1. the term "best available techniques" means the latest stage of development (state of the art) of processes, facilities or methods of operation, which indicate the practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting emissions and waste. "techniques" include both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and dismantled.2. the use of the best available techniques shall emphasize the use of non-waste technology, if available.3. in determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of operation constitute the best available techniques in general or individual cases, special consideration shall be given to:(a) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have recently been successfully tried out;(b) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(c) the economic feasibility of such techniques;(d) time limits for installation in both new and existing plants;(e) the nature and volume of the emissions concerned;(f) the precautionary principle4. what is "best available techniques" for a particular process will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.5. if the reduction of emissions resulting from the use of best available techniques does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.b. best environmental practice1. the term "best environmental practice" means the application of the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies.2. in making a selection for individual cases, at least the following graduated range of measures should be considered:(a) the provision of information and education to the public and to users about the environmental consequences of choice of particular activities and choice of products, their use and ultimate disposal;(b) the development and application of codes of good environmental practice which cover all aspects of the activity in the product's life;(c) the mandatory application of labels informing users of environmental risks related to a product, its use and ultimate disposal;(d) saving of resources, including energy;(e) making collection and disposal systems available to the public;(f) avoiding the use of hazardous substances or products and the generation of hazardous waste;(g) recycling, recovery and re-use;(h) the application of economic instruments to activities, products or groups of products;(i) establishing a system of licensing, involving a range of restrictions or a ban.3. in determining what combination of measures constitute "best environmental practice" in general or individual cases particular consideration should be given to:(a) the environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ultimate disposal;(b) the substitution by less polluting activities or substances;(c) the scale of use;(d) the potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute materials or activities;(e) advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(f) time limits for implementation;(g) social and economic implications;(h) precautionary principle.4. it therefore follows that "best environmental practice" for a particular source will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.5. if the reduction of inputs resulting from the use of best environmental practice does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied and best environmental practice redefined.
