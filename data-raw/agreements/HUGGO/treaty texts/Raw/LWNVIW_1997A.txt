which it applies. such an agreement may be entered into with respect to an entire international watercourse or any part thereof or a particular project, programme or use except insofar as the agreement adversely affects, to a significant extent, the use by one or more other watercourse states of the waters of the watercourse, without their express consent.5. where a watercourse state
