Article 2

Financial contribution - Methods of payment

1. The financial contribution referred to in Article 7 of the Agreement shall be fixed at EUR 86 million per year [1], of which EUR 11 million per year shall be allocated by Mauritania to financial support for the implementation of the national fisheries policy, as provided for in Article 7(1)(b) of the Agreement, including EUR 1 million per year financial support for the Banc d'Arguin National Park (PNBA), for the period referred to in Article 1 of this Protocol.

5. Subject to Article 6 of this Protocol, the allocation of this contribution and of the support for the PNBA shall be decided within the framework of the Mauritanian finance act and the Mauritanian State shall have full discretion regarding the use to which it is put.

Article 3

Scientific cooperation

1. The two Parties undertake to promote responsible fishing in Mauritanian fishing zones on the basis of the principles of sustainable management.

2. During the period covered by this Protocol, the two Parties shall cooperate to develop certain issues relating to the state of resources in Mauritanian fishing zones; to this end a Joint Scientific Committee shall meet at least once a year, in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Agreement. At the request of one of the Parties and where needed within the framework of this Agreement, other meetings of this Scientific Committee may also be convened.

3. Based on the conclusions of the work of the Joint Scientific Committee and the best available scientific advice, the two Parties shall consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 10 of the Agreement and, where necessary and by mutual agreement, adopt measures to ensure the sustainable management of fisheries resources.

4. The remit of the Joint Scientific Committee shall cover in particular the following activities:

(a) drawing up an annual scientific report on the fisheries covered by this Agreement;

(b) identifying and implementing an annual programme dealing with specific scientific issues in order to improve understanding of the state of resources and changes to ecosystems;

(c) studying, under a procedure agreed by consensus within the Committee, scientific questions which arise in the course of implementing this Agreement;

(d) carrying out, among other things, and as required, exploratory fishing trips to determine the fishing opportunities and exploitation options which guarantee the conservation of resources and their ecosystem.

Article 4

Review of fishing opportunities

1. The fishing opportunities referred to in Article 1 of this Protocol may be increased by mutual agreement provided that the conclusions of the Joint Scientific Committee referred to in Article 4(1) of the Agreement confirm that such an increase will not endanger the sustainable management of Mauritania's resources. In this case the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) of this Protocol shall be increased proportionately and pro rata temporis. However, the total amount of the financial contribution paid by the European Community shall not be more than twice the amount indicated in Article 2(1) of this Protocol and shall remain proportionate to the increase in fishing opportunities.

2. Conversely, if the Parties agree to adopt measures as referred to in Article 3(3) of this Protocol resulting in a reduction in the fishing opportunities provided for in Article 1 of this Protocol, the financial contribution shall be reduced proportionately and pro rata temporis. Without prejudice to Article 6 of this Protocol, this financial contribution could be suspended by the Community if it is not possible to use the fishing opportunities provided for in this Protocol.

3. The allocation of the fishing opportunities among different categories of vessels may also be reviewed by mutual agreement between the Parties, provided that any changes comply with recommendations made by the Joint Scientific Committee regarding the management of stocks liable to be affected by such redistribution. The Parties shall agree on the corresponding adjustment of the financial contribution where the redistribution of fishing opportunities so warrants.

4. The adjustments of fishing opportunities provided for in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be decided by mutual agreement between the two Parties in the Joint Committee provided for in Article 10 of the Agreement.

Article 5

Exploratory fishing

1. The Parties may carry out exploratory fishing trips in Mauritanian fishing zones, subject to an opinion by the Joint Scientific Committee provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement. To this end, they shall hold consultations whenever one of the Parties so requests and determine, on a case-by-case basis, relevant new resources, conditions and other parameters.

2. Authorisations to carry out exploratory fishing shall be granted for test purposes for a period of no more than six months and in accordance with Article 6(2) of the Agreement. They shall be subject to the payment of a fee.

3. Where the Parties conclude that the exploratory fishing trips have produced positive results, while preserving ecosystems and conserving living marine resources, new fishing opportunities may be awarded to Community vessels following the consultation procedure provided for in Article 4 of this Protocol and until the expiry of the Protocol and in accordance with the allowable effort. The financial contribution shall be increased in accordance with Article 4.

4. Exploratory fishing shall be carried out in close collaboration with the Mauritanian Institute of Oceanographic Research and Fisheries (IMROP). IMROP shall decide the composition of the team of researchers and observers to be taken on board. Their expenses shall be borne by the shipowners. The data produced by exploratory fishing shall be the subject of a report by IMROP which shall be communicated to the Ministry.

5. Catches made during exploratory fishing shall be the property of the shipowner. Catches of species of a non-regulatory size and species which may not be fished, kept on-board or sold under Mauritanian law shall be prohibited.

6. Unless otherwise provided by mutual agreement between the two Parties, vessels operating under exploratory fishing arrangements shall land all their catches in Mauritania.

Article 6

Article 8

Economic integration of Community operators in the Mauritanian fisheries sector

1. The two Parties shall undertake to promote the economic integration of Community operators into the fisheries sector in Mauritania as a whole.

2. In order to develop the fresh products sector, by way of an incentive Mauritania shall grant Community operators landing fish in Mauritanian ports (in particular for the purposes of sales to local industries, adding value to these products in Mauritania or transporting catches made in Mauritanian fishing zones by land) a reduction in the amount of fees, in accordance with Annex I to this Protocol and with the relevant Mauritanian law.

3. The two Parties shall also decide to set up a task force to identify obstacles to direct Community investment in the fisheries sector in Mauritania, and the opportunities for such direct investment or possibilities of supporting such investment, and the measures easing the conditions governing it.

Article 9

Disputes - suspension of application of the Protocol

1. Any dispute between the Parties over the interpretation of this Protocol and its Annexes or its application shall be the subject of consultations between the Parties within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 10 of the Agreement, in a special meeting if necessary.

4. By way of derogation from the suspension procedure provided for in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the Community reserves the right to suspend application of the Protocol immediately in the event of failure by Mauritania to comply with commitments made with regard to implementation of its sectoral fisheries policy. Such suspension shall immediately be notified to the Mauritanian authorities.

5. In the event of suspension, the Parties shall continue to consult with a view to finding an amicable settlement to their dispute. Once such settlement is reached, application of the Protocol shall resume and the amount of the financial contribution shall be reduced proportionately and pro rata temporis according to the period during which application of the Protocol was suspended.
