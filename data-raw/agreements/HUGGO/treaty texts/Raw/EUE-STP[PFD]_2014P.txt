ANNEX

Conditions governing fishing activities by European Union vessels in Sao Tome and Principe's fishing zone

CHAPTER 1

APPLICATION AND ISSUE FORMALITIES FOR FISHING AUTHORISATIONS

SECTION 1

Fishing authorisations

Conditions for obtaining a fishing authorisation

1.

Only eligible vessels may obtain an authorisation (licence) to fish in Sao Tome and Principe's fishing zone.

2.

For a vessel to be eligible, neither the owner, the master nor the vessel itself must be prohibited from fishing in Sao Tome and Principe. They must be in order vis-a-vis the Sao Tomean authorities insofar as they must have fulfilled all prior obligations arising from their fishing activities in Sao Tome and Principe under fisheries agreements concluded with the European Union. Furthermore, they must comply with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 (1) on fishing authorisations.

3.

Any European Union vessel applying for a fishing authorisation must be represented by an agent resident in Sao Tome and Principe. The name and address of that agent may be stated in the fishing authorisation application.

Application for a fishing authorisation

4.

The relevant European Union authorities shall submit,(by electronic means, to the Ministry responsible for fisheries in Sao Tome and Principe, with a copy to the European Union Delegation to Gabon, an application for each vessel wishing to fish under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement at least fifteen (15) working days before the date of commencement of the period of validity requested. The originals are to be sent directly by the relevant European Union authorities in Sao Tome and Principe with a copy to the European Union Delegation to Gabon.

5.

Applications shall be submitted to the Ministry responsible for fisheries on a form drawn up in accordance with the specimen in Appendix 1.

6.

All fishing authorisation applications shall be accompanied by the following documents:

-

proof of payment of the flat-rate advance for the period of validity of the authorisation;

-

a recent colour photograph of the vessel, showing a lateral view.

7.

The fee shall be paid into the account specified by the the authorities of Sao Tome and Principe in accordance with Article 2(8) of the Protocol.

8.

The fees shall include all national and local charges, with the exception of port taxes and service charges.

Issue of fishing licences

9.

Fishing authorisations for all vessels shall be issued to vessel owners or their agents via the European Union Delegation to Gabon within 15 working days of receipt of all the documents referred to in point 6 by the Ministry responsible for fisheries in Sao Tome and Principe. At the same time, in order to not delay the possibility of fishing in the area, a copy of the fishing authorisation will be sent to the vessel owners electronically. This copy may be used for a maximum period of 60 days after the date on which the licence was issued. During this period, the copy shall be considered equivalent to the original.

10.

Fishing authorisations shall be issued for a given vessel and shall not be transferable.

11.

However, at the request of the European Union and where force majeure is proven, a vessel's fishing authorisation shall be replaced by a new fishing authorisation for another vessel of the same category as the first vessel, with no further fee due. In this case, the calculation of the catch levels to determine whether an additional payment should be made shall take account of the sum of the total catches of the two vessels.

12.

The owner of the first vessel, or his agent, shall return the cancelled fishing authorisation to the Ministry responsible for fisheries in Sao Tome and Principe via the European Union Delegation to Gabon.

13.

The new fishing authorisation shall take effect on the day on which the cancelled fishing authorisation is returned to the Ministry responsible for fisheries in Sao Tome and Principe. The European Union Delegation to Gabon shall be informed of the transfer of the fishing authorisation.

14.

The fishing authorisation must be held on board at all times, without prejudice to the provisions of point 9 of this Section.

SECTION 2

4.

Any transhipment or landing of catches not covered by the above provisions shall be prohibited in Sao Tomean waters. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the penalties provided for by Sao Tomean law.

SECTION 4

Satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS)

1.   Vessel position messages-VMS system

Whilst they are in the Sao Tomean zone, EU vessels holding a licence must be equipped with a satellite monitoring system (Vessel Monitoring System - VMS) to enable automatic and continuous communication of their position, at all times, to the fishing control centre (Fisheries Monitoring Centre-FMC) of their flag State.

Each position message must contain:

(a)

the vessel identification,

(b)

the most recent geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a position error of less than 100 metres, and with a confidence interval of 99 %;

(c)

the date and time the position is recorded;

(d)

the speed and the course of the vessel.

Each position message must be configured in accordance with the format set out in Appendix 4 to this Annex.

The first position recorded after entry into the Sao Tomean zone shall be identified by the code 'ENT'. All subsequent positions shall be identified by the code 'POS', with the exception of the first position recorded after departure from the Sao Tomean zone, which shall be identified by the code 'EXI'.

The FMC of the flag State shall ensure the automatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the position messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner and kept for a period of three years.

2.   Transmission by the vessel in the event of breakdown of the VMS

The master shall ensure at all times that the VMS of his vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are correctly transmitted to the FMC of the flag State.

In the event of breakdown, the VMS of the vessel shall be repaired or replaced within 10 days. After that period, the vessel shall no longer be authorised to fish in the Sao Tomean fishing zone.

Vessels fishing in the Sao Tomean zone with a defective VMS must communicate their position messages by e-mail, radio or fax to the FMC of the flag State, at least every four hours, and must provide all the compulsory information.

3.   Secure communication of position messages to Sao Tome and Principe

The FMC of the flag state shall automatically send the position messages of the vessels concerned to the FMC of Sao Tome and Principe. The FMC of the flag State and Sao Tome and Principe shall exchange their contact e-mail addresses and inform each other without delay of any change to these addresses.

The transmission of position messages between the FMCs of the flag State and Sao Tome and Principe shall be carried out electronically using a secure communication system.

The FMC of Sao Tome and Principe shall inform without delay the FMC of the flag State and the European Union of any interruption in the reception of consecutive position messages from a vessel holding a licence, where the vessel concerned has not notified its exit from the zone.

4.   Malfunction of the communication system

Sao Tome and Principe shall ensure the compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag State and inform the European Union immediately of any malfunction as regards the sending and receiving of position messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as possible.

The master shall be considered responsible for any proven tampering with a vessel's VMS aimed at disturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringements shall be subject to the penalties provided for by current Sao Tomean legislation.

5.   Revision of the frequency of position messages

On the basis of documentary evidence proving an infringement, Sao Tome and Principe may ask the FMC of the flag State, copying in the EU, to reduce the interval for sending position messages from a vessel to every thirty minutes for a set period of investigation. This documentary evidence must be sent without delay by Sao Tome and Principe to the FMC of the flag State and the EU. The FMC of the flag state shall immediately send the position messages to Sao Tome and Principe at the new frequency.

When the period of investigation ends, Sao Tome and Principe shall immediately inform the FMC of the flag State and the EU. and subsequently inform them of any follow-up.

Should a vessel with an observer on board leave Sao Tome and Principe's fishing zone, all measures must be taken to ensure the observer's return to Sao Tome and Principe as soon as possible at the expense of the vessel owner.

7.

If the observer is not present at the time and place agreed or within 12 hours of the time agreed, the vessel owner shall be automatically absolved of his obligation to take the observer on board.

8.

The observer shall be treated on board as an officer. When the vessel is operating in Sao Tomean waters, he shall carry out the following tasks:

8.1.

observe the fishing activities of the vessels;

8.2.

verify the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations;

8.3.

note the fishing gear used;

8.4.

verify the catch data for Sao Tomean waters recorded in the logbook;

8.5.

verify the percentages of by-catches and estimate the quantity of discards of species of marketable fish;

8.6.

report fishing data, including the quantity of catches and by-catches on board, to his competent authority by any appropriate means.

9.

The master shall do everything in his power to ensure the physical safety and welfare of the observer during the performance of his duties.

10.

The observer shall be offered every facility needed to carry out his duties. The master shall give him access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of his duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel's fishing activities, including in particular the logbook and the navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the exercise of his tasks.

11.

While on board, the observer shall:

11.1.

take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of his boarding and presence on board the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations;

11.2.

respect the material and equipment on board and the confidentiality of all documents belonging to the vessel.

12.

At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel, the observer shall draw up an activity report to be transmitted to the competent Sao Tomean authorities, with a copy to the European Commission. He shall sign it in the presence of the master, who may add or cause to be added to it any observations considered relevant, followed by the master's signature. A copy of the report shall be handed to the master when the observer is put ashore.

13.

The vessel owner shall bear the cost of providing board and accommodation for the observer in the same conditions as for officers, within the confines of the practical possibilities offered by the vessel.

14.

The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by Sao Tome and Principe.

CHAPTER VI

CONTROL AND INSPECTION

1.

European fishing vessels shall comply with the measures and recommendations adopted by ICCAT with regard to fishing gear and the related technical specifications and all other technical measures applicable to their fishing activities.

2.

Inspection procedures:

 

Inspections at sea, in or off port within the Sao Tomean fishing zone on European Union vessels having been granted a licence shall be carried out by vessels and inspectors from Sao Tome and Principe, clearly identifiable as assigned to the control of fisheries.

 

Before boarding, the Sao Tomean inspectors shall inform the European Union vessel of their decision to carry out an inspection. The inspection shall be carried out by a maximum of two inspectors, who must provide proof of their identity and official position as an inspector before carrying out the inspection.

 

The Sao Tomean inspectors shall only stay on board the European Union vessel for the time necessary to carry out tasks linked to the inspection. They shall carry out the inspection in a way which minimises the impact on the vessel, its fishing activity and cargo.

 

Sao Tome and Principe may authorise the European Union to participate in the inspection at sea as an observer.

 

The master of the European Union vessel shall facilitate the boarding of the Sao Tomean inspectors and their work on board.

 

At the end of each inspection, the Sao Tomean inspectors shall draw up an inspection report. The master of the European Union vessel has the right to include his comments in the inspection report. The inspection report shall be signed by the inspector drawing up the report and the master of the European Union vessel.

 

The signature of the inspection report by the master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner's right of defence in respect of an infringement. If the master refuses to sign this document, he shall specify his reasons in writing and the inspector shall write 'refusal to sign' on it. The Sao Tomean inspectors shall issue a copy of the inspection report to the master of the European Union vessel before leaving the vessel. Sao Tome and Principe shall send a copy of the inspection report to the European Union within a period of seven working days after the inspection.

CHAPTER VII

INFRINGEMENTS

1.

Handling of infringements:

Any infringement committed by an EU vessel holding a licence in accordance with the provisions of this Annex must be referred to in an inspection report. That report shall be sent to the European Union and to the flag State within 24 hours. The signature of the inspection report by the master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner's right of defence in respect of an infringement procedure. The master of the vessel shall cooperate while the inspection procedure is being carried out.

2.

Detention of a vessel - Information meeting:

 

Where permitted under current Sao Tomean legislation regarding the infringement, any EU vessel having committed an infringement may be forced to cease its fishing activity and, where the vessel is at sea, to return to a Sao Tomean port.

 

Sao Tome and Principe shall notify the European Union within 24 hours of any detention of a European Union vessel holding a licence. That notification shall be accompanied by documentary evidence of the infringement.

 

Before taking any measure against the vessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed at protecting evidence, Sao Tome and Principe shall organise, at the request of the European Union, within one working day of notification of the detention of the vessel, an information meeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel being detained and to explain what further action may be taken. A representative of the flag State of the vessel may attend this information meeting.

3.

Penalties for infringements - Compromise procedure:

 

The penalty for the infringement shall be set by Sao Tome and Principe according to the provisions of current national legislation.

 

Where settling the infringement involves legal proceedings, before these are launched, and provided that the infringement does not involve a criminal act, a compromise procedure shall be undertaken between Sao Tome and Principe and the European Union in order to determine the terms and level of the penalty. A representative of the flag State of the vessel and of the European Union may participate in that compromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall finish at the latest three days after notification of the vessel's detention.

4.

Legal proceedings - Bank security

 

If the compromise procedure fails and the infringement is brought before the competent court, the owner of the vessel which committed the infringement shall deposit a bank security at a bank designated by Sao Tome and Principe, the amount of which, as set by Sao Tome and Principe, shall cover the costs linked to the detention of the vessel, the estimated fine and any compensation. The bank security may not be recovered until the legal proceedings have been concluded.

 

The bank security shall be released and returned to the vessel owner without delay after the judgment has been delivered:

(a)

in full, if no penalty has been imposed;

(b)

for the amount of the remaining balance, if the penalty is a fine which is lower than the amount of the bank security.

 

Sao Tome and Principe shall inform the European Union of the outcome of the legal proceedings within seven days of the judgment being delivered.

5.

Release of the vessel and the crew:

The vessel and its crew shall be authorised to leave the port once the penalty has been paid in a compromise procedure, or once the bank security has been deposited.

Appendix 5

GUIDELINES FOR MANAGING AND IMPLEMENTING THE ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM FOR FISHING ACTIVITIES (ERS)

General provisions

(1)

All EU fishing vessels must be equipped with an electronic system, hereinafter referred to as 'ERS system', capable of recording and transmitting data relating to the vessel's fishing activity, hereinafter referred to as 'ERS data', whenever the vessel is operating in the waters of Sao Tome and Principe.

(2)

An EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS, or whose ERS is not working, is not authorised to enter Sao Tomean waters in order to engage in fishing activities.

(3)

ERS data shall be transmitted in accordance with the procedures of the vessel's flag State, i.e. they shall firstly be sent to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter: FMC) of the flag State which will make them automatically available to the Sao Tomean FMC.

(4)

The flag State and Sao Tome and Principe shall ensure that their FMCs have the necessary IT equipment and software to automatically transmit ERS data in xml format, [available via http://ec.europa.eu/cfp/control/codes/index_en.htm] and shall have a backup procedure in place capable of saving and storing ERS data in a format which will be computer-readable for at least three years.

(5)

Any change or update to this format shall be identified and dated and must be operational six (6) months after its introduction.

(6)

ERS data must be transmitted using the electronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf of the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).

(7)

The flag State and Sao Tome and Principe shall each designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact.

(a)

ERS correspondents shall be designated for a minimum period of six (6) months.

(b)

The FMCs of the flag State and Sao Tome and Principe shall notify one another of the contact details (name, address, telephone number, fax, e-mail address) of their ERS correspondent, before the supplier starts production of the ERS.

(c)

Any changes to the contact details of the ERS correspondent must be notified immediately.

Producing and communicating ERS data

(8)

EU fishing vessels must:

(a)

communicate on a daily basis ERS data for each day spent in Sao Tomean waters;

(b)

record the quantity of each species caught and kept on board as target species or by-catch, or discarded, for each fishing operation;

(c)

declare the bad catch of each species specified in the fishing authorisation issued by Sao Tome and Principe;

(d)

identify each species by its FAO 3-alpha code;

(e)

express quantities in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish;

(f)

record, in the ERS data, the transhipped and/or unloaded quantity of each species;

(g)

record in the ERS data, every time Sao Tomean waters are entered (COE message) or exited (COX message), a specific message containing the quantities held on board at the time of passing for each species specified in the fishing authorisation issued by Sao Tome and Principe;

(h)

transmit ERS data on a daily basis to the FMC of the flag State, according to the format referred to in paragraph 3 above, by 23:59 UTC at the latest.

(9)

The master is responsible for the accuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent.

(10)

The FMC of the flag State shall send the ERS data automatically and without delay to the Sao Tomean FMC.

(11)

The FMC of Sao Tome and Principe shall confirm that it has received the ERS data by means of a return message and shall handle all ERS data confidentially.

Failure of the on-board ERS and/or transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State

(12)

The flag State shall immediately inform the master and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or their agent, of any technical failure of the ERS installed on board or any breakdown in transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State.

(13)

The flag State shall inform Sao Tome and Principe of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken.

(14)

In the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS, the master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within 10 days. If the vessel makes a call at a port within those 10 days, it may only resume fishing activity in Sao Tomean waters once its ERS is in perfect working order, unless Sao Tomean authorities allow otherwise.

(15)

Following a technical failure in its ERS, a fishing vessel may not leave port until:

(a)

its ERS is in working order again, to the satisfaction of the flag State and Sao Tome and Principe, or

(b)

it receives authorisation from the flag State. In the latter case, the flag State shall inform Sao Tome and Principe of its decision before the vessel leaves.

(16)

Any EU vessel operating in Sao Tomean waters with a faulty ERS must transmit all ERS data on a daily basis and by 23:59 UTC at the latest to the FMC of the flag State by any other available means of electronic communication accessible by the Sao Tomean FMC.

(17)

ERS data which could not be made available to Sao Tome and Principe via the ERS owing to a failure shall be transmitted by the FMC of the flag State to the FMC of Sao Tome and Principe by another mutually agreed form of electronic communication. This alternative transmission shall be considered a priority, it being understood that it will not be possible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.

(18)

If the FMC of Sao Tome and Principe does not receive ERS data from a vessel for three consecutive days, Sao Tome and Principe may instruct the vessel to immediately call at a port of Sao Tome and Principe's choosing in order to investigate.

FMC failure - ERS data not received by Sao Tomean FMC

(19)

In the event that ERS data are not received by an FMC, its ERS correspondent shall immediately inform the ERS correspondent for the other FMC, and if necessary they shall work together to resolve the problem.

(20)

Before the ERS becomes operational, the FMC of the flag State and the Sao Tomean FMC shall mutually agree on the alternative means of electronic communication to be used in order to transmit ERS data in the event of an FMC failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any changes.

(21)

If the Sao Tomean FMC reports that ERS data have not been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the problem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve the problem. The FMC of the flag State shall inform the Sao Tomean FMC and the EU of the outcome of the measures taken within 24 hours of recognising the failure.

(22)

If more than 24 hours is required in order to resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag State shall immediately transmit the missing ERS data to the Sao Tomean FMC via one of the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 17.

(23)

Sao Tome and Principe shall inform its competent monitoring services (MCS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the Sao Tomean FMC to be in breach of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data, owing to a failure in one of the FMCs.

FMC maintenance

(24)

Planned maintenance of an FMC (maintenance programme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least 72 hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating, where possible, the date and duration of the maintenance work. Information about unplanned maintenance work shall be sent to the other FMC as soon as possible.

(25)

During the maintenance work, the provision of ERS data may be put on hold until the system is operational again. The relevant ERS data shall be made available immediately after the maintenance work has been completed.

(26)

If the maintenance work takes more than 24 hours, ERS data shall be sent to the other FMC using one of the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 17.

(27)

Sao Tome and Principe shall inform its competent monitoring services (MCS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the Sao Tomean FMC to be in breach of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data, owing to the maintenance of an FMC.
