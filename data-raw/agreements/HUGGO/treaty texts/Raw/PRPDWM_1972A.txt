convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other mattersrc: the contracting parties to this convention,recognizing that the marine environment and the living organisms which it supports are of vital importance to humanity, and all people have an interest in assuring that it is so managed that its quality and resources are not impaired;recognizing that the capacity of the sea to assimilate wastes and render them harmless, and its ability to regenerate natural resources, is not unlimited;recognizing that states have, in accordance with the charter of the united nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction;recalling resolution 2749(xxv) of the general assembly of the united nations on the principles governing the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction;noting that marine pollution originates in many sources, such as dumping and discharges through the atmosphere, rivers, estuaries, outfalls and pipelines, and that it is important that states use the best practicable means to prevent such pollution and develop products and processes which will reduce the amount of harmful wastes to be disposed of;being convinced that international action to control the pollution of the sea by dumping can and must be taken without delay but that this action should not preclude discussion of measures to control other sources of marine pollution as soon as possible; andwishing to improve protection of the marine environment by encouraging states with a common interest in particular geographical areas to enter into appropriate agreements supplementary to this convention;have agreed as follows: ARTICLE icontracting parties shall individually and collectively promote the effective control of all sources of pollution of the marine environment, and pledge themselves especially to take all practicable steps to prevent the pollution of the sea by the dumping of waste and other matter that is liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea ARTICLE iicontracting parties shall, as provided for in the following articles, take effective measures individually, according to their scientific, technical and economic capabilities, and collectively, to prevent marine pollution caused by dumping and shall harmonize their policies in this regard ARTICLE iiifor the purposes of this convention:1 (a) "dumping" means:(i) any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;(ii) any deliberate disposal at sea of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea.(b) "dumping" does not include:(i) the disposal at sea of wastes or other matter incidental to, or derived from the normal operations of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea and their equipment, other than wastes or other matter transported by or to vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, operating for the purpose of disposal of such matter or derived from the treatment of such wastes or other matter on such vessels, aircraft, platforms or structures;(ii) placement of matter for a purpose other than the mere disposal thereof, provided that such placement is not contrary to the aims of this convention.(c) the disposal of wastes or other matter directly arising from, or related to the exploration, exploitation and associated off-shore processing of sea-bed mineral resources will not be covered by the provisions of this convention.2 "vessels and aircraft" means waterborne or airborne craft of any type whatsoever. this expression includes air cushioned craft and floating craft, whether self-propelled or not.3 "sea" means all marine waters other than the internal waters of states.4 "wastes or other matter" means material and substance of any kind, form or description.5 "special permit" means permission granted specifically on application in advance and in accordance with annex ii and annex iii.6 "general permit" means permission granted in advance and in accordance with annex iii.7 "the organization" means the organization designated by the contracting parties in accordance with article xiv(2) ARTICLE iv1 in accordance with the provisions of this convention contracting parties shall prohibit the dumping of any wastes or other matter in whatever form or condition except as otherwise specified below:(a) the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in annex i is prohibited;(b) the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in annex ii requires a prior special permit;(c) the dumping of all other wastes or matter requires a prior general permit.2 any permit shall be issued only after careful consideration of all the factors set forth in annex iii, including prior studies of the characteristics of the dumping site, as set forth in sections b and c of that annex.3 no provision of this convention is to be interpreted as preventing a contracting party from prohibiting, insofar as that party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter not mentioned in annex i. that party shall notify such measures to the organization ARTICLE v1 the provisions of article iv shall not apply when it is necessary to secure the safety of human life or of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in cases of force majeure caused by stress of weather, or in any case which constitutes a danger to human life or a real threat to vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea, if dumping appears to be the only way of averting the threat and if there is every probability that the damage consequent upon such dumping will be less than would otherwise occur. such dumping shall be so conducted as to minimize the likelihood of damage to human or marine life and shall be reported forthwith to the organization.2 a contracting party may issue a special permit as an exception to article iv(1)(a), in emergencies, posing unacceptable risk relating to human health and admitting no other feasible solution. before doing so the party shall consult any other country or countries that are likely to be affected and the organization which, after consulting other parties, and international organizations as appropriate, shall, in accordance with article xiv promptly recommend to the party the most appropriate procedures to adopt. the party shall follow these recommendations to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the time within which action must be taken and with the general obligation to avoid damage to the marine environment and shall inform the organization of the action it takes. the parties pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations.3 any contracting party may waive its rights under paragraph (2) at the time of, or subsequent to ratification of, or accession to this convention ARTICLE vi1 each contracting party shall

adopted by the contracting parties in consultation, to the extent specified in these regulations and guidelines.d materials which, though of a nontoxic nature, may become harmful due to the quantities in which they are dumped, or which are liable to seriously reduce amenities ANNEX iiiprovisions to be considered in establishing criteria governing the issue of permits for the dumping of matter at sea, taking into account article iv(2), include:a characteristics and composition of the matter1 total amount and average composition of matter dumped (e.g. per year).2 form, e.g. solid, sludge, liquid, or gaseous.3 properties: physical (e.g. solubility and density), chemical and biochemical (e.g. oxygen demand, nutrients) and biological (e.g. presence of viruses, bacteria, yeasts, parasites).4 toxicity.5 persistence: physical, chemical and biological.6 accumulation and biotransformation in biological materials or sediments.7 susceptibility to physical, chemical and biochemical changes and interaction in the aquatic environment with other dissolved organic and inorganic materials.8 probability of production of taints or other changes reducing marketability of resources (fish, shellfish, etc.).9 in issuing a permit for dumping, contracting parties should consider whether an adequate scientific basis exists concerning characteristics and composition of the matter to be dumped to assess the impact of the matter on marine life and on human health.b characteristics of dumping site and method of deposit1 location (e.g. coordinates of the dumping area, depth and distance from the coast), location in relation to other areas (e.g. amenity areas, spawning, nursery and fishing areas and exploitable resources).2 rate of disposal per specific period (e.g. quantity per day, per week, per month).3 methods of packaging and containment, if any.4 initial dilution achieved by proposed method of release.5 dispersal characteristics (e.g. effects of currents, tides and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing).6 water characteristics (e.g. temperature, ph, salinity, stratification, oxygen indices of pollutiondissolved oxygen (do), chemical oxygen demand (cod), biochemical oxygen demand (bod) nitrogen present in organic and mineral form including ammonia, suspended matter, other nutrients and productivity).7 bottom characteristics (e.g. topography, geochemical and geological characteristics and biological productivity).8 existence and effects of other dumpings which have been made in the dumping area (e.g. heavy metal background reading and organic carbon content).9 in issuing a permit for dumping, contracting parties should consider whether an adequate scientific basis exists for assessing the consequences of such dumping, as outlined in this annex, taking into account seasonal variations.c general considerations and conditions1 possible effects on amenities (e.g. presence of floating or stranded material, turbidity, objectionable odour, discolouration and foaming).2 possible effects on marine life, fish and shellfish culture, fish stocks and fisheries, seaweed harvesting and culture.3 possible effects on other uses of the sea (e.g. impairment of water quality for industrial use, underwater corrosion of structures, interference with ship operations from floating materials, interference with fishing or navigation through deposit of waste or solid objects on the sea floor and protection of areas of special importance for scientific or conservation purposes).4 the practical availability of alternative landbased methods of treatment, disposal or elimination, or of treatment to render the matter less harmful for dumping at sea.[1] signatures omitted.[2] regulations for the control of incineration of wastes and other matter at sea, as adopted in 1978, have not been reproduced in this document.
