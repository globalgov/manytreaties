agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seassource: preamblethe parties to this agreement,recognizing that all states have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas, subject to the relevant rules of international law, as reflected in the united nations convention on the law of the sea,further recognizing that, under international law as reflected in the united nations convention on the law of the sea, all states have the duty to take, or to cooperate with other states in taking, such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas,acknowledging the right and interest of all states to develop their fishing sectors in accordance with their national policies, and the need to promote cooperation with developing countries to enhance their capabilities to fulfill their obligations under this agreement,recalling that agenda 21, adopted by the united nations conference on environment and development, calls upon states to take effective action, consistent with international law, to deter reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas,further recalling that the declaration of cancun, adopted by the international conference on responsible fishing, also calls on states to take action in this respect,bearing in mind that under agenda 21, states commit themselves to the conservation and sustainable use of marine living resources on the high seas,calling upon states which do not participate in global, regional or subregional fisheries organizations or arrangements to join or, as appropriate, to enter into understandings with such organizations or with parties to such organizations or arrangements with a view to achieving compliance with international conservation and management measures,conscious of the duties of every state to exercise effectively its jurisdiction and control over vessels flying its flag, including fishing vessels and vessels engaged in the transshipment of fish,mindful that the practice of flagging or reflagging fishing vessels as a means of avoiding compliance with international conservation and management measures for living marine resources, and the failure of flag states to fulfill their responsibilities with respect to fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag, are among the factors that seriously undermine the effectiveness of such measures,realizing that the objective of this agreement can be achieved through specifying flag states' responsibility in respect of fishing vessels entitled to fly their flags and operating on the high seas, including the authorization by the flag state of such operations, as well as through strengthened international cooperation and increased transparency through the exchange of information on high seas fishing,noting that this agreement will form an integral part of the international code of conduct for responsible fishing called for in the declaration of cancun,desiring to conclude an international agreement within the framework of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, hereinafter referred to as fao, under article xiv of the fao constitution,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE idefinitionsfor the purposes of this agreement:(a) "fishing vessel" means any vessel used or intended for use for the purposes of the commercial exploitation of living marine resources, including mother ships and any other vessels directly engaged in such fishing operations;(b) "international conservation and management measures" means measures to conserve or manage one or more species of living marine resources that are adopted and applied in accordance with the relevant rules of international law as reflected in the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea. such measures may be adopted either by global, regional or subregional fisheries organizations, subject to the rights and obligations of their members, or by treaties or other international agreements;(c) "length" means(i) for any fishing vessel built after 18 july 1982, 96 percent of the total length on a waterline at 85 percent of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel, or the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline, if that be greater. in ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this length is measured shall be parallel to the designed waterline;(ii) for any fishing vessel built before 18 july 1982, registered length as entered on the national register or other record of vessels;(d) "record of fishing vessels" means a record of fishing vessels in which are recorded pertinent details of the fishing vessel. it may constitute a separate record for fishing vessels or form part of a general record of vessels;(e) "regional economic integration organization" means a regional economic integration organization to which its member states have transferred competence over matters covered by this agreement, including the authority to make decisions binding on its member states in respect of those matters;(f) "vessels entitled to fly its flag" and "vessels entitled to fly the flag of a state", includes vessels entitled to fly the flag of a member state of a regional economic integration organization ARTICLE iiapplication1. subject to the following paragraphs of this article, this agreement shall apply to all fishing vessels that are used or intended for fishing on the high seas.2. a party may exempt fishing vessels of less than 24 metres in length entitled to fly its flag from the application of this agreement unless the party determines that such an exemption would undermine the object and purpose of this agreement, provided that such exemptions:(a) shall not be granted in respect of fishing vessels operating in fishing regions referred to in paragraph 3 below, other than fishing vessels that are entitled to fly the flag of a coastal state of that fishing region; and(b) shall not apply to the obligations undertaken by a party under paragraph 1 of article iii, or paragraph 7 of article vi of this agreement.3. without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2 above, in any fishing region where bordering coastal states have not yet declared exclusive economic zones, or equivalent zones of national jurisdiction over fisheries, such coastal states as are parties to this agreement may agree, either directly or through appropriate regional fisheries organizations, to establish a minimum length of fishing vessels below which this agreement shall not apply in respect of fishing vessels flying the flag of any such coastal state and operating exclusively in such fishing region ARTICLE iiiflag state

(a) no party shall authorize any fishing vessel previously registered in the territory of another party that has undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures to be used for fishing on the high seas, unless it is satisfied that(i) any period of suspension by another party of an authorization for such fishing vessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has expired; and(ii) no authorization for such fishing vessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has been withdrawn by another party within the last three years.(b) the provisions of subparagraph (a)

used for fishing on the high seas, where the party concerned, after having taken into account all relevant facts, including the circumstances in which the fishing authorization has been withdrawn by the other party or state, has determined that to grant an authorization to use the vessel for fishing on the high seas would not undermine the object and purpose of this agreement.6. each party shall ensure that all fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag that it has entered in the record maintained under article iv are marked in such a way that they can be readily identified in accordance with generally accepted standards, such as the fao standard specifications for the marking and identification of fishing vessels.7. each party shall ensure that each fishing vessel entitled to fly its flag
