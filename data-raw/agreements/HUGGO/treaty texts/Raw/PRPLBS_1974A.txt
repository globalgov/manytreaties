convention for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sourcessource: the contracting parties:recognizing that the marine environment and the fauna and flora which it supports are of vital importance to all nations;mindful that the ecological equilibrium and the legitimate uses of the sea are increasingly threatened by pollution;considering the recommendations of the united nations conference on the human environment, held in stockholm in june 1972;recognizing that concerted action at national, regional and global levels is essential to prevent and combat marine pollution;convinced that international action to control the pollution of the sea from land-based sources can and should be taken without delay, as part of progressive and coherent measures to protect the marine environment from pollution, whatever its origin, including current efforts to combat the pollution of international waterways;considering that the common interests of states concerned with the same marine area should induce them to cooperate at regional or sub-regional levels;recalling the convention for the prevention of marine pollution by dumping from ships and aircraft concluded in 0510 on february 15, 1972,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 11. the contracting parties pledge themselves to take all possible steps to prevent pollution of the sea, by which is meant the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the marine environment (including estuaries) resulting in such deleterious effects as hazards to human health, harm to living resources and to marine ecosystems, damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate uses of the sea.2. the contracting parties shall adopt individually and jointly measures to combat marine pollution from land-based sources in accordance with the provisions of the present convention and shall harmonize their policies in this regard ARTICLE 2the present convention shall apply to the maritime area within the following limits: (a) those parts of the atlantic and arctic oceans and the dependent seas which lie north of 36 deg. north latitude and between 42 deg. west longitude and 51 deg. east longitude, but excluding:(i) the baltic sea and belts lying to the south and east of lines drawn from hasenore head to gniben point, from korshage to spodsbjerg and from gilbjerg head to kullen and(ii) the mediterranean sea and its dependent seas as far as the point of intersection of the parallel of 36 deg. north latitude and the meridian of 5 deg. 36' west longitude; (b) that part of the atlantic ocean north of 59 deg. north latitude and between 44 deg. west longitude and 42 deg. west longitude ARTICLE 3for the purpose of the present convention: (a) 'maritime area' means: the high seas, the territorial seas of contracting parties and waters on the landward side of the base lines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured and extending in the case of watercourses, unless otherwise decided under article 16(c) of the present convention, up to the freshwater limit; (b) 'freshwater limit' means: the place in the watercourse where, at low tide and in a period of low freshwater flow, there is an appreciable increase in salinity due to the presence of seawater; (c) 'pollution from land-based sources' means: the pollution of the maritime area (i) through watercourses, (ii) from the coast, including introduction through underwater or other pipelines, (iii) from man-made structures placed under the jurisdiction of a contracting party within the limits of the area to which the present convention applies. (iv) by emissions into the atmosphere from land or from man-made structures as defined in subparagraph (iii) above ARTICLE 41. the contracting parties undertake: (a) to eliminate, if necessary by stages, pollution of the maritime area from land-based sources by substances listed in part i of annex a to the present convention; (b) to limit strictly pollution of the maritime area from land-based

appropriate, implement programmes or measures to forestall, reduce or eliminate pollution of the maritime area from land-based sources by a substance not then listed in annex a to the present convention, if scientific evidence has established that a serious hazard may be created in the maritime area by that substance and if urgent action is necessary ARTICLE 51. the contracting parties undertake to adopt measures to forestall and, as appropriate, eliminate pollution of the maritime area from land-based sources by radioactive substances referred to in part iii of annex a to the

convention.done at paris, june 4, 1974 ANNEX athe allocation of substances to parts i, ii and iii below takes account of the following criteria: (a) persistence; (b) toxicity or other noxious properties; (c) tendency to bio-accumulation.these criteria are not necessarily of equal importance for a particular substance or group of substances, and other factors, such as the location and quantities of the discharge, may need to be considered.part ithe following substances are included in this part: (i) because they are not readily degradable or rendered harmless by natural processes; and (ii)because they may either: (a) give rise to dangerous accumulation of harmful material in the food chain, or (b) endanger the welfare of living organisms causing undesirable changes in the marine eco-systems, or (c) interfere seriously with the harvesting of sea foods or with other legitimate uses of the sea; and (iii)because it is considered that pollution by these substances necessitates urgent action: 1. organohalogen compounds and substances which may form such compounds in the marine environment, excluding those which are biologically harmless, or which are rapidly converted in the sea into substances which are biologically harmless; 2. mercury and mercury compounds; 3. cadmium and cadmium compounds; 4. persistent synthetic materials which may float, remain in suspension or sink, and which may seriously interfere with any legitimate use of the sea; 5. persistent oils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin.part iithe following substances are included in this part because, although exhibiting similar characteristics to the substances in part i and requiring strict control, they seem less noxious or are more readily rendered harmless by natural processes:1. organic compounds of phosphorus, silicon, and tin and substances which may form such compounds in the marine environment, excluding those which are biologically harmless, or which are rapidly converted in the sea into substances which are biologically harmless. 2. elemental phosphorus. 3. non-persistent oils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin. 4. the following elements and their compounds. - arsenic, - chromium, - copper, - lead, - nickel, - zinc. 5. substances which have been agreed by the commission as having a deleterious effect on the taste and/or smell of products derived from the marine environment for human consumption.part iiithe following substances are included in this part because, although they display characteristics similar to those of substances listed in part i and should be subject to stringent controls with the aim of preventing and, as appropriate, eliminating the pollution which they cause, they are already the subject of research, recommendations and, in some cases, measures under the auspices of several international organizations and institutions; those substances are subject to the provisions of article- radioactive substances, including wastes ANNEX b ARTICLE 1unless the parties to the dispute decide otherwise, the arbitration procedure shall be in accordance with the provisions of this annex ARTICLE 21. at the

the united nations who shall make this appointment within a further two months' period ARTICLE 51. the arbitral tribunal shall decide according to the rules of international law and, in particular, those of this convention.2. any arbitral tribunal constituted under the provisions of this annex shall draw up its own rules of procedure ARTICLE 61. the decisions of the arbitral tribunal, both on procedure and on substance, shall be taken by majority voting of its members.2. the tribunal may take all appropriate measures in order to establish the facts. it may, at the request of one of the
