protocol to the 1979 convention on long-range transboundary air pollution on the reduction of sulphur emissions or their transboundary fluxes by at least 30 per centsource: the parties,determined to implement the convention on long-range transboundary air pollution,concerned that the present emissions of air pollutants are causing widespread damage, in exposed parts of europe and north america, to natural resources of vital environmental and economic importance, such as forests, soils and waters, and to materials (including historical monuments) and, under certain circumstances, have harmful effects on human health,aware of the fact that the predominant sources of air pollution contributing to the acidification of the environment are the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production, and the main technological processes in various industrial sectors, as well as transport, which lead to emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and other pollutants,considering that high priority should be given to reducing sulphur emissions, which will have positive results environmentally, on the overall economic situation and on human health,recalling the decision of the united nations economic commission for europe (ece) at its thirty-ninth session, which stresses the urgency of intensifying efforts to arrive at coordinated national strategies and policies in the ece region to reduce sulphur emissions effectively at national levels,recalling the recognition by the executive body for the convention at its first session of the need to decrease effectively the total annual emissions of sulphur compounds or their transboundary fluxes by 1993-1995, using 1980 levels as the basis for calculations of reductions,recalling that the multilateral conference on the causes and prevention of damage to forests and water by air pollution in europe (munich, 24-27 june 1984) had requested that the executive body for the convention, as a matter of highest priority, adopt a proposal for a specific agreement on the reduction of annual national sulphur emissions or their transboundary fluxes by 1993 at the latest,noting that a number of contracting parties to the convention have decided to implement reductions of their national annual sulphur emissions or their transboundary fluxes by at least 30 per cent as soon as possible and at the latest by 1993, using 1980 levels as the basis for calculation of reductions,recognizing, on the other hand, that some contracting parties to the convention, while not signing the present protocol at the time of its opening for signature, will nevertheless contribute significantly to the reduction of transboundary air pollution, or will continue to make efforts to control sulphur emissions, as stated in the document annexed to the report of the executive body at its third session,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of the present protocol,1. "convention'' means the convention on long-range transboundary air pollution, adopted in geneva on 13 november 1979;2.
