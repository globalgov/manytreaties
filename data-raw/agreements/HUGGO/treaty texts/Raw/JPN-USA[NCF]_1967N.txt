AGREED MINUTES
The representatives of the Government of the United States of America
and the Government of Japan have agreed to record the following in con
nection with the notes exchanged today between Foreign Minister Miki
and Ambassador Johnson concerning certain fisheries off the coast of the
United States of America, the notes exchanged today between Foreign
Minister Mild and Ambassador Johnson concerning the salmon fishery
and the note of Foreign Minister Miki of today's date concerning dragnet
and longline fishing in certain waters :
1. It is agreed that for the purposes of the arrangements set forth
in the above-mentioned notes the term "the United States of America"
does not include the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
2. The Japanese representative stated that fishing efforts by Japanese
nationals and vessels in the waters which are contiguous to the territorial
sea of the United States of America and extend to a limit of twelve nautical
miles from the baseline from which the United States territorial sea is measur
ed (hereinafter referred to as "the Waters") would not exceed the present
evel and that, with respect to dragnet fishing in the Waters, there would
be no marked change in the present method of operating the fishing gear.
3. It is recognized to be appropriate that, with respect to cases of gear
conflict which may arise between the fisheries of the two countries, prompt
consultation be held between the parties concerned as necessary in each
case.
4. It is agreed that, with respect to areas of heavy concentration of
fishing operations of both countries, each Government will take appropriate
measures aimed at prevention of damage to fishing gear, including measures
for improvement of the means for marking fixed gear, measures to ensure
that fixed gear is set with due regard for the operation of mobile gear and
measures to ensure that vessels operating with mobile gear will operate
with due regard for fixed gear.
5. It is recognized that it might not be possible to fully prevent parts
of longlines used in the tuna fishery from unintentionally and accidentally
drifting into that part of the Waters where the Japanese Government
agrees to ensure that Japanese nationals and vessels will not engage in the
tuna fishery. Such cases as described above, when verified by the cir
cumstances, will not be regarded as infringements of the above-mentioned
arrangements.
6. The Japanase representative stated that when fishing for tuna in
the Waters Japanese tuna fishermen would not attempt to seek out concen
trations of billfishes.
7. The United States representative expressed concern over the pos
sible effect in future of Japanese fishing off the coast of the States of Oregon
and Washington upon conservation of the fishery resources in those waters
and over possible conflict of gear therein between the fisheries of the two
countries.
The Japanese representative stated that the Government of Japan
would, at the request of the Government of the United States of America,
hold consultations as early as practicable with the Government of the
United States of America with regard to such problems as conservation
of resources and conflict of gear.
8. It is agreed that the two Governments will agree on an additional
area near Alaska where Japanese vessels will conduct loading operations,
should the need for such area 'become apparent.
9. The Japanese representative stated that salmon fishing operations
of nationals and vessels of Japan in the Waters would be conducted paying
due regard to the conditions of the runs of salmon of Bristol Bay origin.
The two Governments will hold consultations, if necessary, on the problem
of fishing for salmon of Bristol Bay origin.
