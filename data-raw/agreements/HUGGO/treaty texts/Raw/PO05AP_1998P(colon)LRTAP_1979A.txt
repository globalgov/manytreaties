national standards shall apply.5. for verification purposes, the interpretation of measurement results in relation to the limit value must also take into account the inaccuracy of the measurement method. a limit value is considered to be met if the result of the measurement, from which the inaccuracy of the measurement method is subtracted, does not exceed it.6. emissions of different congeners of pcdd/f are given in toxicity equivalents (te) in comparison to 2,3,7,8-tcdd using the system proposed by the nato committee on the challenges of modern society (nato-ccms) in 1988.ii. limit values for major stationary sources7. the following limit values, which refer to 11% o2 concentration in flue gas, apply to the following incinerator types:municipal solid waste (burning more than 3 tons per hour)0.1 ng te/m3medical solid waste (burning more than 1 ton per hour)0.5 ng te/m3hazardous waste (burning more than 1 ton per hour)0.2 ng te/m ANNEX vbest available techniques to control emissions of persistent organic pollutants from major stationaer sourcesi. introduction1. the purpose of this annex is to provide the parties to the convention with guidance in identifying best available techniques to allow them to meet the obligations in article 3, paragraph 5, of the protocol.2. "best available techniques" (bat) means the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of particular techniques for providing in principle the basis for emission limit values designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, generally to reduce emissions and their impact on the environment as a whole:- 'techniques' includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned;- 'available' techniques means those developed on a scale which allows implementation in the relevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable conditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced inside the territory of the party in question, as long as they are reasonably accessible to the operator;- 'best' means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment as a whole.in determining the best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the factors below, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and the principles of precaution and prevention:- the use of low-waste technology;- the use of less hazardous substances;- the furthering of recovery and recycling of substances generated and used in the process and of waste;- comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale;- technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;- the nature, effects and volume of the emissions concerned;- the commissioning dates for new or existing installations;- the time needed to introduce the best available technique;- the consumption and nature of raw materials (including water) used in the process and its energy efficiency;- the need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the emissions on the environment and the risks to it;- the need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment. the concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.3. information regarding the effectiveness and costs of control measures is based on documents received and reviewed by the task force and the preparatory working group on pops. unless otherwise indicated, the techniques listed are considered to be well established on the basis of operational experience.4. experience with new plants incorporating low-emission techniques, as well as with retrofitting of existing plants, is continuously growing. the regular elaboration and amendment of the annex will therefore be necessary. best available techniques (bat) identified for new plants can usually be applied to existing plants provided there is an adequate transition period and they are adapted.5. the annex lists a number of control measures which span a range of costs and efficiencies. the choice of measures for any particular case will depend on a number of factors, including economic circumstances, technological infrastructure and capacity, and any existing air pollution control measures.6. the most important pops emitted from stationary sources are:(a) polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (pcdd/f);(b) hexachlorobenzene (hcb);(c) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs).relevant definitions are provided in annex iii to the present protocol.ii. major stationary sources of pop emissions7. pcdd/f are emitted from thermal processes involving organic matter and chlorine as a result of incomplete combustion or chemical reactions. major stationary sources of pcdd/f may be as follows:(a) waste incineration, including co-incineration;(b) thermal metallurgical processes, e.g. production of aluminum and other non-ferrous metals, iron and steel;(c) combustion plants providing energy;(d) residential combustion; and(e) specific chemical production processes releasing intermediates and by-products.8. major stationary sources of pah emissions may be as follows:(a) domestic wood and coal heating;(b) open fires such as refuse burning, forest fires and after-crop burning;(c) coke and anode production;(d) aluminum production (via soederberg process); and(e) wood preservation installations, except for a party for which this category does not make a significant contribution to its total emissions of pah (as defined in annex iii).9. emissions of hcb result from the same type of thermal and chemical processes as those emitting pcdd/f, and hcb is formed by a similar mechanism. major sources of hcb emissions may be as follows:(a) waste incineration plants, including co-incineration;(b) thermal sources of metallurgical industries; and(c) use of chlorinated fuels in furnace installations.iii. general approaches to controlling emissions of pops10. there are several approaches to the control or prevention of pop emissions from stationary sources. these include the replacement of relevant feed materials, process modifications (including maintenance and operational control) and retrofitting existing plants. the following list provides a general indication of available measures, which may be implemented either separately or in combination:(a) replacement of feed materials which are pops or where there is a direct link between the materials and pop emissions from the source;(b) best environmental practices such as good housekeeping, preventive maintenance programmes, or process changes such as closed systems (for instance in cokeries or use of inert electrodes for electrolysis);(c) modification of process design to ensure complete combustion, thus preventing the formation of persistent organic pollutants, through the control of parameters such as incineration temperature or residence time;(d) methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic incineration or oxidation, dust precipitation, adsorption;(e) treatment of residuals, wastes and sewage sludge by, for example, thermal treatment or rendering them inert.11. the emission levels given for different measures in tables 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are generally case-specific. the figures or ranges give the emission levels as a percentage of the emission limit values using conventional techniques.12. cost-efficient considerations may be based on total costs per year per unit of abatement (including capital and operational costs). pop emission reduction costs should also be considered within the framework of the overall process economics, e.g. the impact of control measures and costs of production. given the many influencing factors, investment and operating cost figures are highly case-specific.iv. control techniques for the reduction of pcdd/f emissionsa. waste incineration13. waste incineration includes municipal waste, hazardous waste, medical waste and sewage sludge incineration.14. the main control measures for pcdd/f emissions from waste incineration facilities are:(a) primary measures regarding incinerated wastes;(b) primary measures regarding process techniques;(c) measures to control physical parameters of the combustion process and waste gases (e.g. temperature stages, cooling rate, o2 content, etc.);(d) cleaning of the flue gas; and(e) treatment of residuals from the cleaning process.15. the primary measures regarding the incinerated wastes, involving the management of feed material by reducing halogenated substances and replacing them by non-halogenated alternatives, are not appropriate for municipal or hazardous waste incineration. it is more effective to modify the incineration process and install secondary measures for flue-gas cleaning. the management of feed material is a useful primary measure for waste reduction and has the possible added benefit of recycling. this may result in indirect pcdd/f reduction by decreasing the waste amounts to be incinerated.16. the modification of process techniques to optimize combustion conditions is an important and effective measure for the reduction of pcdd/f emissions (usually 850°c or higher, assessment of oxygen supply depending on the heating value and consistency of the wastes, sufficient residence time - 850°c for ca. 2 sec - and turbulence of the gas, avoidance of cold gas regions in the incinerator, etc.). fluidized bed incinerators keep a lower temperature than 850°c with adequate emission results. for existing incinerators this would normally involve redesigning and/or replacing a plant - an option which may not be economically viable in all countries. the carbon content in ashes should be minimized.17. flue gas measures. the following measures are possibilities for lowering reasonably effectively the pcdd/f content in the flue gas. the de novo synthesis takes place at about 250 to 450°c. these measures are a prerequisite for further reductions to achieve the desired levels at the end of the pipe:(a) quenching the flue gases (very effective and relatively inexpensive);(b) adding inhibitors such as triethanolamine or triethylamine (can reduce oxides of nitrogen as well), but side-reactions have to be considered for safety reasons;(c) using dust collection systems for temperatures between 800 and 1000°c, e.g. ceramic filters and cyclones;(d) using low-temperature electric discharge systems; and(e) avoiding fly ash deposition in the flue gas exhaust system.18. methods for cleaning the flue gas are:(a) conventional dust precipitators for the reduction of particle-bound pcdd/f;(b) selective catalytic reduction (scr) or selective non-catalytic reduction (sncr);(c) adsorption with activated charcoal or coke in fixed or fluidized systems;(d) different types of adsorption methods and optimized scrubbing systems with mixtures of activated charcoal, open hearth coal, lime and limestone solutions in fixed bed, moving bed and fluidized bed reactors. the collection efficiency for gaseous pcdd/f can be improved with the use of a suitable pre-coat layer of activated coke on the surface of a bag filter;(e) h2o2-oxidation; and(f) catalytic combustion methods using different types of catalysts (i.e. pt/al2o3 or copperchromite catalysts with different promoters to stabilize the surface area and to reduce ageing of the catalysts).19. the methods mentioned above are capable of reaching emission levels of 0.1 ng te/m3 pcdd/f in the flue gas. however, in systems using activated charcoal or coke absorbers/filters care must be taken to ensure that fugitive carbon dust does not increase pcdd/f emissions downstream. also, it should be noted that absorbers and dedusting installations prior to catalysts (scr technique) yield pcdd/f-laden residues, which need to be reprocessed or require proper disposal.20. a comparison between the different measures to reduce pcdd/f in flue gas is very complex. the resulting matrix includes a wide range of industrial plants with different capacities and configuration. cost parameters include the reduction measures for minimizing other pollutants as well, such as heavy metals (particle-bound or not particle-bound). a direct relation for the reduction in pcdd/f emissions alone cannot, therefore, be isolated in most cases. a summary of the available data for the various control measures is given in table 1.table 1: comparison of different flue-gas cleaning measures and process modifications in waste incineration plants to reduce pcdd/f

many countries. specific medical wastes such as human anatomical parts, infected waste, needles, blood, plasma and cytostatica are treated as a special form of hazardous waste, while other medical wastes are frequently incinerated on-site in a batch operation. incinerators operating with batch systems can meet the same requirements for pcdd/f reduction as other waste incinerators.22. parties may wish to consider adopting policies to encourage the incineration of municipal and medical waste in large regional facilities rather than in smaller ones. this approach may make the application of bat more cost-effective.23. the treatment of residuals from the flue-gas cleaning process. unlike incinerator ashes, these residuals contain relatively high concentrations of heavy metals, organic pollutants (including pcdd/f), chlorides and sulphides. their method of disposal, therefore, has to be well controlled. wet scrubber systems in particular produce large quantities of acidic, contaminated liquid waste. some special treatment methods exist. they include:(a) the catalytic treatment of fabric filter dusts under conditions of low temperatures and lack of oxygen;(b) the scrubbing of fabric filter dusts by the 3-r process (extraction of heavy metals by acids and combustion for destruction of organic matter);(c) the vitrification of fabric filter dusts;(d) further methods of immobilization; and(e) the application of plasma technology.b. thermal processes in the metallurgical industry24. specific processes in the metallurgical industry may be important remaining sources of pcdd/f emissions. these are:(a) primary iron and steel industry (e.g. blast furnaces, sinter plants, iron pelletizing);(b) secondary iron and steel industry; and(c) primary and secondary non-ferrous metal industry (production of copper). pcdd/f emission control measures for the metallurgical industries are summarized in table 2.25. metal production and treatment plants with pcdd/f emissions can meet a maximum emission concentration of 0.1 ng te/m3 (if waste gas volume flow 5000 m3/h) using control measures.table 2: emission reduction of pcdd/f in the metallurgical

aluminum scrap shredders by using swim-sink separation techniques and grading through whirling stream deposition. medium/higha/ remaining emission compared to unreduced mode.sinter plants26. measurements at sinter plants in the iron and steel industry have generally shown pcdd/f emissions in the range of 0.4 to 4 ng te/m3. a single measurement at one plant without any control measures showed an emission concentration of 43 ng te/m3 .27. halogenated compounds may result in the formation of pcdd/f if they enter sinter plants in the feed materials (coke breeze, salt content in the ore) and in added recycled material (e.g. millscale, blast furnace top gas dust, filter dusts and sludges from waste water treatment). however, similarly to waste incineration, there is no clear link between the chlorine content of the feed materials and emissions of pcdd/f. an appropriate measure may be the avoidance of contaminated residual material and de-oiling or degreasing of millscale prior to its introduction into the sinter plant.28. the most effective pcdd/f emission reduction can be achieved using a combination of different secondary measures, as follows:(a) recirculating waste gas significantly reduces pcdd/f emissions. furthermore, the waste gas flow is reduced significantly, thereby reducing the cost of installing any additional end-of-pipe control systems;(b) installing fabric filters (in combination with electrostatic precipitators in some cases) or electrostatic precipitators with the injection of activated carbon/open-hearth coal/limestone mixtures into the waste gas;(c) scrubbing methods have been developed which include pre-quenching of the waste gas, leaching by high-performance scrubbing and separation by drip deposition. emissions of 0.2 to 0.4 ng te/m3 can be achieved. by adding suitable adsorption agents like lignite coal cokes/coal slack, an emission concentration of 0.1 ng te/m3 can be reached.primary and secondary production of copper29. existing plants for the primary and secondary production of copper can achieve a pcdd/f emission level of a few picograms to 2 ng te/m3 after flue-gas cleaning. a single copper shaft furnace emitted up to 29 ng te/m3 pcdd/f before optimization of the aggregates. generally, there is a wide range of pcdd/f emission values from these plants because of the large differences in raw materials used in differing aggregates and processes.30. generally, the following measures are suitable for reducing pcdd/f emissions:(a) pre-sorting scrap;(b) pretreating scrap, for example stripping of plastic or pvc coatings, pretreating cable scrap using only cold/mechanical methods;(c) quenching hot waste gases (providing utilization of heat), to reduce residence time in the critical region of temperature in the waste gas system;(d) using oxygen or oxygen-enriched air in firing, or oxygen injection in the shaft kiln (providing complete combustion and minimization of waste gas volume);(e) adsorption in a fixed bed reactor or fluidized jet stream reactor with activated charcoal or open-hearth coal dust; and(f) catalytic oxidation.production of steel31. pcdd/f emissions from converter steelworks for steel production and from hot blast cupola furnaces, electric furnaces and electric arc furnaces for the melting of cast iron are significantly lower than 0.1 ng te/m3 . cold-air furnaces and rotary tube furnaces (melting of cast iron) have higher pcdd/f emissions.32. electric arc furnaces used in secondary steel production can achieve an emission concentration value of 0.1 ng te/m3 if the following measures are used:(a) separate collection of emissions from loading and discharging; and(b) use of a fabric filter or an electrostatic precipitator in combination with coke injection.33. the feedstock to electric arc furnaces often contains oils, emulsions or greases. general primary measures for pcdd/f reduction can be sorting, de-oiling and de-coating of scraps, which may contain plastics, rubber, paints, pigments and vulcanizing additives.smelting plants in the secondary aluminum industry34. pcdd/f emissions from smelting plants in the secondary aluminum industry are in the range of approximately 0.1 to 14 ng te/m3 . these levels depend on the type of smelting aggregates, materials used and waste gas purification techniques employed.35. in summary, single- and multi-stage fabric filters with the addition of limestone/activated carbon/open-hearth coal in front of the filter meet the emission concentration of 0.1 ng te/m3 , with reduction efficiencies of 99%.36. the following measures can also be considered:(a) minimizing and separately removing and purifying differently contaminated waste gas flows;(b) avoiding waste gas particle deposition;(c) rapidly passing the critical temperature range;(d) improving the pre-sorting of scrap aluminum from shredders by using swim-sink separation techniques and grading through whirling stream deposition; and(e) improving the pre-cleaning of scrap aluminum by swarf decoating and swarf drying.37. options (d) and (e) are important because it is unlikely that modern fluxless smelting techniques (which avoid halide salt fluxes) will be able to handle the low-grade scrap that can be used in rotary kilns.38. discussions are continuing under the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic regarding the revision of an earlier recommendation to phase out the use of hexachloroethane in the aluminum industry.39. the melt can be treated using state-of-the-art technology, for example with nitrogen/chlorine mixtures in the ratio of between 9:1 and 8:2, gas injection equipment for fine dispersion and nitrogen pre-and post-flushing and vacuum degreasing. for nitrogen/chlorine mixtures, a pcdd/f emission concentration of about 0.03 ng te/m3 was measured (as compared to values of 1 ng te/m3 for treatment with chlorine only). chlorine is required for the removal of magnesium and other undesired components.c. combustion of fossil fuels in utility and industrial boilers40. in the combustion of fossil fuels in utility and industrial boilers (50 mw thermal capacity), improved energy efficiency and energy conservation will result in a decline in the emissions of all pollutants because of reduced fuel requirements. this will also result in a reduction in pcdd/f emissions. it would not be cost-effective to remove chlorine from coal or oil, but in any case the trend towards gas-fired stations will help to reduce pcdd/f emissions from this sector.41. it should be noted that pcdd/f emissions could increase significantly if waste material (sewage sludge, waste oil, rubber wastes, etc.) is added to the fuel. the combustion of wastes for energy supply should be undertaken only in installations using waste gas purification systems with highly efficient pcdd/f reduction (described in section a above).42. the application of techniques to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulates from the flue gas can also remove pcdd/f emissions. when using these techniques, pcdd/f removal efficiencies will vary from plant to plant. research is ongoing to develop pcdd/f removal techniques, but until such techniques are available on an industrial scale, no best available technique is identified for the specific purpose of pcdd/f removal.d. residential combustion43. the contribution of residential combustion appliances to total emissions of pcdd/f is less significant when approved fuels are properly used. in addition, large regional differences in emissions can occur due to the type and quality of fuel, geographical appliance density and usage.44. domestic fireplaces have a worse burn-out rate for hydrocarbons in fuels and waste gases than large combustion installations. this is especially true if they use solid fuels such as wood and coal, with pcdd/f emission concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 0.7 ng te/m3.45. burning packing material added to solid fuels increases pcdd/f emissions. even though it is prohibited in some countries, the burning of rubbish and packing material may occur in private households. due to increasing disposal charges, it must be recognized that household waste materials are being burned in domestic firing installations. the use of wood with the addition of waste packing material can lead to an increase in pcdd/f emissions from 0.06 ng te/m3 (exclusively wood) to 8 ng te/m3 (relative to 11% o2 by volume). these results have been confirmed by investigations in several countries in which up to 114 ng te/m3 (with respect to 13% oxygen by volume) was measured in waste gases from residential combustion appliances burning waste materials.46. the emissions from residential combustion appliances can be reduced by restricting the input materials to good-quality fuel and avoiding the burning of waste, halogenated plastics and other materials. public information programmes for the purchasers/operators of residential combustion appliances can be effective in achieving this goal.e. firing installations for wood (50 mw capacity)47. measurement results for wood-firing installations indicate that pcdd/f emissions above 0.1 ng te/m3 occur in waste gases especially during unfavourable burn-out conditions and/or when the substances burned have a higher content of chlorinated compounds than normal untreated wood. an indication of poor firing is the total carbon concentration in the waste gas. correlations have been found between co emissions, burn-out quality and pcdd/f emissions. table 3 summarizes some emission concentrations and factors for wood-firing installations.table 3: quantity-related emission concentrations and factors for wood-firing installationsfuel emission concentration (ng te/m3)emission factor(ng te/kg)emission factor (ng/gj)natural wood (beech tree) 0.02 - 0.10 0.23 - 1.3 12 - 70natural wood chips from forests 0.07 - 0.21 0.79 - 2.6 43 - 140chipboard 0.02 - 0.08 0.29 - 0.9 16 - 50urban waste wood 2.7 - 14.4 26 - 173 1400 - 9400residential waste 114 3230charcoal 0.0348. the combustion of urban waste wood (demolition wood) in moving grates leads to relatively high pcdd/f emissions, compared to non-waste wood sources. a primary measure for emission reduction is to avoid the use of treated waste wood in wood-firing installations. combustion of treated wood should be undertaken only in installations with the appropriate flue-gas cleaning to minimize pcdd/f emissions.v. control techniques for the reduction of pah emissionsa. coke production49. during coke production, pahs are released into the ambient air mainly:(a) when the oven is charged through the charging holes;(b) by leakages from the oven door, the ascension pipes and the charging hole lids; and(c) during coke pushing and coke cooling.50. benzo(a)pyrene (bap) concentration varies substantially between the individual sources in a coke battery. the highest bap concentrations are found on the top of the battery and in the immediate vicinity of the doors.51. pah from coke production can be reduced by technically improving existing integrated iron and steel plants. this might entail the closure and replacement of old coke batteries and the general reduction in coke production, for instance by injecting high-value coal in steel production.52. a pah reduction strategy for coke batteries should include the following technical measures:(a) charging the coke ovens:- particulate matter emission reduction when charging the coal from the bunker into the charging cars;- closed systems for coal transfer when coal pre-heating is used;- extraction of filling gases and subsequent treatment, either by passing the gases into the adjacent oven or by passing via a collecting main to an incinerator and a subsequent dedusting device. in some cases the extracted filling gases may be burned on the charging cars, but the environmental performance and safety of these charging-car-based systems is less satisfactory. sufficient suction should be generated by steam or water injection in the ascension pipes;(b) emissions at charging hole lids during coking operation should be avoided by:- using charging hole lids with highly efficient sealing;- luting the charging hole lids with clay (or equally effective material) after each charging operation;- cleaning the charging hole lids and frames before closing the charging hole;- keeping oven ceilings free from coal residuals;(c) ascension pipe lids should be equipped with water seals to avoid gas and tar emissions, and the proper operation of the seals should be maintained by regular cleaning;(d) coke oven machinery for operating the coke oven doors should be equipped with systems for cleaning the seals' surfaces on the oven door frames and oven doors;(e) coke oven doors:- highly effective seals should be used (e.g. spring-loaded membrane doors);- seals on the oven doors and door frames should be cleaned thoroughly at every handling operation;- doors should be designed in a manner that allows the installation of particulate matter extraction systems with connection to a dedusting device (via a collecting main) during pushing operations;(f) the coke transfer machine should be equipped with an integrated hood, stationary duct and stationary gas cleaning system (preferably a fabric filter);(g) low-emission procedures should be applied for coke cooling, e.g. dry coke cooling. the replacement of a wet quenching process by dry coke cooling should be preferred, so long as the generation of waste water is avoided by using a closed circulation system. the dusts generated when dry quenched coke is handled should be reduced.53. a coke-making process referred to as "non-recovery coke-making" emits significantly less pah than the more conventional by-product recovery process. this is because the ovens operate under negative pressure, thereby eliminating leaks to the atmosphere from the coke oven doors. during coking, the raw coke oven gas is removed from the ovens by a natural draught, which maintains a negative pressure in the ovens. these ovens are not designed to recover the chemical by-products from raw coke oven gas. instead, the off gases from the coking process (including pah) are burned efficiently at high temperatures and with long residence times. the waste heat from this incineration is used to provide the energy for coking, and excess heat may be used to generate steam. the economics of this type of coking operation may require a cogeneration unit to produce electricity from the excess steam. currently there is only one non-recovery coke plant operating in the united states, and one is in operation in australia. the process is basically a horizontal sole-flue non-recovery coke oven with an incineration chamber adjoining two ovens. the process provides for alternate charging and coking schedules between the two ovens. thus, one oven is always providing the incineration chamber with coke gases. the coke gas combustion in the incineration chamber provides the necessary heat source. the incineration chamber design provides the necessary dwell time (approximately 1 second) and high temperatures (minimum of 900°c).54. an effective monitoring programme for leakages from coke oven door seals, ascension pipes and charging hole lids should be operated. this implies the monitoring and recording of leakages and immediate repair or maintenance. a significant reduction of diffuse emissions can thus be achieved.55. retrofitting existing coke batteries to facilitate condensation of flue gases from all sources (with heat recovery) results in a pah reduction of 86% to more than 90% in air (without regard to waste water treatment). investment costs can be amortized in five years, taking into account recovered energy, heated water, gas for synthesis and saved cooling water.56. increasing coke oven volumes results in a decrease in the total number of ovens, oven door openings (amount of pushed ovens per day), number of seals in a coke battery and consequently pah emissions. productivity increases in the same way by decreasing operating and personnel costs.57. dry coke cooling systems require a higher investment cost than wet methods. higher operating costs can be compensated for by heat recovery in a process of pre-heating the coke. the energy efficiency of a combined dry coke cooling/coal pre-heating system rises from 38 to 65%. coal preheating boosts productivity by 30%. this can be raised to 40% because the coking process is more homogeneous.58. all tanks and installations for the storage and treatment of coal tar and coal tar products must be equipped with an efficient vapour recovery return and/or vapour destruction system. the operating costs of vapour destruction systems can be reduced in an auto thermal after-burning mode if the concentration of the carbon compounds in the waste is high enough.59. table 4 summarizes pah emission reduction measures in coke production plants.table 4: pah emission control for coke productionmanagement options emission level (%) a/estimated costs management risksretrofitting of old plants with condensation of emitted flue gases from all sources includes the following

from anode production have to be dealt with in a similar fashion as those from coke production.61. the following secondary measures for emission reduction of pah-contaminated dust are used:(a) electrostatic tar precipitation;(b) combination of a conventional electrostatic tar filter with a wet electrostatic filter as a more efficient technical measure;(c) thermal after-burning of the waste gases; and(d) dry scrubbing with limestone/petroleum coke or aluminum oxide (al2o3).62. the operating costs in thermal after-burning can be reduced in an auto thermal after-burning mode if the concentration of carbon compounds in the waste gas is high enough. table 5 summarizes pah emission control measures for anode production.table 5: pah emission control for anode productionmanagement

industry63. aluminum is produced from aluminum oxide (al2o3) by electrolysis in pots (cells) electrically connected in series. pots are classified as prebake or soederberg pots, according to the type of the anode.64. prebake pots have anodes consisting of calcined (baked) carbon blocks, which are replaced after partial consumption. soederberg anodes are baked in the cell, with a mixture of petroleum coke and coal tar pitch acting as a binder.65. very high pah emissions are released from the soederberg process. primary abatement measures include modernization of existing plants and optimization of the processes, which could reduce pah emissions by 70-90%. an emission level of 0.015 kg b(a)p/ton of al could be reached. replacing the existing soederberg cells by prebaked ones would require major reconstruction of the existing process, but would nearly eliminate the pah emissions. the capital costs of such replacements are very high.66. table 6 summarizes pah emission

can be detected from stoves or open fireplaces especially when wood or coal is used. households could be a significant source of pah emissions. this is the result of the use of fireplaces and small firing installations burning solid fuels in households. in some countries the usual fuel for stoves is coal. coal-burning stoves emit less pah than wood-burning ones, because of their higher combustion temperatures and more consistent fuel quality.68. furthermore, combustion systems with optimized operation characteristics (e.g. burning rate) effectively control pah emissions from residential combustion. optimized combustion conditions include optimized combustion chamber design and optimized supply of air. there are several techniques which optimize combustion conditions and reduce emissions. there is a significant difference in emissions between different techniques. a modern wood-fired boiler with a water accumulation tank, representing bat, reduces the emission by more than 90% compared to an outdated boiler without a water accumulation tank. a modern boiler has three different zones: a fireplace for the gasification of wood, a gas combustion zone with ceramics or other material which allow temperatures of some 1000°c, and a convection zone. the convection part where the water absorbs the heat should be sufficiently long and effective so that the gas temperature can be reduced from 1000°c to 250°c or less. there are also several techniques to supplement old and outdated boilers, for example with water accumulation tanks, ceramic inserts and pellet burners.69. optimized burning rates are accompanied by low emissions of carbon monoxide (co), total hydrocarbons (thc) and pahs. setting limits (type approval regulations) on the emission of co and thcs also affects the emission of pahs. low emission of co and thcs results in low emission of pahs. since measuring pah is far more expensive than measuring co, it is more cost-effective to set a limit value for co and thcs. work is continuing on a proposal for a cen standard for coal- and wood fired boilers up to 300 kw (see table 7).table 7: draft cen standards in 1997class 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2

levels in mg/m3 at 10% o2.70. emissions from residential wood combustion stoves can be reduced:(a) for existing stoves, by public information and awareness programmes regarding proper stove operation, the use of untreated wood only, fuel preparation procedures and the correct seasoning of wood for moisture content; and(b) for new stoves, by the application of product standards as described in the draft cen standard (and equivalent product standards in the united states and canada).71. more general measures for pah emission reduction are those related to the development of centralized systems for households and energy conservation such as improved thermal insulation to reduce energy consumption.72. information is summarized in table 8.table 8: pah emission control for residential

to unreduced mode.e. wood preservation installations73. wood preservation with pah-containing coal-tar products may be a major source of pah emissions to the air. emissions may occur during the impregnation process itself as well as during storage, handling and use of the impregnated wood in the open air.74. the most widely used pah-containing coal-tar products are carbolineum and creosote. both are coal tar distillates containing pahs for the protection of timber (wood) against biological attack.75. pah emissions from wood preservation, installations and storage facilities may be reduced using several approaches, implemented either separately or in combination, such as:(a) requirements on storage conditions to prevent pollution of soil and surface water by leached pah and contaminated rainwater (e.g. storage sites impermeable to rainwater, roof cover, reuse of contaminated water for the impregnation process, quality demands for the material produced);(b) measures to reduce atmospheric emissions at impregnation plants (e.g. the hot wood should be cooled down from 90°c to 30°c at least before transport to storage sites. however, an alternative method using pressure steam under vacuum conditions to impregnate the wood with creosote should be highlighted as bat);(c) the optimum loading of wood preservative, which gives adequate protection to the treated wood product in situ, can be regarded as a bat as this will reduce the demand for replacements, thereby reducing emissions from the wood preservation installations;(d) using wood preservation products with a lower content of those pahs that are pops:- possibly using modified creosote which is taken to be a distillation fraction boiling between 270°c and 355°c, which reduces both the emissions of the more volatile pahs and the heavier, more toxic pahs;- discouraging the use of carbolineum would also reduce pah emissions;(e) evaluating and then using, as appropriate, alternatives, such as those in table 9, that minimize reliance on pah-based products.76. burning of impregnated wood gives rise to pah emissions and other harmful substances. if burning does take place, it should be done in installations with adequate abatement techniques.table 9: possible alternatives to wood preservation involving pah-based productsmanagement options management risksuse of alternative materials for application in construction:other environmental problems have to be evaluated such as:- sustainably produced hardwood (riverbanks, fences, gates);- availability of suitably produced wood;- plastics (horticulture posts); - emissions caused by the production and disposal of plastics, especially pvc.- concrete (railway sleepers);- replacement of artificial constructions by natural ones (such as riverbanks, fences, etc.);- use of untreated wood.there are several alternative wood-preserving techniques in development which do not include impregnation with pah-based products ANNEX vitimescales

combination with 1,2-dichloromethane is used as a scavenger in leaded petrol. moreover, pcdd/f are formed during the combustion process in the engine.the application of three-way catalytic converters for cars will require the use of unleaded fuel. the addition of scavengers and other halogenated compounds to petrol and other fuels and to lubricants should be avoided as far as possible.7. table 1 summarizes measures for pcdd/f emission control from the exhaust from road transport motor vehicles.table 1: pcdd/f emission control for the exhaust from road transport motor vehiclesmanagement options management risksavoiding adding halogenated compounds to fuels- 1,2-dichloromethane- 1,2-dichloromethane and corresponding bromo compounds as scavengers in leaded fuels for spark ignition

closed-loop three-way catalytic converters with spark ignition enginesavoiding halogenated additives in fuels and lubricants.iii. control measures for emissions of pops from mobile sourcesa. pop emissions from motor vehicles8. pop emissions from motor vehicles occur as particle-bound pahs emitted from diesel-fueled vehicles. to a minor extent pahs are also emitted by petrol-fueled vehicles.9. lubrication oil and fuels may contain halogenated compounds as a result of additives or the production process. these compounds may be transformed during combustion into pcdd/f and subsequently emitted with the exhaust gases.b. inspection and maintenance10. for diesel-fueled mobile sources, the effectiveness of the control of emissions of pahs may be ensured through programmes to test the mobile sources periodically for particulate emissions, opacity during free acceleration, or equivalent methods.11. for petrol-fueled mobile sources, the effectiveness of the control of emissions of pahs (in addition to other exhaust components) may be ensured through programmes to test periodically the fuel metering and the efficiency of the catalytic converter.c. techniques to control pah emissions from diesel- and petrol-fueled motor vehicles1. general aspects of control technologies12. it is important to ensure that vehicles are designed to meet emission standards while in service. this can be done by ensuring conformity of production, lifetime durability, warranty of emission-control components, and recall of defective vehicles. for vehicles in use, continued emission control performance can be ensured by an effective inspection and maintenance programme.2. technical measures for emission control13. the following measures to control pah emissions are important:(a) fuel-quality specifications and engine modifications to control emissions before they are formed (primary measures); and(b) addition of exhaust treatment systems, e.g. oxidizing catalysts or particle traps (secondary measures).(a) diesel engines14. diesel-fuel modification can yield two benefits: a lower sulphur content reduces emissions of particles and increases the conversion efficiency of oxidizing catalysts, and the reduction in di- and triaromatic compounds reduces the formation and emission of pahs.15. a primary measure to reduce emissions is to modify the engine to achieve more complete combustion. many different modifications are in use. in general, vehicle exhaust composition is influenced by changes in combustion chamber design and by higher fuel injection pressures. at present, most diesel engines rely on mechanical engine control systems. newer engines increasingly use computerized electronic control systems with greater potential flexibility in controlling emissions. another technology to control emissions is the combined technology of turbocharging and intercooling. this system is successful in reducing nox as well as increasing fuel economy and power output. for heavy- and light-duty engines the use of intake manifold tuning is also a possibility.16. controlling the lubricating oil is important to reduce particulate matter (pm), as 10 to 50% of particulate matter is formed from engine oil. oil consumption can be reduced by improved engine manufacturing specifications and improved engine seals.17. secondary measures to control emissions are additions of exhaust treatment systems. in general, for diesel engines the use of an oxidizing catalyst in combination with a particulate filter has been shown to be effective in reducing pah emissions. a particle trap oxidizer is being evaluated. it is located in the exhaust system to trap pm and can provide some regeneration of the filter by burning the collected pm, through electrical heating of the system or some other means of regeneration. for proper regeneration of passive system traps during normal operation, a burner-assisted regeneration system or the use of additives is required.(b) petrol engines18. pah-reduction measures for petrol-fueled engines are primarily based on the use of a closed loop three-way catalytic converter, which reduces pahs as part of the hc emission reductions.19. improved cold start behaviour reduces organic emissions in general and pahs in particular (for instance start-up catalysts, improved fuel evaporation/atomization, heated catalysts).20. table 2 summarizes measures for pah emission control from the exhaust from road transport motor vehicles.table 2: pah emission control for the exhaust from road transport motor
