prevention of pollution from industry and municipalities" are inserted.after part i new regulations are inserted as follows:part ii; prevention of pollution from agricultureregulation 1; general provisionsin accordance with the relevant parts of this convention the contracting parties shall apply the measures described below and take into account best environment practice (bep) and best available technology (bat) to reduce the pollution from agricultural activities. the contracting parties shall elaborate guidelines containing elements specified below and report to the commission.regulation 2; plant nutrientsthe contracting parties shall integrate the following basic principles into national legislation or guidelines and adapt to the prevailing conditions within the country to reduce the adverse environmental effects of agriculture. specified requirements levels shall be considered to be a minimum base for national legislation.1. animal densityto ensure that manure is not produced in excess in comparison to the amount of arable land, there must be a balance between the amount of animals on the farm and the amount of land available for spreading manure, expressed as animal density. the maximum amount of animals should be precised with consideration taken to the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen in manure and the crops requirements of plant nutrients.2. manure storagemanure storage must be of such a quality that prevents losses. the storage capacity shall be sufficiently large, to ensure that manure only will be spread when the plants can utilize nutrients. the minimum level to be required should be 6 months storage capacity. urine and slurry stores should be covered or handled by a method that efficiently reduces ammonia emissions.3. agricultural waste water and silage effluentswaste water from animal housings should either be stored in urine or slurry stores or else be treated in some suitable manner to prevent pollution. effluents from the preparation and storage of silage should be collected and directed to storages for urine or liquid manure.4. application of organic manuresorganic manures (slurry, solid manure, urine, sewage sludge, composts, etc) shall be spread in a way that minimizes the risk for loss of plant nutrients and should not be spread on soils that are frozen [footnote: to be defined by national legislation depending on the regional climate and weather conditions.]), water saturated or are covered with snow. organic manures should be incorporated as soon as possible after application on bare soils. periods shall be defined when no application is accepted.5. application rates for nutrientsapplication rates for nutrients should not exceed the crops nutrient requirements. national guidelines should be developed with fertilizing recommendations and they should take reference to:a) soil conditions, soil nutrient content, soil type and slope;b) climatic conditions and irrigation;c) land use and agricultural practices, including crop rotation systems;d) all external potential nutrient sources.6. winter crop coverin relevant regions the cultivated area should be sufficiently covered by crops in winter and autumn to effectively reduce the loss of plant nutrients7. water protection measures and nutrient reduction areasa) surface waterbuffer zones, riparian zones or sedimentation ponds should be established, if necessary.b) ground waterground water protection zones should be established if necessary. appropriate measures such as reduced fertilization rates, zones where manure spreading is prohibited and permanent grass land areas should be established.c) nutrient reduction areaswetland areas should be retained and where possible restored, to be able to reduce plant nutrient losses and to retain biological diversity.regulation 3; plant protection productsplant protection products shall only be handled and used according to a national risk reduction strategy which shall be based on best environmental practice (bep). the strategy should be based on an inventory of the existing problems and define suitable goals. it shall include measures such as:1. registration and approvalplant protection products shall not be sold, imported or applied until registration and approval for such purposes has been granted by the national authorities.2. storage and handlingstorage and handling of plant protection products shall be carried out so that the risks of spillage or leakage are prevented. some crucial areas are transportation and filling and cleaning of equipment. other dispersal of plant protection products outside the treated agricultural land area shall be prevented. waste of plant protection products shall be disposed of according to national legislation.3. licencea licence shall be required for commercial use of plant protection products. to obtain a licence suitable education and training on how to handle plant protection products with a minimum of impact on health and the environment shall be required. the users' knowledge regarding the handling and usage of plant protection products shall be updated regularly.4. application technologyapplication technology and practice should be designed to prevent unintentional drift or run-off of plant protection products. establishment of protection zones along surface waters should be encouraged. application by aircraft shall be forbidden; exceptional cases require authorization.5. testing of spraying equipmenttesting of spraying equipment at regular intervals shall be promoted to ensure a reliable result when spraying with plant protection products.6. alternative methods of controldevelopment of alternative methods for plant protection control should be encouraged.regulation 4; environmental permitsfarms with livestock production above certain size should require approval with regard to environmental aspects and impacts of the farms.regulation 5; environmental monitoringthe contracting parties shall develop projects to assess the effects of measures and the impacts of the agricultural sector on the environment.regulation 6; education, information and extension servicethe contracting parties shall promote systems for education, information and extension (advisory service) on environmental issues in the agricultural sector.
