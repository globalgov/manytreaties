the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland,desiring to define a regime of fisheries of a permanent character;have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1(1) each contracting party recognizes the right of any other contracting party to establish the fishery regime described in articles 2 to 6 of the present convention.(2) each contracting party retains however the right to maintain the fishery regime which it applies at the date on which the present convention is opened for signature, if this regime is more favourable to the fishing of other countries than the regime described in articles 2 to 6 ARTICLE 2the coastal state has the exclusive right to fish and exclusive jurisdiction in matters of fisheries within the belt of six miles measured from the baseline of its territorial sea ARTICLE 3within the belt between six and twelve miles measured from the baseline of the territorial sea, the right to fish shall be exercised only by the coastal state and by such other contracting parties, the fishing vessels of which have habitually fished in that belt between 1st january, 1953 and 31st december 1962 ARTICLE 4fishing vessels of the contracting parties, other than the coastal state, permitted to fish under article 3, shall not direct their fishing effort towards stocks of fish or fishing grounds substantially different from those which they have habitually exploited. the coastal state may enforce this rule ARTICLE 5(1) within the belt mentioned in article 3 the coastal state has the power to regulate the fisheries and to enforce such regulations, including regulations to give effect to internationally agreed measures of conservation, provided that there shall be no discrimination in form or in fact against fishing vessels of other contracting parties fishing in conformity with articles 3 and 4.(2) before issuing regulations, the coastal state shall inform the other contracting parties concerned and consult those contracting parties, if they so wish ARTICLE

of these contracting parties is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to establish a fisheries regime beyond the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the low water lines of the coasts of the contracting parties concerned ARTICLE 8(1) once a contracting party applies the regime described in articles 2 to 6, any right to fish which it may thereafter grant to a state not a contracting party shall extend automatically to the other contracting parties, whether or not they could claim this right by virtue of habitual fishing, to the extent that the state not a contracting party avails itself effectively and habitually of that right.(2) if a contracting party which has established the regime described in articles 2 to 6 should grant to another contracting party any right to fish which the latter cannot claim under articles 3 and 4, the same right shall extend automatically to all other contracting parties ARTICLE 9(1) in order to allow fishermen of other contracting parties, who have habitually fished in the belt provided for in article 2 to adapt themselves to their exclusion from that belt, a contracting party which establishes the regime provided for in articles 2 to 6, shall grant to such fishermen the right to fish in that belt for a transitional period, to be determined by agreement between the contracting parties concerned.(2) if a contracting party establishes the regime described in articles 2 to 6, it may, notwithstanding the provisions of article 2, continue to accord the right to fish in the whole or part of the belt provided for in article 2 to other contracting parties of which the fishermen have habitually fished in the area by reason of voisinage arrangements ARTICLE 10nothing in the
