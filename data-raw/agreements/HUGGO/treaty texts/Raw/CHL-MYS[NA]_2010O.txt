condition.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Parties shall apply the principles set out in
the Decision of the Committee on Principles for the Development of International
Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2,5 and Annex 3 of

January 1995, G/TBT/1/Rev.8, 23 May 2002, Section IX.
Article 7.6: Technical Regulations

conducted in the territory of the other Party, it shall, on request of that other Party,

assessing conformity with a specific technical regulation or standard in its territory and
refuses to accredit, approve, license, or otherwise recognise a body assessing 
144
conformity with that technical regulation or standard in the territory of the other Party, it
shall, on request of that other Party, explain the reasons for its decision.
7. Where a Party declines a request from the other Party to engage in negotiations

shall, on request of that other Party, explain the reasons for its decision.
Article 7.9: Transparency

observe paragraph 1 in relation to the development of standards and voluntary

technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure and the rationale
for the approach the Party is proposing; and

point the Party has established under Article 10 of the TBT Agreement at
the same time as it notifies WTO Members of the proposal pursuant to the
TBT Agreement.
Each Party should allow at least 60 days after it transmits a proposal under
subparagraph (b) for the public and the other Party to make comments in writing on the
proposal.

customs duty pursuant to this Agreement, an originating good of the other Party is being
imported into the Party’s territory in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or

in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to
the value of the additional customs duties expected to result from the measure. Such
consultations shall begin within 30 days of the imposition of the measure.
2. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement on compensation within 30 days
after the consultations commence, the exporting Party shall be free to suspend the

difficult to repair, a Party may take a provisional bilateral safeguard measure, which
shall take the form of the measure set out in subparagraph 2 (a) or (b) of Article 8.4

imports of an originating good have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to
a domestic industry.
2. The Party shall deliver a written notice to the other Party prior to applying a
provisional bilateral safeguard measure. Consultations between the Parties on the
application of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be initiated not later than
seven days after the provisional bilateral safeguard measure is taken.

days. During that period, the pertinent requirements of Article 8.6 shall be met. The
duration of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be counted as a part of the
period referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 8.5.

measure shall be refunded if the subsequent investigation referred to in Article 8.6 does
not determine that increased imports of the originating good have caused or threatened
to cause serious injury to a domestic industry.
