antarctic treaty area which relate to scientific research programmes, tourism and all other governmental and non-governmental activities in the antarctic treaty area for which advance notice is required under article vii(5) of the antarctic treaty, including associated logistic support activities. measures and plans for preventing and responding to such emergencies are also included in this annex. it shall apply to all tourist vessels that enter the antarctic treaty area. it shall also apply to environmental emergencies in the antarctic treaty area which relate to other vessels and

out in the antarctic treaty area, and does not include a juridical person that is a contractor or subcontractor acting on behalf of a state operator;(d) "operator of the party" means an operator that organises, in that party's territory, activities to be carried out in the antarctic treaty area, and:(i) those activities are subject to authorisation by that party for the antarctic treaty area; or(ii) in the case of a party which does not formally authorise activities for the antarctic treaty area, those activities are subject to a comparable regulatory process by that party.the terms "its operator", "party of the operator", and "party of that operator" shall be interpreted in accordance with this definition;(e) "reasonable", as applied to preventative measures and response action, means measures or actions which are appropriate, practicable, proportionate and based on the availability of objective criteria and information, including:(i) risks to the antarctic environment, and

extent of that emergency and its impact;(g) "the parties" means the states for which this annex has become effective in accordance with article 9 of the protocol ARTICLE 3: preventative measures1. each party shall require its operators to undertake reasonable preventative measures that are designed to reduce the risk of environmental emergencies and their potential adverse impact.2. preventative measures may include:(a) specialised structures or equipment incorporated into the design and construction of facilities and means of transportation;(b) specialised procedures incorporated into the operation or maintenance of facilities and means of transportation; and(c) specialised training of personnel ARTICLE 4: contingency plans1. each party shall require its operators to:(a) establish contingency plans for responses to incidents with potential adverse impacts on the antarctic environment or dependent and associated ecosystems; and(b) co-operate in the formulation and implementation of such contingency plans.2. contingency plans shall include, when appropriate, the following components:(a) procedures for conducting an assessment of the nature of the incident;(b) notification procedures;(c) identification and mobilisation of resources;(d) response plans;(e) training;(f) record keeping; and(g) demobilisation.3. each party shall establish and implement procedures for immediate notification of, and co-operative responses to, environmental emergencies, and shall promote the use of notification procedures and co-operative response procedures by its operators that cause environmental emergencies ARTICLE 5: response action1. each party shall require each of its operators to take prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies arising from the activities of that operator.2. in the event that an operator does not take prompt and effective response action, the party of that operator and other parties are encouraged to take such action, including through their agents and operators specifically authorised by them to take such action on their behalf.3.(a) other parties wishing to take response action to an environmental emergency pursuant to paragraph 2 above shall notify their intention to the party of the operator and the secretariat of the antarctic treaty beforehand with a view to the party of the operator taking response action itself, except where a threat of significant and harmful impact to the antarctic environment is imminent and it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to take immediate response action, in which case they shall notify the party of the operator and the secretariat of the antarctic treaty as soon as possible.(b) such other parties shall not take response action to an environmental emergency pursuant to paragraph 2 above, unless a threat of significant and harmful impact to the antarctic environment is imminent and it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to take immediate response action, or the party of the operator has failed within a reasonable time to notify the secretariat of the antarctic treaty that it will take the response action itself, or where that response action has not been taken within a reasonable time after such notification.(c) in the case that the party of the operator takes response action itself, but is willing to be assisted by another party or parties, the party of the operator shall coordinate the response action.4. however, where it is unclear which, if any, party is the party of the operator or it appears that there may be more than one such party, any party taking response action shall make best endeavours to consult as appropriate and shall, where practicable, notify the secretariat of the antarctic treaty of the circumstances.5. parties taking response action shall consult and coordinate their action with all other parties taking response action, carrying out activities in the vicinity of the environmental emergency, or otherwise impacted by the environmental emergency, and shall, where practicable, take into account all relevant expert guidance which has been provided by permanent observer delegations to the antarctic treaty consultative meeting, by other organisations, or by other relevant experts ARTICLE 6: liability1. an operator that fails to take prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies arising from its activities shall be liable to pay the costs of response action taken by parties pursuant to article 5(2) to such parties.2.(a) when a state operator should have taken prompt and effective response action but did not, and no response action was taken by any party, the state operator shall be liable to pay the costs of the response action which should have been undertaken, into the fund referred to in article 12.(b) when a non-state operator should have taken prompt and effective response action but did not, and no response action was taken by any party, the non-state operator shall be liable to pay an amount of money that reflects as much as possible the costs of the response action that should have been taken. such money is to be paid directly to the fund referred to in article 12, to the party of that operator or to the party that enforces the mechanism referred to in article 7(3). a party receiving such money shall make best efforts to make a contribution to the fund referred to in article 12 which at least equals the money received from the operator.3. liability shall be strict.4. when an environmental emergency arises from the activities of two or more operators, they shall be jointly and severally liable, except that an operator which establishes that only part of the environmental emergency results from its activities shall be liable in respect of that part only.5. notwithstanding that a party is liable under this article for its failure to provide for prompt and effective response action to environmental emergencies caused by its warships, naval auxiliaries, or other ships or aircraft owned or operated by it and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service, nothing in this annex is intended to affect the sovereign immunity under international law of such warships, naval auxiliaries, or other ships or aircraft ARTICLE 7: actions1. only a party that has taken response action pursuant to article 5(2) may bring an action against a non-state operator for liability pursuant to article 6(1) and such action may be brought in the courts of not more than one party where the operator is incorporated or has its principal place of business or his or her habitual place of residence. however, should the operator not be incorporated in a party or have its principal place of business or his or her habitual place of residence in a party, the action may be brought in the courts of the party of the operator within the meaning of article 2(d). such actions for compensation shall be brought within three years of the commencement of the response action or within three years of the date on which the party bringing the action knew or ought reasonably to have known the identity of the operator, whichever is later. in no event shall an action against a non-state operator be commenced later than 15 years after the commencement of the response action.2. each party shall ensure that its courts possess the necessary jurisdiction to entertain actions under paragraph 1 above.3. each party shall ensure that there is a mechanism in place under its domestic law for the enforcement of article 6(2)(b) with respect to any of its non-state operators within the meaning of article 2(d), as well as where possible with respect to any non-state operator that is incorporated or has its principal place of business or his or her habitual place of residence in that party. each party shall inform all other parties of this mechanism in accordance with article 13(3) of the protocol. where there are multiple parties that are capable of enforcing article 6(2)(b) against any given non-state operator under this paragraph, such parties should consult amongst themselves as to which party should take enforcement action. the mechanism referred to in this paragraph shall not be invoked later than 15 years after the date the party seeking to invoke the mechanism became aware of the environmental emergency.4. the liability of a party as a state operator under article 6(1) shall be resolved only in accordance with any enquiry procedure which may be established by the parties, the provisions of articles 18, 19 and 20 of the protocol and, as applicable, the schedule to the protocol on arbitration.5.(a) the liability of a party as a state operator under article 6(2)(a)shall be resolved only by the antarctic treaty consultative meeting and, should the question remain unresolved, only in accordance with any enquiry procedure which may be established by the parties, the provisions of articles 18, 19 and 20 of the protocol and, as applicable, the schedule to the protocol on arbitration.(b) the costs of the response action which should have been undertaken and was not, to be paid by a state operator into the fund referred to in article 12, shall be approved by means of a decision. the antarctic treaty consultative meeting should seek the advice of the committee on environmental protection as appropriate.6. under this annex, the provisions of articles 19(4), 19(5), and 20(1) of the protocol, and, as applicable, the schedule to the protocol on arbitration, are only applicable to liability of a party as a state operator for compensation for response action that has been undertaken to an environmental emergency or for payment into the fund ARTICLE 8: exemptions from liability1. an operator shall not be liable pursuant to article 6 if it proves that the environmental emergency was caused by:(a) an act or omission necessary to protect human life or safety;(b) an event constituting in the circumstances of antarctica a natural disaster of an exceptional character, which could not have been reasonably foreseen, either generally or in the particular case, provided all reasonable preventative measures have been taken that are designed to reduce the risk of environmental emergencies and their potential adverse impact;(c) an act of terrorism; or(d) an act of belligerency against the activities of the operator.2. a party, or its agents or operators specifically authorised by it to take such action on its behalf, shall not be liable for an environmental emergency resulting from response action taken by it pursuant to article 5(2) to the extent that such response action was reasonable in all the circumstances ARTICLE 9: limits of liability1. the maximum amount for which each operator may be liable under article 6(1) or article 6(2), in respect of each environmental emergency, shall be as follows:(a) for an environmental emergency arising from an event involving a ship:(i) one million sdr for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons;(ii) for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, the following amount in addition to that referred to in (i) above:- for each ton from 2,001 to 30,000 tons, 400 sdr;- for each ton from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 300 sdr; and- for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 200 sdr;(b) for an environmental emergency arising from an event which does not involve a ship, three million sdr.2.(a) notwithstanding paragraph 1(a) above, this annex shall not affect:(i) the liability or right to limit liability under any applicable international limitation of liability treaty; or(ii) the application of a reservation made under any such treaty to exclude the application of the limits therein for certain claims;provided that the applicable limits are at least as high as the following: for a ship with a tonnage not exceeding 2,000 tons, one million sdr; and for a ship with a tonnage in excess thereof, in addition, for a ship with a tonnage between 2,001 and 30,000 tons, 400 sdr for each ton; for a ship with a tonnage from 30,001 to 70,000 tons, 300 sdr for each ton; and for each ton in excess of 70,000 tons, 200 sdr for each ton.(b) nothing in subparagraph (a) above shall affect either the limits of liability set out in paragraph 1(a) above that apply to a party as a state operator, or the rights and obligations of parties that are not parties to any such treaty as mentioned above, or the application of article 7(1) and article 7(2).3. liability shall not be limited if it is proved that the environmental emergency resulted from an act or omission of the operator, committed with the intent to cause such emergency, or recklessly and with knowledge that such emergency would probably result.4. the antarctic treaty consultative meeting shall review the limits in paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) above every three years, or sooner at the request of any party. any amendments to these limits, which shall be determined after consultation amongst the parties and on the basis of advice including scientific and technical advice, shall be made under the procedure set out in article 13(2).5. for the purpose of this article:(a) "ship" means a vessel of any type whatsoever operating in the marine environment and includes hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft and fixed or floating platforms;(b) "sdr" means the special drawing rights as defined by the international monetary fund;(c) a

above, a party may maintain self-insurance in respect of its state operators, including those carrying out activities in the furtherance of scientific research ARTICLE 12: the fund1. the secretariat of the antarctic treaty shall maintain and administer a fund, in accordance with decisions including terms of reference to be adopted by the parties, to provide, inter alia, for the reimbursement of the reasonable and justified costs incurred by a party or parties in taking response action pursuant to article 5(2).2. any party or parties may make a proposal to the antarctic treaty consultative meeting for reimbursement to be paid from the fund. such a proposal may be approved by the antarctic treaty consultative meeting, in which case it shall be approved by way of a decision. the antarctic treaty consultative meeting may seek the advice of the committee of environmental protection on such a proposal, as appropriate.3. special circumstances and criteria, such as: the fact that the responsible operator was an operator of the party seeking reimbursement; the identity of the responsible operator remaining unknown or not subject to the provisions of this annex; the unforeseen
