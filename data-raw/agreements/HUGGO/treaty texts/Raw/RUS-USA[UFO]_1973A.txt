AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS RELATING TO
FISHING OPERATIONS IN THE NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC
OCEAN
The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
Being mutually concerned that fishing operations in the northeastern Pacific
Ocean carried on by the fishermen of the two countries be conducted with due
consideration for the interests of both Parties,
Considering it desirable to take measures for the prevention of damage to the
fishing gear used by the fishermen of both countries,
Considering it desirable also to provide for appropriate contacts between
representatives of both Parties on questions related to the conduct of the fisheries,
Have agreed on the following measures:
1. The Parties will take measures to emphasize to their officials, fishing
industry organizations and fishermen the importance of special efforts to protect
fishing gear belonging to each side from damage by vessels and fishing gear of the
other side, when conducting fishing operations in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.
Each party will encourage the use by its officials, fishing industry organizations and
fishermen of devices, detectable both day and night, to mark the location of fixed
fishing gear. The Parties will inform each other of the devices and the manner in
which they are used. Each Party will promote the exercise of necessary caution on
the part of persons responsible for the operation of vessels and gear so as to aid to
the maximum extent practicable in timely detection of the vessels and gear of the
other Party and prevention of damage thereto.
2. In the waters seaward of the nine-mile zone contiguous to the territorial sea
of the United States fishing operations using mobile fishing gear will not be
conducted during the periods specified below in the six areas off Kodiak Island
bounded respectively by straight lines connecting in each of the following groups
the coordinates in the order listed:

3. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply to small shrimp craft
conducting trawling operations in such a way as not to interfere with fixed gear in
the above areas, or to United States vessels engaged in scallop fishing operations.
4. It is understood that the right of fishermen of the Soviet Union to fish does
not extend to waters within 12 nautical miles seaward from the baseline from which
the territorial sea of the United States is measured.
5. It is understood that some vessels are likely to operate fixed gear outside the
areas described in paragraph 2. Each Party will take special measures to promote
the use by persons operating such vessels of means of marking such gear in addition
to those ordinarily used. In order to inform the trawling fleet of the locations of
such fixed gear, officials of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, or of the
United States National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Chief of the Joint
Expedition of the Main Administration of DALRYBA will, if the necessity arises,
transmit timely information to each other on the location of such vessels and fishing
gear. Arrangements for such transmissions, including the designation of working
frequencies and times of transmission, will be agreed upon between the abovementioned
officials. The persons responsible for the operation of trawlers will be
given specific instructions regarding extraordinary precautionary measures to be
taken when operating in the vicinity of fixed gear the positions of which have been
reported, or other fixed gear which is detected.
6. The United States will carry out further research designed to develop a more
effective and practical method for marking the location of fixed gear. Soviet
technicians will cooperate with those of the United States in this effort, particularly
in connection with the testing of the effectiveness of new gear markers.
7. This Agreement is without prejudice to the views and rights of either Party
with respect to the conduct of fishing operations on the high seas.
8. The parties consider it desirable to expand contacts between government
officials, representatives of the fishing industry, and fishery scientific workers of
both countries for the discussion of questions of mutual interest and the achievement
of greater mutual understanding.
9. This Agreement shall replace the Agreement of December 14, 1 1964 between
the two Governments relating to fishing operations in the northeastern Pacific
Ocean, as amended by the Agreements of January 31, 1969, 2 and of February 12,
1971,3 the latter having been extended by an exchange of notes dated December 31,
1972. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of two years. At the request
of either Government, representatives of the two Governments will meet at a
mutually convenient time with a view to modifying the present Agreement. In any
event, representatives of the two Governments will meet at a mutually convenient
time prior to the expiration of the period of validity of this Agreement to review its
operation and to decide on future arrangements.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorized for this purpose,
have signed this Agreement
DONE at Moscow, February 21, 1973, in duplicate, in the English and Russian
languages, both texts being equally authentic.
