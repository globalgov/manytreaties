Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark together with the
Home Government of the Faroe Islands, on the one hand, and the Government of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on the other hand,
relating to Maritime Delimitation in the Area between the Faroe Islands and the
United Kingdom,
18 May 1999
The Government of the Kingdom of Denmark together with the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, on
the one hand, and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on the other hand,
("the Parties"),
Having agreed to delimit the continental shelf in the area between the Faroe Islands and the United
Kingdom within 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the territorial sea of each Party is measured ("the
Area"),
Having further agreed to delimit the waters superajacent to the continental shelf in part of the Area and to
establish a special regime for the remaining part ("the Special Area"),
HAVE AGREED as follows:
Article 1
1. The continental shelf boundary in the Area shall be a series of geodetic lines joining, in the order specified,
the points listed in Schedule A to this Agreement.
2. By way of illustration, the boundary line and the points listed in Schedule A have been drawn on chart A
annexed to this Agreement.
3. In the north-east, the termination point of the boundary line is the equidistant tripoint between the Faroe
Islands, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the south-west, the termination point of the boundary line is a point
situated 200 nautical miles calculated from the territorial sea basepoints on Mykinesholmur and on St. Kilda,
respectively.
Article 2
1. If an accumulation of petroleum or any other mineral deposit is found in or on the continental shelf of one
of the Parties and the other Party is of the opinion that the accumulation or deposit extends onto its continental shelf,
the latter Party may, by presenting the evidence upon which the opinion is based, submit this to the first-mentioned
Party.
2. If such an opinion is submitted, the Parties shall initiate discussions on the extent of the accumulation or
deposit and the possibility for exploitation. At these discussions, the Party initiating them shall support its opinion
by evidence from geophysical data and geological data, including in due course drilling data, and both Parties shall
use their best efforts to ensure that all relevant information is made available for the purposes of the discussions. If
it is established during these discussions that the accumulation or deposit extends onto the continental shelf of both
Parties and also that the minerals in the continental shelf of the one Party can be exploited wholly or in part from the
continental shelf of the other Party or that the exploitation of the minerals in the continental shelf of the one Party
would affect the possibility of exploitation of the minerals in the continental shelf of the other Party, agreement shall
be reached at the request of one of the Parties particularly as to the manner in which any such accumulation or
deposit shall be most effectively exploited and the proceeds relating thereto shall be apportioned.
3. The Parties shall make every effort to resolve any disagreement as rapidly as possible. If, however, the
Parties fail to agree during the discussions, they shall jointly consider all of the options for resolving the impasse
including inviting the opinion of independent experts.
Article 3
1. The boundary which separates the respective fishing zones of the Parties in the Area and within which the
Parties exercise, or will exercise, in addition to those pertaining to the continental shelf, any sovereign rights or
jurisdiction which are conferred on coastal States by international law, shall be geodetic lines joining, in the order
specified, the points listed as points A to L and as points R to T in Schedule B to this Agreement.
2. By way of illustration, the boundary line and the points listed in Schedule B have been drawn on chart B
annexed to this Agreement.
Article 4
1. In the area between points L and R listed in Schedule B, the Special Area, each Party is entitled to exercise
its jurisdiction and rights in accordance with the provisions of articles 5, 6 and 7.
2. The Special Area is described by the coordinates in Schedule C to this Agreement and, by way of
illustration, drawn on chart C annexed to this Agreement.
Article 5
With regard to fisheries jurisdiction and rights in the Special Area, each Party shall continue as heretofore:
(a) To apply the relevant rules and regulations applicable within its zone of fisheries jurisdiction
concerning the management, including the issuing of fishing licences, and conduct of fisheries;
(b) To refrain from inspection and control of fishing vessels which operate in the Special Area solely
under a licence issued by the other Party;
(c) To refrain from any action that would disregard or infringe upon the exercise of fisheries
jurisdiction by the other Party or the conduct of fisheries under licence issued by the other Party.
Article 6
With regard to the exercise of its continental shelf jurisdiction and rights in the Special Area, each Party
shall:
(a) Take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate pollution from its offshore activities, in
accordance with the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East
Atlantic, done at Paris on 22 September 1992, particularly annex III thereof as amended from
time to time;
(b) Take due account of the interest of the other Party in maintaining its fishing possibilities;
(c) Take measures to avoid unnecessary interference with fishing carried out under
licence issued by the other Party;
(d) Ensure that the other Party is given timely notification concerning any activity which may have a
negative impact upon the marine environment or the fisheries under licence issued by the other
Party, if the Party either has authorized that activity or has been notified of it;
(e) Encourage its national bodies or funds that compensate fishing vessels for damage arising from
such activities to extend such compensation schemes to fishing vessels registered in the other
Party;
(f) Encourage, and as soon as practicable ensure, that exploration or production licensees have
suitable coordination between, on the one hand, the seismic survey and supply vessel owners they
employ and their masters and, on the other hand, the authorities or organizations which represent
the fishing industry of the other Party, in order to promote good working relationships between the
various parties.
Article 7
With regard to the exercise in the Special Area of jurisdiction and rights which are conferred on coastal
States by international law, other than such jurisdiction or rights that follow directly from continental shelf or
fisheries jurisdiction, each Party shall refrain from exercising such jurisdiction or rights without the agreement of the
other Party and shall cooperate with the other Party, notably on measures to protect the marine environment.
Article 8
Each Party may through the diplomatic channel call for consultations with the other Party with a view to
reaching agreement on any issue pertaining to articles 5, 6 and 7 of this Agreement. Such consultations shall be held
not later than sixty days after receipt of the request.
Article 9
When in the present Agreement reference is made to "licence issued by the other Party" this wording shall
in the case of the United Kingdom be understood to include licences issued by the United Kingdom, another State
member of the European Community or the European Commission on behalf of the European Community.
Article 10
This Agreement shall be without prejudice to any claim of either Party outside the Area.
Article 11
1. Each Party shall notify the other of the completion of its internal procedures required to enable this
Agreement to enter into force.
2. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the later of these notifications.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorized thereto by their respective Governments,
have signed this Agreement.
