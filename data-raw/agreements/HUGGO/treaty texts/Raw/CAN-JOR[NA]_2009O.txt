Customs Procedures

 

Section I - Certification of Origin

 

Article 5-1: Certificate of Origin

1. The Parties shall establish, by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, a Certificate of Origin for the purpose of certifying that a good being exported from the territory of a Party into the territory of the other Party qualifies as an originating good. The Certificate of Origin may thereafter be modified as the Parties may agree.

2. Each Party shall provide that the Certificate of Origin may be presented in Arabic, English or French. Each Party may nevertheless require the importer to submit a translation of the Certificate of Origin into a language required by its domestic law.

3. Each Party shall:

(a) require an exporter in its territory to complete and sign a Certificate of Origin for any exportation of a good for which an importer may claim preferential tariff treatment upon importation of the good into the territory of the other Party; and

(b) provide that where an exporter in its territory is not the producer of the good, the exporter may complete and sign a Certificate of Origin on the basis of:

(i) its knowledge of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, based on information in the exporter’s possession,

(ii) its reasonable reliance on the producer’s written representation that the good qualifies as an originating good, or

(iii) a completed and signed Certificate of Origin for the good voluntarily provided to the exporter by the producer.

4. Each Party shall apply a Certificate of Origin to a single importation of one or more goods into its territory.

5. The Parties shall endeavour to modify the Certificate of Origin so that it may be used for multiple importations of identical goods into a Party’s territory when these importations are made by the same importer and occur within a specified period, not exceeding 12 months.

6. When a Certificate of Origin is established by the Parties under paragraph 1, each Party shall apply the Certificate of Origin to a single importation of goods as described in paragraph 4 and to multiple importations as described in paragraph 5.

Article 5-2: Obligations Regarding Importations

1. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each Party shall require an importer in its territory that claims preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party to:

(a) make a written declaration, based on a Certificate of Origin, that the good qualifies as an originating good;

(b) have the Certificate of Origin in its possession at the time the declaration is made;

(c) provide, on the request of that Party’s customs administration, the Certificate of Origin; and

(d) promptly make a corrected declaration in a manner required by its customs administration and pay any duties owing where the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct.

2. Each Party shall provide that, where an importer in its territory claims preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party:

(a) the Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good if the importer fails to comply with any requirement under this Chapter; and

(b) the importer shall not be subject to penalties for the making of an incorrect declaration, if it voluntarily makes a corrected declaration pursuant to subparagraph 1(d).

3. Each Party shall provide that, where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the territory of that Party but no claim for preferential tariff treatment was made at that time, the importer of the good may, within 60 days or for such a longer period specified by the importing Party’s law after the date on which the good was imported, apply for a refund, of any excess duties paid as a result of the good not having been accorded preferential tariff treatment, on presentation of:

(a) a written declaration that the good qualified as an originating good at the time of importation;

(b) a copy of the Certificate of Origin; and

(c) such other documentation relating to the importation of the good as that Party may require.

(b) a non-commercial importation of a good whose customs value does not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in the Party’s currency, or such higher amount as it may establish; or

(c) an importation of a good for which the Party into whose territory the good is imported has waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin, provided that the importation does not form part of a series of importations that the importing Party reasonably considers to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the certification requirements of Articles 5-1 and 5-2.

Article 5-4: Obligations Regarding Exportations

1. Each Party shall provide that:

(a) an exporter in its territory, or a producer in its territory that has provided a Certificate of Origin to that exporter in accordance with item (iii) of subparagraph 3(b) of Article 5-1, shall provide the Certificate of Origin to its customs administration on its request;

(b) where an exporter or a producer in its territory has provided a Certificate of Origin and has reason to believe that the Certificate of Origin contains or is based on incorrect information, the exporter or producer shall promptly notify in writing any change that could affect the accuracy or validity of the Certificate of Origin to every person to whom the exporter or producer has provided the Certificate of Origin; and

(c) a false certification by an exporter or a producer in its territory that a good to be exported to the territory of the other Party is originating shall be subject to penalties equivalent to those that would apply to an importer in its territory that makes a false statement or representation in connection with an importation, with appropriate modifications.

(a) verification letters that request information from the exporter or producer of the good in the territory of the other Party;

(b) written questionnaires to the exporter or producer of the good in the territory of the other Party;

(c) visits to the premises of an exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party to review the records referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 5-5 and observe the facilities used in the production of the good; or

(d) any other method of communication customarily used by the competent authority of the Party conducting the verification.

2. Each Party shall provide that the competent authority of a Party may, for purposes of verifying the origin of a good, request that the importer of the good voluntarily obtain and supply written information voluntarily provided by the exporter or producer of the good in the territory of the other Party, provided that the failure or refusal of the importer to obtain and supply such information will not be considered as a failure of the exporter or producer to supply the information or as a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment.

3. Each Party shall allow an exporter or producer who receives a verification letter or a questionnaire pursuant to sub paragraphs 1(a) and (b) no less than 30 days to provide the information and documentation required or the completed questionnaire. During that period, the importing Party shall allow the exporter or producer to submit to it a written request for a single extension of this deadline for a period not exceeding 30 days.

4. Where an exporter or producer fails to provide the information and documentation required by a verification letter or fails to return a duly completed questionnaire within the period or extension set out in paragraph 3, the importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good in question pursuant to the procedures set out in paragraphs 15 and 16.

8. The Party whose competent authority receives notification pursuant to item(ii) of subparagraph 5(a) may, within 15 days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for no more than 60 days from the date of such receipt or for such longer period as the Parties may agree.

9. Each Party shall provide that, where the exporter or producer receives notification pursuant to to item (i) of subparagraph 5(a) the exporter or producer may, on a single occasion, within 15 days of receipt of the notification, request the postponement of the proposed verification visit for a period no more than 60 days from the date of such receipt or for such longer period as agreed to by the notifying Party.

10. A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good based solely on the postponement of a verification visit pursuant to paragraphs 8 or 9.

11. A Party shall permit an exporter or a producer whose good is the subject of a verification visit by the other Party to designate two observers to be present during the visit, provided that:

(a) the observers shall only participate as such; and

12. Where a Party conducts a verification of origin involving a value test, “de minimis” calculation or any other provision in Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) to which Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may be relevant, it shall apply such principles as are applicable in the territory of the other Party.

13. Where the producer of a good calculates the net cost of the good as set out in Article 4-2 of Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), the importing Party shall not verify, during the fiscal period over which the net cost is being calculated, whether the good satisfies the value test.

14. The Party conducting a verification shall provide the exporter or producer whose good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, including findings of fact and the legal basis for the determination.

15. Where a Party determines as a result of an origin verification that the good that is the subject of the verification does not qualify as an originating good, the Party shall include in its written determination provided for under paragraph 14 a written notice of intent to deny preferential tariff treatment of the good.

16. A written notice of intent to deny preferential tariff treatment issued pursuant to paragraph 15 shall provide for no less than 30 days during which the exporter or producer of the good may provide, with regard to that determination, written comments or additional information that will be taken into account by the Party prior to completing the verification.

17. Where verifications by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or a producer of false or unsupported representations that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), in accordance with the Party’s domestic law.

Where a Party conducts a verification pursuant to paragraph 18, the Party may consider the material to be non-originating in determining whether the good is an originating good where the producer or supplier of that material does not allow the Party access to information required to make a determination of whether the material is an originating material by the following or other means:

(a) denial of access to its records;

(b) failure to respond to a verification questionnaire or letter; or

(c) refusal to consent to a verification visit to a verification visit within 30 days of receipt of the notification pursuant to paragraph 5.

4. Each Party shall facilitate and simplify its processes and procedures for the release of low-risk goods, and shall improve controls on the release of high-risk goods. For these purposes, each Party shall base its examination and release procedures and its post-entry verification procedures on risk management principles, rather than examining each shipment offered for entry in a comprehensive manner for compliance with all import requirements. This shall not prevent a Party from conducting quality control and compliance reviews, which may require more extensive examinations.

5. Each Party shall ensure that the procedures and activities of its agencies that have requirements on the import or export of goods, and are maintained either by themselves or on their behalf by its competent authority, are coordinated to facilitate trade. To this end, each Party shall take steps to harmonize the data requirements of such agencies with the objective of allowing importers and exporters to present all required data to only one border agency.

6. In its procedures for the clearance of express consignments, each Party shall apply, to the extent possible, the World Customs Organization Guidelines for the Immediate Release of Consignments by Customs.

7. Each Party shall introduce or maintain simplified clearance procedures for the entry of goods that are low in value and for which the revenue associated with such imports is not considered significant by the Party maintaining such expedited procedures.

8. The Parties shall endeavour to achieve common processes and simplification of the information necessary for the release of goods, applying, when appropriate, existing international standards. With this objective, the Parties shall also endeavour to establish a means of providing for the electronic exchange of information between competent authorities and the importers, exporters, their agents or their representatives, for the purpose of encouraging rapid release procedures. For the purpose of this Article, each Party shall use formats based on international standards for the electronic exchange of information, and shall also take into account, to the extent possible, the World Customs Organization Recommendations “Concerning the Use of UN/EDIFACT Rules for Electronic Data Interchange” and “Concerning the Use of Codes for the Representation of Data Elements”. This shall not preclude the use of additional electronic data transmission standards.

9. Each Party shall, to the extent possible, establish means of consultation with its trade and business communities to promote greater cooperation and the exchange of electronic information.

10. Subject to Chapter 5 (Customs Procedures), a Party shall issue a written ruling prior to an importation in response to a written request by an importer in its territory, exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party, or their respective representatives. These rulings shall be issued for tariff classification or rate of customs duty, except any form of surtax or surcharge, applicable upon importation.

11. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures for the issuance of rulings referred to in paragraph 10. In accordance with these procedures, a Party may, at any time, modify or revoke a ruling:

(a) after notification to the person that requested the ruling and without retroactive application; or

(b) without notification and with retroactive application in circumstances where inaccurate or false information was provided.

12. The rulings referred to in paragraph 10 shall be as detailed as the nature of the request and the details provided by the person requesting the ruling permit. When a Party determines that a request for a ruling is incomplete, it may request additional information, including, where appropriate, a sample of the goods or materials in question from the person requesting the ruling. A Party shall issue a ruling within 120 days after it has received all the information it considers necessary to issue the ruling. A ruling shall be binding upon the Party that issued the ruling at the time the goods are actually imported provided that the facts and circumstances that were the basis for the issuance of the ruling remain in effect.

13. Each Party shall ensure that any administrative action or official decision taken in respect of the import or export of goods is reviewable promptly by judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or through administrative procedures. Such tribunal or official acting pursuant to such administrative procedures shall be independent of the official or office issuing the decision and shall have the competence to maintain, modify or reverse the determination, in accordance with the Party’s domestic law. Each Party shall provide for an administrative level of appeal or review, independent of the official or, where applicable, the office responsible for the original action or decision, before requiring a person to seek redress at a more formal or judicial level.

14. Each Party shall publish or otherwise make available, including through electronic means, all their legislation, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings or policies of general application relating to its requirements for imported or exported goods. Each Party shall also make available notices of an administrative nature, such as general agency requirements and entry procedures, hours of operation and points of contacts for information enquiries.

15. Each Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, treat as strictly confidential all business information obtained pursuant to this Chapter that is by its nature confidential or that is provided on a confidential basis.

Article 6-3: Cooperation

1. The Parties recognize that technical cooperation is fundamental to facilitating compliance with the obligations set forth in this Agreement and for reaching a better degree of trade facilitation.

The Parties shall review relevant international initiatives on trade facilitation, including the Compendium of Trade Facilitation Recommendations, developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, to identify areas where further joint action would facilitate trade between the Parties and promote shared multilateral objectives.
