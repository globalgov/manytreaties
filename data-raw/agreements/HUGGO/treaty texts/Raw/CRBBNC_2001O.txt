(a) a government practice involves direct transfer of funds (e.g., grants, loans and equity infusion) or potential direct transfer of funds or liabilities (e.g., loan guarantees);

(b) government revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not collected (e.g., fiscal incentives, such as tax credits);

(c) a government purchases goods or provides goods or services other than general infrastructure;
(d) a government makes payments to a funding mechanism, or directs or entrusts to a private body the conduct of activities mentioned in sub- Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) which are normally conducted by governments;

(e) there is any form of income or price support, and a benefit is thereby conferred.

Article 97. Types of Subsidies
1. A subsidy within the meaning of Article 96 shall be categorised as follows:

(a) a prohibited subsidy;

(b) a subsidy which:
(i) causes injury to a domestic industry; or

(ii) results in nullification or impairment of benefits accruing directly or indirectly to any Member Siate; or

(iii) seriously prejudices the interests of any Member State; or (co) a subsidy which causes serious adverse effects to a domestic industry of any Member State such as to cause damage which would be difficult to repair:

Provided that the subsidy is specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries within the jurisdiction of the granting Member State.

2. For the purpose of this Chapter a determination of whether a subsidy as defined in Article 92 is specific shall be governed by the following:

(a) in order to determine whether a subsidy referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries (referred to in this Part as "certain enterprises") within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, the following criteria shall apply:
 (i) where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, explicitly limits access to a subsidy to certain enterprises, such a subsidy shall be specific;

(ii) where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, specificity shall not exist, provided that the eligibility is automatic and that such criteria and conditions are strictly adhered to. The criteria or conditions must be clearly spelled out in law, regulation, or other official document, so as to be capable of verification;
(iii) if, notwithstanding any appearance of non-specificity resulting from the application of the principles laid down in sub-sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii), there are reasons to believe that the subsidy may in fact be specific, other factors may be considered. Such factors are: use of a subsidy programme by a limited number of certain enterprises, predominant use of certain enterprises, the granting of disproportionately large amounts of subsidy to certain enterprises, and the manner in which discretion has been exercised by the granting authority in the decision to grant a subsidy. in applying this sub-paragraph, account shall be taken of the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, as well as of the length of time during which the subsidy programme has been in operation;

(b) a subsidy which is limited to certain enterprises located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the granting authority shail be specific. It is understood that the setting or change of generally applicable tax rates by all levels of government entitled to do so shall not be deemed to be a specific subsidy for the purposes of this Part;

(c) any subsidy falling under the provisions of Article 99 shall be deemed to be specific;

(d) any determination of specificity under the provisions of this Article shall be clearly substantiated on the basis of positive evidence.

Article 98. Entitlement to Take Action Against Subsidised Products

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, a Member State shall not take definitive action against products which are believed to be benefiting from subsidies referred to in Article 97 if the Member State aggrieved thereby has not:

(a) promulgated legisiation to permit the introduction of counter measures or countervailing duties against subsidised imports;

(b) consulted with the Member State which is alleged to have introduced or to be maintaining subsidies identified in Article 97;

(c) notified COTED of the alleged subsidisation based on preliminary investigations and failure of consultations; and

(d) received authorisation from COTED to introduce countervailing duties or countermeasures as a result of a definitive determination of the existence of prohibited subsidies which cause nullification, impairment, serious Prejudice or adverse effects caused by subsidisation.

2. Whenever the results of an investigation by COTED prove that the alleged subsidy is nota prohibited subsidy, any provisional countervailing measures which might have been imposed shall be promptly withdrawn and any bond or deposit which might have been effected, released or refunded, as the case may be. If the provisional measures referred to in this paragraph have materially retarded the exports of the Member State which was wrongfully alleged to have introduced or maintained prohibited subsidies, COTED shall, upon application from such a Member State, assess the effects of the provisionally applied measures and determine the nature and extent of compensation which is warranted and recommend compensation in accordance with its assessment.

3. From the date of entry into force of this Treaty until the expiration of the dates mentioned in paragraph 1, no provisional measures shall be imposed where it has been determined by preliminary investigations that prohibited subsidies are maintained.

Article 126. Determination of Dumping
Article 126. Determination of Dumping
1. For the purpose of this Part, a product is to be considered to be a dumped import where it is introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value if the export Price of the product exported from one Member state to another Member State is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting Member Siate.

1. For the purpose of this Part, a product is to be considered to be a dumped import where it is introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value if the export Price of the product exported from one Member state to another Member State is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting Member Siate.

2. When there are no Sales of the like product in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country or when, because of the particular market situation or the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country, such sales do not permit a Proper comparison, the margin of dumping shall be determined by comparison with a comparable Price of the like product when exported to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative, or with the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits.

2. When there are no Sales of the like product in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country or when, because of the particular market situation or the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country, such sales do not permit a Proper comparison, the margin of dumping shall be determined by comparison with a comparable Price of the like product when exported to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative, or with the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits.

3. In cases where there is no export price or where it appears to the authorities concemed that the export price is unreliable because of association or a compensatory arrangement beiween the exporter and importer or a third party, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported products are first resold to an independent buyer, or if the products are not resold to an independent buyer, or not resold in the condition as imported, on such reasonable basis as the authorities may determine.

3. In cases where there is no export price or where it appears to the authorities concemed that the export price is unreliable because of association or a compensatory arrangement beiween the exporter and importer or a third party, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported products are first resold to an independent buyer, or if the products are not resold to an independent buyer, or not resold in the condition as imported, on such reasonable basis as the authorities may determine.

4. A fair comparison shail be made between the export price and the normal value. This comparison shail be made at the same level of trade, normally at the ex-factory level, and in respect of sales made at as nearly as possible the same time. Due allowance shail be made in each case, on its merits, for differences which affect price comparability, including differences in conditions and terms of sale, taxation, levels of trade, quantities, physical characteristics, and any other differences which are also demonstrated to affect price comparability. In the cases referred to in paragraph 3, allowances for costs, including duties and taxes incurred between importation and resale, and for profits accruing, should also be made. If in these cases price comparability has been affected, the authorities shall establish the normal value at a level of trade equivalent to the level of trade of the constructed export price, or shall make due allowance as warranted under this paragraph. The authorities shall indicate to the parties in question what information is necessary to ensure a fair comparison and shail not impose an unreasonable burden of proof on those parties.

5. In the case where products are not imported directly from the country of origin but are exported to the importing Member from an intermediate country, the price at which the products are sold from the country of export to the importing Member shall normally be compared with the comparable price in the country of export. However, comparison may be made with the price in the country of origin, if, for example, the products are merely transshipped through the country of export, or such products are not produced in the country of export, or there is no comparable price for them in the country of export.
