agreement on the protection and sustainable development of the prespa park areasource: the ministries of the environment of the three states sharing the prespa lakes area and the european union, hereinafter referred to as 'the parties',mindful of the declaration of the prime ministers of the three states of 2 february 2000 on the creation of the prespa park and the environmental protection and sustainable development of the prespa lakes and their surroundings,recalling the joint statement of the prime ministers of the three states sharing the prespa lakes basin of 27 november 2009 at pyli,considering that the prespa lakes and their surrounding basin are a unique natural area whose geomorphological, ecological, biodiversity and cultural significance is of international importance, as a vital habitat for the conservation of numerous rare and/or endemic fauna and flora species, as a nesting place of globally threatened birds, and as a depository of significant archaeological and traditional heritage,recognising their common responsibility for the conservation of the prespa lakes basin ecosystem and its components as well as for its natural beauty, as a basis for the economic and social well-being of its inhabitants and for creating economic development opportunities (including agriculture, fisheries and tourism),convinced that only through adopting a holistic approach at the basin level can they ensure and maintain the biodiversity, the key functions and the human benefits of the prespa lakes basin,aware that individual actions of countries are not sufficient to bring about conservation of the ecosystems of prespa and its cultural heritage, while improving the standard of living of its inhabitants,wishing to enhance cooperation among competent authorities and stakeholders in the three states in order to maintain and protect the unique ecological values of the prespa lakes basin and prevent and/or reverse the causes of its habitat degradation, as requested by the declaration of the prime ministers of 2 february 2000,resolved to explore appropriate management methods for the sustainable use and protection of the prespa lakes water and freshwater ecosystems, as requested by the declaration of the prime ministers of 2 february 2000, and in accordance with the requirements of the eu water framework directive 2000/60/ec and related directives,aware of the long history of human use of the area and the compatibility of traditional uses with nature conservation,confirming their commitment to the sustainable development of the prespa lakes basin that can be brought about in a coherent way through transboundary cooperation, in accordance with the principles of the european union's integration process,taking note of the drin dialogue initiated in 2009 amongst competent authorities and stakeholders towards the development of a shared vision for the sustainable management of the drin basin and the promotion of transboundary cooperation,bearing in mind the relevant provisions of international legal instruments in force in the field of environmental protection to which they are parties or signatories,recalling the bilateral agreements in force between the parties concerning cooperation in the field of environmental protection and sustainable development,bearing in mind that one of the parties is a member state of the european union, one is a candidate country for eu membership and one is potential candidate country for eu membership and that the latter two have also concluded a stabilisation and association agreement with the eu,recognising the differentiated but complementary capacity of governmental and non-governmental organisations in the three state parties with respect to the conservation and management of the prespa area,taking into account the experience gained from the trilateral cooperation in the framework of the prespa park since 2000 through the operation of the interim coordination committee and its secretariat,taking into account the strategic action plan for the sustainable development of the prespa park elaborated within the framework of the interim coordination committee and its secretariat,have agreed as follows:part onegeneral provisions ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of this agreement:- the 'prespa park area' (the 'area') is the geographical area in the territory
