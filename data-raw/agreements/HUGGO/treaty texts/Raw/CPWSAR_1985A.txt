waste sites: sites on which waste is separated from the groundwater table by sufficient semi permeable soil (maximum permeability 10-3cm sec -1).1.3 class 3 - unacceptable sites: sites where there is no attenuation zone at all due to the solid waste being in direct contact with the groundwater table.2.0 waste acceptance criteria2.1 as a general rule, the following chemical criteria shall apply for
