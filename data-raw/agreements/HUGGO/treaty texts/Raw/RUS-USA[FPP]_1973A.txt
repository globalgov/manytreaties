STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS ON CERTAIN
FISHERIES PROBLEMS IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF
THE PACIFIC OCEAN OFF THE COAST OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA
The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
Being mutually interested in having the fisheries in the northeastern part of the
Pacific Ocean off the coast of the United States conducted with due attention to
their respective interests, and
Considering it desirable that the fisheries in the said area be conducted with
due regard to the conservation of fish stocks, and that measures be taken to prevent
damage to the fishing gear used by fishermen of the two countries,
Have agreed on the following:
1. The Government of the United States of America and the Government of
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consider it desirable to expand research
pertaining to the species of fish of interest to both parties, on a national basis as

facilitate entry into appropriate ports for research vessels of the other Government
engaged in joint research. Fishery research vessels of the Soviet Union with
participating scientists of the United States on board may conduct cooperative
research within the nine-mile zone contiguous to the territorial sea of the United

in fishing for hake of bottom trawls with a mesh size in any of the parts no less than
60 to 70 millimeters or 2.4 to 2.8 inches, stretched mesh, including one knot (two
bars). It is agreed that there will be no marked change in the manner in which

Information as to the opening dates of the halibut fishing season shall be provided
no less than one month in advance to the Government of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics by the Government of the United States of America.
8. Each Government shall, within the scope of its domestic laws and regula
tions, facilitate entry into appropriate ports for fishing vessels, fishery research
vessels, and fishery support vessels. The Government of the United States of
America will take appropriate measures to ensure the following:
a. The entry of Soviet fishing, fishery research, and fishery support vessels into
the ports of Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Honolulu, Hawaii, Entry
into these three ports shall be permitted subject to four days' advance notice to the
appropriate authority. In addition, special provisions shall be made when necessary
regarding the entry into these and certain other U.S. ports of Soviet research vessels
which are engaged in mutually agreed research programs.
b. The Government of the United States at its Embassy in Moscow will accept
crew lists in application for visas valid for a period of six months and for multiple
entries into United States ports pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. Such
a crew list shall be submitted at least 21 days prior to the first entry of a vessel into
a port of the United States. Submission of an amended (supplemental) crew list
subsequent to departure of a vessel from Soviet ports will also be subject to the
provisions of this subparagraph, provided that visas issued thereunder shall only be
valid for six months from the date of issuance of the original crew list visa.
Notification of entry under subparagraph a of this paragraph shall specify whether
shore leave is requested under such a multiple entry visa.
c. Entry of all vessels into the ports referred to in subparagraph a of this
paragraph will be to replenish ship stores or fresh water, obtain bunkers, provide
rest for or make changes in personnel of such vessels, and obtain minor repairs and
other services normally provided in such ports, all in accordance with applicable
rules and regulations.
d. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, it is understood that the entry
of Soviet vessels into any United States port is subject to. the applicable laws and
regulations of the United States.
e. Each of the above provisions of this paragraph may be modified by mutual
consent at any time.
9. Each Government will take appropriate measures with regard to areas of
heavy concentration of fishing operations of both countries directed at prevention
of damage to fishing gear, including:
a. Measures leading to improvement of the means for marking fixed fishing gear
and for reciprocal notification of areas in which fixed gear is concentrated;
b. Measures to ensure that fixed gear is set with due regard for the operation of
mobile gears;
c. Measures to ensure that vessels operating with mobile gear will pass clearly
marked fixed gear at a distance of not less than 400 meters from the nearest
marker.
10. Both Governments will take appropriate measures to ensure that except in
cases offeree majeure no vessel shall dump in the sea any article or substance which
may interfere with fishing or obstruct or cause damage to fish, fishing gear, fishing
vessels, or marine mammals. United States fishery authorities and Soviet fishing
fleet commanders will inform each other of the location of items of fishing gear or
other materials lost overboard which constitute a danger to fishing operations on
common fishing grounds.
11. Both Governments consider it useful to arrange:
a. That representatives of the fishing fleets of the United States and the Soviet
Union meet at least twice each fishing session in the Alaska area and at least
twice each fishing season in the California, Oregon, and Washington area. At
least one meeting in each area will be at a site to be selected by the appropriate
Regional Director of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service and at least
one meeting in each area at a site to be selected by the Soviet Fleet Commander;
b. That each side will inform the other side, at least one month before the visit, of
subjects it wishes to discuss. Those participating shall prepare a brief report of
each visit and submit it to the appropriate authorities of the two Governments.
These visits will be to exchange information and discuss actual or potential
problems concerning the fishing grounds, questions relating to the operations
of fishing fleets, and questions arising out of the application of the provisions
of this Agreement;
c. In addition, mutual visits of representatives of fishermen's organizations of the
two countries on vessels operating in the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean.
Such visits may be arranged on mutually agreed terms determined in each
particular case by the appropriate Regional Director of the U.S. National
Marine Fisheries Service and the Chief of the Joint Expedition of the Main
Administration of DALRYBA.
12. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as prejudicing the views of
either Government with regard to freedom of fishing on the high seas or to
traditional fisheries.
13. This Agreement shall replace the Agreement of February 13, 1967,'
between the two Governments on certain fishery problems in the northeastern
Pacific Ocean, as extended December 18, 1967, 2 and as amended and extended by
the Agreements of January 31, 1969,3 and of February 12, 1971,4 which in turn was
extended by an exchange of notes dated December 31, 1972. This Agreement shall
remain in effect for a period of two years. At the request of either Government,
representatives of the two Governments will meet at a mutually convenient time
with a view to modifying the present Agreement. In any event, representatives of
the two Governments will meet at a mutually convenient time prior to the expiration
of the period of validity of this Agreement to review its operation and to decide on
future arrangements. Notwithstanding the above, at any time subsequent to one
year after signature, either Government may communicate to the other Government
its intention to denounce this Agreement, in which case this Agreement shall
terminate one month from the date of the communication. As soon as possible after
receipt of such communication, representatives of the two Governments will meet
to discuss possible future arrangements.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorized for this purpose,
have signed this Agreement.
