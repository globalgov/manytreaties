nairobi international convention on the removal of wreckssource: preamblethe states parties to the present convention,conscious of the fact that wrecks, if not removed, may pose a hazard to navigation or the marine environment,convinced of the need to adopt uniform international rules and procedures to ensure the prompt and effective removal of wrecks and payment of compensation for the costs therein involved,noting that many wrecks may be located in states' territory, including the territorial sea,recognizing the benefits to be gained through uniformity in legal regimes governing responsibility and liability for removal of hazardous wrecks,bearing in mind the importance of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, done at montego bay on 10 december 1982, and of the customary international law of the sea, and the consequent need to implement the present convention in accordance with such provisions,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of this convention:1 "convention area" means the exclusive economic zone of a state party, established in accordance with international law or, if a state party has not established such a zone, an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea of that state determined by that state in accordance with international law and extending not more than 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured.2 "ship" means a seagoing vessel of any type whatsoever and includes hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles, floating craft and floating platforms, except when such platforms are on location engaged in the exploration, exploitation or production of seabed mineral resources.3 "maritime casualty" means a collision of ships, stranding or other incident of navigation, or other occurrence on board a ship or external to it, resulting in material damage or imminent threat of material damage to a ship or its cargo.4 "wreck", following upon a maritime casualty, means:(a) a sunken or stranded ship; or(b) any part of a sunken or stranded ship, including any object that is or has been on board such a ship; or(c) any object that is lost at sea from a ship and that is stranded, sunken or adrift at sea; or(d) a ship that is about, or may reasonably be expected, to sink or to strand, where effective measures to assist the ship or any property in danger are not already being taken.5 "hazard" means any condition or threat that:(a) poses a danger or impediment to navigation; or(b) may reasonably be expected to result in major harmful consequences to the marine environment, or damage to the coastline or related interests of one or more states.6 "related interests" means the interests of a coastal state directly affected or threatened by a wreck, such as:(a) maritime coastal, port and estuarine activities, including fisheries activities, constituting an essential means of livelihood of the persons concerned;(b) tourist attractions and other economic interests of the area concerned;(c) the health of the coastal population and the wellbeing of the area concerned, including conservation of marine living resources and of wildlife; and(d) offshore and underwater infrastructure.7 "removal" means any form of prevention, mitigation or elimination of the hazard created by a wreck. "remove", "removed" and "removing" shall be construed accordingly.8 "registered owner" means the person or persons registered as the owner of the ship or, in the absence of registration, the person or

"registered owner" shall mean such company.9 "operator of the ship" means the owner of the ship or any other organization or person such as the manager, or the bareboat charterer, who has assumed the

measures shall not go beyond what is reasonably necessary to remove a wreck which poses a hazard and shall cease as soon as the wreck has been removed; they shall not unnecessarily interfere with the rights and interests of other states including the state of the ship's registry, and of any person, physical or corporate, concerned.4 the application of this convention within the convention area shall not entitle a state party to claim or exercise sovereignty or sovereign rights over any part of the high seas.5 states parties shall endeavour to co-operate when the effects of a maritime casualty resulting in a wreck involve a state other than the affected state ARTICLE 3scope of application1 except as otherwise provided in this convention, this convention shall apply to wrecks in the

convention to wrecks located within its territory, including the territorial sea, this is without prejudice to the rights and obligations of that state to take measures in relation to wrecks located in its territory, including the territorial sea, other than locating, marking and removing them in accordance with this convention. the provisions of articles 10, 11 and 12 of this convention shall not apply to any measures so taken other than those referred to in articles 7, 8 and 9 of this convention.3 when a state party has made a notification under paragraph 2, the "convention area" of the

hazard, it shall ensure that all practicable steps are taken to establish the precise location of the wreck ARTICLE 8marking of wrecks1 if the affected state determines that a wreck constitutes a hazard, that state shall ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to mark the wreck.2 in marking the wreck, all practicable steps shall be taken to ensure that the markings conform to the internationally accepted system of buoyage in use in the area where the wreck is located.3 the affected state shall promulgate the particulars of the marking of the wreck by use of all appropriate means, including the appropriate nautical publications ARTICLE 9measures to facilitate the removal of wrecks1 if the affected state determines that a wreck constitutes a hazard, that state shall immediately:(a) inform the state of the ship's registry and the registered owner; and(b) proceed to consult the state of the ship's registry and other states affected by the wreck regarding measures to be taken in relation to the wreck.2 the registered owner shall remove a wreck determined to constitute a hazard.3 when a wreck has been determined to constitute a hazard, the registered owner, or

with any salvor or other person to remove the wreck determined to constitute a hazard on behalf of the owner. before such removal commences, the affected state may lay down conditions for such removal

the nature of the hazard determined in accordance with article 6;(b) inform the registered owner in writing of the deadline it has set and specify that, if the registered owner does not remove the wreck within that deadline, it may remove the wreck at the registered owner's expense; and(c) inform the registered owner in writing that it intends to intervene immediately in circumstances where the hazard becomes particularly severe.7 if the registered owner does not remove the wreck within the deadline set in accordance with paragraph 6(a), or the registered owner cannot be contacted, the affected state may remove the wreck by the most practical and expeditious means available, consistent with considerations of safety and protection of the marine environment.8 in circumstances where immediate action is required and the affected state has informed the state of the ship's registry and the registered owner accordingly, it may remove the wreck by the most practical and expeditious means available, consistent with considerations of safety and protection of the marine environment.9 states parties shall take appropriate measures under their national law to ensure that their registered owners comply with paragraphs 2 and 3.10 states parties give their consent to the affected state to act under paragraphs 4 to 8, where required.11 the information referred to in this

prejudice any right of recourse against third parties ARTICLE 11exceptions to liability1 the registered owner shall not be liable under this convention for the costs mentioned in article 10, paragraph

compensation payable to salvors to the exclusion of the rules of this convention ARTICLE 12compulsory insurance or other financial security1 the registered owner of a ship of 300 gross tonnage and above and flying the flag of a state party shall be required to maintain insurance or other financial security, such as a guarantee of a bank or similar institution, to cover liability under this convention in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime, but in all cases not exceeding an amount calculated in accordance with article 6(1)(b) of the convention on limitation of liability for maritime claims, 1976, as amended.2 a certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this convention shall be issued to each ship of 300 gross tonnage and above by the appropriate authority of the state of the ship's registry after determining that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. with respect to a ship registered in a state party, such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the state of the ship's registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a state party it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any state party. this compulsory insurance certificate shall be in the

shall undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this obligation.(b) a state party shall notify the secretary-general of:(i) the specific responsibilities and conditions of the authority delegated to an institution or organization recognized by it;(ii) the withdrawal of such authority; and(iii) the date from which such authority or withdrawal of such authority takes effect.an authority delegated shall not take effect prior to three months from the date on which notification to that effect was given to the secretary-general.(c) the institution or organization authorized to issue certificates in accordance with this paragraph shall, as a minimum, be authorized to withdraw these certificates if the conditions under which they have been issued are not maintained. in all cases the institution or organization shall report such withdrawal to the state on whose behalf the certificate was issued.4 the certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing state. if the language used is not english, french or spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages and, where the state so decides, the official language(s) of the state may be omitted.5 the certificate shall be carried on board the ship and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered in a state party, with the authorities issuing or certifying the certificate.6 an insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this article if it can cease for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate under paragraph 2 before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 5 unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. the foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification, which results in the insurance or security no longer satisfying the requirements of this article.7 the state of the ship's registry shall, subject to the provisions of this article and having regard to any guidelines adopted by the organization on the financial responsibility of the registered owners, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate.8 nothing in this convention shall be construed as preventing a state party from relying on information obtained from other states or the organization or other international organizations relating to the financial standing of providers of insurance or financial security for the purposes of this convention. in such cases, the state party relying on such information is not relieved of its responsibility as a state issuing the certificate required by paragraph 2.9 certificates issued and certified under the authority of a state party shall be accepted by other states parties for the purposes of this convention and shall be regarded by other states parties as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them, even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a state party. a state party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying state should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this convention.10 any claim for costs arising under this convention may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security for the registered owner's liability. in such a case the defendant may invoke the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up of the registered owner) that the registered owner would have been entitled to invoke, including limitation of liability under any applicable national or international regime. furthermore, even if the registered owner is not entitled to limit liability, the defendant may limit liability to an amount equal to the amount of the insurance or other financial security required to be maintained in accordance with paragraph 1. moreover, the defendant may invoke the defence that the maritime casualty was caused by the wilful misconduct of the registered owner, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the registered owner against the defendant. the defendant shall in any event have the right to require the registered owner to be joined in the proceedings.11 a state party shall not permit any ship entitled to fly its flag to which this article applies to operate at any time unless a certificate has been issued under paragraphs 2 or 14.12 subject to the provisions of this article, each state party shall ensure, under its national law, that insurance or other security to the extent required by paragraph 1 is in force in respect of any ship of 300 gross tonnage and above, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving from an offshore facility in its territorial sea.13 notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, a state party may notify the secretary-general that, for the purposes of paragraph 12, ships are not required to carry on board or to produce the certificate required by paragraph 2, when entering or leaving a port in its territory, or arriving at or leaving from an offshore facility in its territorial sea, provided that the state party which issues the certificate required by paragraph 2 has notified the secretary-general that it maintains records in an electronic format, accessible to all states parties, attesting the existence of the certificate and enabling states parties to discharge their obligations under paragraph 12.14 if insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a state party, the provisions of this article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authority of the state of registry, stating that it is owned by that state and that the ship's liability is covered within the limits prescribed in paragraph 1. such a certificate shall follow as closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2 ARTICLE 13time limitsrights to recover costs under this convention shall be extinguished unless an action is brought hereunder within three years from the date when the hazard has been determined in accordance with this convention. however, in no case shall an action be brought after six years from the date of the maritime casualty that resulted in the wreck. where the maritime casualty consists of a series of occurrences, the six-year period shall run from the date of the first occurrence ARTICLE 14amendment provisions1 at the request of not less than one-third of states parties, a conference shall be convened by the organization for the purpose of revising or amending this convention.2 any consent to be bound by this convention, expressed after

twelve months after one state party has notified another that a dispute exists between them, the provisions relating to the settlement of disputes set out in part xv of the united nations convention on the law of the sea, 1982, shall apply mutatis mutandis, whether or not the states party to the dispute are also states parties to the united nations convention on the law of the sea, 1982.3 any
