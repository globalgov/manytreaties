european convention for the protection of animals during international transport (revised)source: the member states of the council of europe, signatory hereto,considering that the aim of the council of europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage;aware that every person has a moral obligation to respect all animals and to have due consideration for their capacity for suffering;motivated by the desire to safeguard the welfare of animals during transport;convinced that international transport is compatible with the welfare of the animals, provided that the requirements of animal welfare are met;considering, therefore, that where the welfare requirements of the animals cannot be met an alternative to the transport of live animals shall be implemented;considering, however, that in general, for reasons of animal welfare the period during which animals, including animals for slaughter, are transported should be reduced as far as possible;considering that loading and unloading are activities during which injuries and stress are most likely to occur;considering that progress in this respect may be achieved through the adoption of common provisions regarding the international transport of animals,have agreed as follows:general principles ARTICLE 1 - definitions1 "international transport" means any movement from one country to another, but excludes, however, journeys of less than 50 km and movements between member states of the european community.2 an "authorised veterinarian" means a veterinarian nominated by the competent authority.3 "person responsible for the transport of the animals" means the person with overall control over the organisation, carrying out and completion of the whole journey, regardless of whether duties are subcontracted to other parties during transport. such a person is usually the person who plans, makes arrangements for and defines the conditions to be met by other parties.4 "person in charge of the welfare of the animals" means the person who has direct physical responsibility for the care of the animals during transport. such a person may be the attendant or the driver of a vehicle if fulfilling the same role.5 "container" means any crate, box, receptacle or other rigid container used for the transport of animals which is not self-propelled and is not a part (whether detachable or not) of a means of transport.6 "transporter" means a natural or legal person transporting animals, either on his own account or for a third party ARTICLE 2 - species1 this convention applies to the international transport of all vertebrate animals.2 with the exception of article 4, paragraph 1, and article 9, paragraphs 1 and 2 a. and c., the provisions of this convention do not apply:a where a single animal is accompanied by the person who is responsible for it during transport;b to the transport of pet animals accompanying their owner if not for commercial purposes ARTICLE 3 -

authorisation of transporters1 each party shall ensure that transporters transporting animals for commercial purposes are:a registered in a manner enabling the competent authority to identify them rapidly in the event of failure to comply with the requirements of this convention;b covered by an authorisation valid for international transport granted by the competent authority of the party in which the transporters are established.2 each party shall ensure that the authorisation is granted to transporters who entrust the transport of animals only to personnel who have received proper training on the provisions of this convention.3 each party shall ensure that the above-mentioned authorisation may be suspended or withdrawn where the competent authorities that granted the authorisation are informed that the transporter has repeatedly or seriously violated the provisions of this convention.4 where a party has observed an infringement of this convention by a transporter registered in another party to this convention, the former party shall communicate details of the infringement observed to the latter.design and construction ARTICLE 6 -
