Article 16

1. In the event of specific rules being introduced as a result of the implementation of its agricultural policy or of any alteration of the current rules or in the event of any alteration or extension of the provisions relating to the implementation of its agricultural policy, the Party concerned may amend the arrangements resulting from this Agreement in respect of the products concerned.

or

(b) a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to the exporting Party,

and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise, to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in paragraph 2.

The measures shall be non-discriminatory and shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.

(b) a "juridical person" means a company or a subsidiary, set up in accordance with the laws either of a Member State of the Community or of Lebanon and having its registered office, central administration or principal place of business in the territory either of the Community or of Lebanon.
