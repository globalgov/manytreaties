incident will exist;(ii) and further, in the case of reactors, the expected date on which they will first reach criticality, and also their thermal power.d)each contracting party shall also communicate to the belgian government the exact date of the existence of the risk of a nuclear incident and in the case of reactors, the date on which they first reached criticality.e)each contracting party shall also communicate to the belgian government all modifications to be made to the list. where such modifications include the addition of a nuclear installation, the communication must be made at least three months before the expected date on which the risk of a nuclear incident will exist.f)if a contracting party is of the opinion that the particulars, or any modification to be made to the list, communicated by another contracting party do not comply with the provisions of article 2 (a) (i) and of this article, it may raise objections thereto only by addressing them to the belgian
