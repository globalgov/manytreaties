NOTE I
EMBASSY OF THE NETHERLANDS
Brussels, 24 February 1961
1752
Sir,
In view of the signing on this day of
the Treaty for the improvement of the
connexion between the Juliana Canal
and the Albert Canal, I have the honour,
on behalf of my Government, to make to
you the following proposals :
1. The Netherlands shall be authorized
to dismantle lock 19 of the Zuid-Willemsvaart
waterway, referred to in the Treaty
of 12 May 1863 to regulate the r6gime of
the diversion of water from the Meuse, and
to fill in the part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart
waterway lying to the south of the junction
of the connecting canal with the lift lock
in the Bosscheveld.
2. The Netherlands shall be authorized
to replace the feeder culvert of the Zuid-
Willemsvaart waterway, referred to in the
aforesaid Treaty, by a new feeder culvert
to be constructed north of the projected
canal connexion referred to in article 10 of
the Treaty for the improvement of -the
connexion between the Juliana Canal and
the Albert Canal, signed today.
3. The two Governments shall hold
consultations with a view to the revision of
the Treaty of 12 May 1863, as well as of the
Agreement of 11 January 1873 amending
article 6 of that Treaty, in order to adapt
it to the new situation regarding the canals,
and shall endeavour to ensure that such
revision comes into force within three
years of the entry into force of the Treaty
signed this day.
If your Government is able to agree to
the foregoing, I have the honour to propose
that this letter and your reply of
similar purport shall be regarded as constituting
an agreement between our Governments.
This Agreement shall come
into force after the two Governments
have informed each other that the Agreement
has been approved in accordance
with the constitutional requirements, it
being understood that the Agreement
shall not come into force earlier than the
aforesaid Treaty for the improvement of
the connexion between the Juliana Canal
and the Albert Canal.
I have the honour to be, etc.
