The Parties consider that the establishment and effective functioning of the International Criminal Court constitutes an important development for international peace and justice and that the Court represents an effective instrument to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole when national courts are not willing or able to do so, given the International Criminal Court's complementarity to national criminal jurisdiction.

2.   This dialogue shall be aimed, inter alia, at fighting the threat of climate change, biodiversity conservation, the protection and sustainable management of forests to, inter alia, reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, the protection of hydro and marine resources, basins and wetlands, the research and development of alternative fuels and renewable energy technologies and the reform of environmental governance in view of increasing its efficiency.

Article 21

Citizen Security

The Parties retain their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (hereinafter referred to as the "Anti-Dumping Agreement") and from the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (hereinafter referred to as the "SCM Agreement") and the WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement on Rules of Origin").

2.   Where anti-dumping or countervailing measures can be imposed on a regional basis and on a national basis, the Parties shall ensure that such anti-dumping or countervailing measures are not applied simultaneously in respect of the same product by regional and national authorities.

Article 93

Transparency and Legal Certainty

1.   The Parties agree that trade remedies shall be used in full compliance with WTO requirements and shall be based on a fair and transparent system.

2.   Recognising the benefits of legal certainty and predictability for the economic operators, the Parties shall ensure that, where applicable, their respective domestic legislation in the field of anti-dumping and countervailing measures is and will remain harmonised and fully compatible with WTO legislation.

3.   Notwithstanding Article 6.9 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 12.8 of the SCM Agreement, it is desirable that the Parties ensure, immediately after any imposition of provisional measures, complete and meaningful disclosure of all essential facts and considerations which form the basis for the decision to apply measures, without prejudice to Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 12.4 of the SCM Agreement. Disclosures shall be made in writing and shall be provided to interested parties with sufficient time to defend their interests.

4.   Upon request of the interested parties, the Parties shall grant them the possibility to be heard in order to express their views during anti-dumping or countervailing measures investigations. This shall not unnecessarily delay the conduct of the investigations.

Article 94

Consideration of Public Interest

A Party may choose not to apply anti-dumping or countervailing measures where, on the basis of the information made available during the investigation, it can clearly be concluded that it is not in the public interest to apply such measures.

Article 95

Lesser Duty Rule

Where a Party decides to impose an anti-dumping or countervailing duty, the amount of such duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping or countervailable subsidies, but it is desirable that the duty be less than this margin if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.

Article 96

Causal Link

In order to impose anti-dumping or countervailing measures, and in accordance with the provisions established in Article 3.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 15.5 of the SCM Agreement, investigating authorities shall, as part of the demonstration of a causal relationship between the dumped imports and the injury to the domestic industry, separate and distinguish the injurious effects of all known factors from the injurious effects of the dumped or subsidized imports.

Article 97

Cumulative Assessment

When imports from more than one country are simultaneously subject to anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigations, the investigating authority of the EU Party shall examine with special care whether the cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports from any Republic of the CA Party, is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported products and the like domestic product.

Article 98

Exclusion from Dispute Settlement Procedures

The Parties shall not have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under Title X (Dispute Settlement) of Part IV of this Agreement for matters arising under this Section.

Article 100

Non Cumulation

Neither Party may apply, with respect to the same product, at the same time:

(a)

a bilateral safeguard measure in accordance with Sub-Section B.3 (Bilateral Safeguard Measures) of this Chapter; and

Sub-section B.2

Multilateral safeguard measures

Article 101

General Provisions

The Parties retain their rights and obligations under Article XIX of GATT 1994, the Safeguards Agreement, Article 5 of the Agriculture Agreement and the Agreement on Rules of Origin.

Article 102

Notwithstanding Article 101, at the request of the other Party, the Party initiating an investigation or intending to take safeguard measures shall provide immediately ad hoc written notification of all pertinent information including where relevant, on the initiation of a safeguard investigation, on the provisional findings and on the final findings of the investigation.

Article 103

Exclusion from Dispute Settlement Procedures

The Parties shall not have recourse to dispute settlement procedures under Title X (Dispute Settlement) of Part IV of this Agreement for provisions referring to WTO rights and obligations arising under this Sub-Section.

Sub-section B.3

Bilateral safeguard measures

Article 104

Application of a Bilateral Safeguard Measure

1.   Notwithstanding Sub-Section B.2 (Multilateral Safeguard Measures), if as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, a product originating in a Party is being imported into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions so as to constitute a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products, the importing Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Sub-Section.

2.   If the conditions in paragraph 1 are met, the safeguard measures of the importing Party may only consist of one of the following:

(a)

suspension of the further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the product concerned provided for under this Agreement; or

(b)

increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a level which does not exceed the lesser of:

(i)

the most-favoured nation applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or

(ii)

the most-favoured nation applied rate of customs duty on the product in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

3.   In case of products which were already fully liberalised before the entry into force of this Agreement following tariff preferences granted before the entry into force of this Agreement, the EU Party shall examine with special care whether increased imports result from the reduction or elimination of customs duties under this Agreement.

4.   None of the above measures shall be applied within the limits of the preferential duty free tariff quotas granted by this Agreement.

Article 105

Conditions and Limitations

1.   A bilateral safeguard measure may not be applied:

(a)

except to the extent, and for such time, as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the situation described in Article 104 or 109;

(b)

for a period exceeding two years. The period may be extended by another two years if the competent authorities of the importing Party determine, in conformity with the procedures specified in this Sub-Section, that the measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the situations described in Article 104 or 109, provided that the total period of application of a safeguard measure, including the period of initial application and any extension thereof, does not exceed four years; or

(c)

beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the consent of the other Party. "Transition period" means ten years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. For any good for which the Schedule in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties) of the Party applying the measure provides for tariff elimination of ten or more years, transition period means the tariff elimination period for the goods set out in that Schedule, plus three years.

2.   When a Party ceases to apply a bilateral safeguard measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate that would have been in effect for the good, according to the Schedule of that Party.

Article 106

Provisional Measures

In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to repair, a Party may apply a bilateral safeguard measure on a provisional basis, without complying with the requirements of Article 116, paragraph 1 of this Chapter, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports of a product originating in the other Party have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and that such imports cause or threaten to cause the situations described in Article 104 or 109. The duration of any provisional measure shall not exceed two hundred days, during which time the Party shall comply with the relevant procedural rules laid down in Sub-Section B.4 (Procedural Rules Applicable to Bilateral Safeguard Measures). The Party shall promptly refund any tariff increases if the investigation described in Sub-Section B.4 does not result in a finding that the requirements of Article 104 are met. The duration of any provisional measure shall be counted as part of the period described in Article 105, paragraph 1(b). The importing Party concerned shall inform the other Party concerned upon taking such provisional measures and it shall immediately refer the matter to the Association Committee for examination if the other Party so requests.

Article 107

Compensation and Suspension of Concessions

1.   A Party applying a bilateral safeguard measure shall consult with the Party whose products are subject to the measure in order to mutually agree on appropriate trade liberalising compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effect. The Party shall provide an opportunity for such consultations no later than thirty days after the application of the bilateral safeguard measure.

2.   If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an agreement on trade liberalising compensation within thirty days, the Party whose products are subject to the safeguard measure may suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the trade of the Party applying the safeguard measure.

Article 108

Time Lapse in between Two Measures

No safeguard measure referred to in this Sub-Section shall be applied to the import of a product that has previously been subject to such a measure, unless a period of time equal to half of that during which the safeguard measure was applied for the immediately preceding period has elapsed.

Article 109

Outermost Regions

1.   Where any product originating in one or several of the Republics of the CA Party is being imported into the territory of one or several outermost regions of the EU Party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious deterioration in the economic situation of the outermost region(s) concerned of the EU Party, the EU Party, after having examined alternative solutions, may exceptionally take safeguard measures limited to the territory of the region(s) concerned.

2.   Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1, other rules laid down in this Sub-Section applicable to bilateral safeguards are also applicable to any safeguard adopted under this Article.

3.   The Association Council may discuss whether in cases of threat of, or serious deterioration in the economic situation of extremely underdeveloped regions of the Republics of the CA Party, this Article may also apply to those regions.

Sub-section B.4

Procedural rules applicable to bilateral safeguard measures

Article 110

Applicable Law

For the application of bilateral safeguard measures, the competent investigating authority shall comply with the provisions of this Sub-Section and in cases not covered by this Sub-Section, the competent investigating authority shall apply the rules established under its domestic legislation.

Article 111

Initiation of a Proceeding

1.   Pursuant to each Party's domestic legislation, a safeguard proceeding may be initiated by the competent investigating authority on its own initiative, upon receipt of information from one or more Member States of the European Union, or upon a written application by entities specified in domestic legislation. In the cases when the proceeding is initiated on the basis of a written application, the entity filing the application shall demonstrate that it is representative of the domestic industry producing a good like or directly competitive with the imported good.

2.   Once the written applications have been filed, these shall promptly be made available for public inspections, except for the confidential information contained.

3.   Upon initiation of a safeguard proceeding, the competent investigating authority shall publish a notice of initiation of the proceeding in the official journal of the Party. The notice shall identify the entity which filed the written application, if applicable, the imported good that is the subject of the proceeding and its subheading and the tariff item number under which it is classified, the nature and timing of the determination to be made, the time and place of the public hearing or the period within which interested parties may apply to be heard orally by the investigating authority, the period within which interested parties may make known their views in writing and submit information, the place at which the written application and any other non-confidential documents filed in the course of the proceeding may be inspected and the name, address and telephone number of the office to be contacted for more information.

4.   With respect to a safeguard proceeding initiated on the basis of a written application filed by an entity asserting that it is representative of the domestic industry, the competent investigating authority shall not publish the notice required by paragraph 3 without first assessing carefully that the written application meets the requirements of its domestic legislation.

Article 112

Investigation

1.   A Party may apply a safeguard measure only following an investigation by the competent investigating authority of that Party pursuant to procedures laid down in this Sub-Section. This investigation shall include reasonable public notice to all interested parties and public hearings or other appropriate means in which importers, exporters and other interested parties could present evidence and their views, including the opportunity to respond to the presentations of other parties.

2.   Each Party shall ensure that its competent investigating authority completes any such investigation within twelve months of its date of initiation.

Article 113

Evidence of Injury and Causal Link

1.   In conducting its proceeding, the competent investigating authority shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of the domestic industry, in particular the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the good concerned in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports, and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment.

2.   The determination whether increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause the situations described in Article 104 or 109, shall not be made, unless the investigation demonstrates, on the basis of objective evidence, the existence of a clear causal link between increased imports of the good concerned and the situations described in Article 104 or 109. Where factors other than increased imports are, at the same time, causing the situations described in Article 104 or 109, such injury or serious deterioration in the economic situation shall not be attributed to increased imports.

Article 114

Hearings

In the course of each proceeding, the competent investigating authority shall:

(a)

hold a public hearing, after providing reasonable notice, to allow all interested parties and any representative consumer association, to appear in person or by counsel, to present evidence and to be heard on serious injury or threat of serious injury, and the appropriate remedy; or

(b)

provide an opportunity to all interested parties to be heard where they have made a written application within the period laid down in the notice of initiation showing that they are actually likely to be affected by the outcome of the investigation and that there are special reasons for them to be heard orally.

Article 115

Confidential Information

Any information which is by nature confidential or which is provided on a confidential basis shall, upon cause being shown, be treated as such by the competent investigating authority. Such information shall not be disclosed without permission of the Party submitting it. Parties providing confidential information may be requested to furnish non-confidential summaries thereof or, if such parties indicate that such information cannot be summarised, the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. However, if the competent investigating authority finds that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the party concerned is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorise its disclosure in generalised or summary form, the authority may disregard such information unless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the information is correct.

Article 116

Notifications and Publications

1.   Where a Party takes the view that one of the circumstances set out in Article 104 or 109 exists, it shall immediately refer the matter to the Association Committee for examination. The Association Committee may make any recommendation needed to remedy the circumstances which have arisen. If no recommendation has been made by the Association Committee aimed at remedying the circumstances, or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Association Committee, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the circumstances in accordance with this Sub-Section.

2.   The competent investigating authority shall provide the exporting Party with all pertinent information, which shall include evidence of injury or serious deterioration in the economic situation, caused by increased imports, precise description of the product involved and the proposed measures, proposed date of imposition and expected duration.

3.   The competent investigating authority shall also publish its findings and reasoned conclusions reached on all pertinent issues of fact and law in the official journal of the Party, including the description of the imported good and the situation which has given rise to the imposition of measures in accordance with Article 104 or 109, the causal link between such situation and the increased imports, and the form, level and duration of the measures.

4.   The competent investigating authority shall not disclose any information provided pursuant to any undertaking concerning confidential information that may have been made in the course of the proceedings.

(b)

when one of the Parties identifies a particular problem related to an actual or proposed technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure that may affect trade between the Parties, that exporting Party may seek clarification and guidance on how to comply with the measure of the importing Party. The latter will promptly give due attention to this request and take into consideration the concerns expressed by the exporting Party;

To this end, the Parties undertake to carry out joint actions that may include:

(a)

strengthening their cooperation in the field of standards, technical regulations, metrology, accreditation and conformity assessment with a view to increasing mutual understanding of their respective systems and, in areas of common interest, explore trade facilitation initiatives which lead to the convergence of their regulatory requirements. To this end, they may establish regulatory dialogues at both horizontal and sectoral levels;

(b)

seeking to identify, develop and promote trade facilitating initiatives which may include, but are not limited to:

reinforcing regulatory cooperation through, for example, the exchange of information, expertise and data, and scientific and technical cooperation with a view to improving the way technical regulations are developed, in terms of transparency and consultation, and making an efficient use of regulatory resources;

(ii)

simplifying procedures and requirements; and

(iii)

promoting and encouraging bilateral cooperation between their respective organisations, public or private, responsible for metrology, standardisation, testing, certification and accreditation;

the Party shall, where legitimate objectives under the TBT Agreement are not compromised and the information can properly reach the consumer, endeavour to accept non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than physically attached to the product; and

(f)

the Parties shall allow that labelling and corrections to labelling take place in the country of destination prior to the commercialisation of the goods.

3.   Upon receipt of a recommendation referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Association Committee shall, within a reasonable time, review the recommendation with a view to determining whether it is consistent with this Title.

4.   When, in conformity with the procedure set out in paragraph 3, a recommendation referred to in paragraph 2 has been found to be consistent with this Title and there is a sufficient level of correspondence between the relevant regulations of the Parties, the Parties shall encourage their competent authorities to negotiate an agreement on mutual recognition of requirements, qualifications, licences and other regulations with a view to implementing that recommendation.

5.   Any such agreement shall be in conformity with the relevant provisions of the WTO Agreement and, in particular, Article VII of GATS.

Article 179

Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service or establishment for which a specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of a Party shall, within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application. At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application.

SECTION B

Computer services

Article 180

Understanding on Computer Services

1.   To the extent that trade in computer services is committed in the lists of commitments in accordance with Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this Title, the Parties subscribe to the understanding defined in the following paragraphs.

2.   CPC 84 (21), the United Nations code used for describing computer and related services, covers the basic functions used to provide all computer and related services: computer programs defined as the sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate (including their development and implementation), data processing and storage, and related services, such as consultancy and training services for staff of clients. Technological developments have led to the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of related services that can include some or all of these basic functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services functions.

3.   Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services that provide:

(a)

consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of or for computers or computer systems; or

(b)

computer programs defined as the sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), plus consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of or for computer programs; or

(c)

data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services; or

(d)

maintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers; and

(e)

training services for staff of clients, related to computer programs, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.

4.   Computer and related services enable the provision of other services (for example financial services) by both electronic and other means. However, there is an important distinction between the enabling service (for example web-hosting, data processing or application hosting) and the content or core service that is being delivered electronically (for example financial services). In such cases, the content or core service is not covered by CPC 84.

General Principles

1.   With respect to any measure and any covered procurement, each Party, including its procuring entities, shall accord to the goods and services of the other Party and to the suppliers of the other Party offering the goods or services of any Party, treatment no less favourable than the treatment the Party, including its procuring entities, accords to domestic goods, services and suppliers.

(a)

treat a locally established supplier less favourably than another locally established supplier on the basis of degree of foreign affiliation or ownership; nor

(b)

discriminate against a locally established supplier on the basis that the goods or services offered by that supplier for a particular procurement are goods or services of the other Party.

Any EU Party supplier or service provider established in one Republic of the CA Party shall be accorded in all other Republics of the CA Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment the latter accord to their own suppliers or service providers with respect to any measure regarding a covered procurement.

Any supplier or service provider from a Republic of the CA Party established in one Member State of the European Union shall be accorded in all other Member States of the European Union treatment no less favourable than the treatment the latter accord to their own suppliers or service providers with respect to any measure regarding a covered procurement.

The Parties shall not introduce new requirements on the local establishment or registration of suppliers and service providers wishing to submit a tender in a covered procurement that would set suppliers and service providers of the other Party at a competitive disadvantage. Existing requirements will be subject to a review within ten years from the entry into force of this Agreement (32).

4.   If a procuring entity conducts a covered procurement by electronic means, it shall:

(a)

Additionally, the Parties shall establish or maintain sanctions against such corruptive practices.

For purposes of covered procurement, no Party shall apply rules of origin to goods or services imported from or supplied by another Party that are different from the rules of origin the Party applies, at the same time, in the normal course of trade to imports or supplies of the same goods or services from the same Party.

7.   Subject to the exceptions contained in this Title or the annexes pertaining thereto, no Party shall seek, take account of, impose or enforce offsets.

Article 212

2.   Procuring entities are encouraged to publish, as early as possible, each year, a notice regarding their future procurement plans (hereinafter referred to as "notice of planned procurement"). The notice shall include the subject-matter of the procurement and the approximate date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement or in which the procurement may be held.

3.

Article 214

Conditions for Participation

1.   A procuring entity shall limit any conditions for participation in a procurement to those that are essential to ensure that a supplier has the legal and financial capacities and the commercial and technical abilities to undertake the relevant procurement.

2.   In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for participation, a procuring entity shall evaluate the financial, commercial and technical abilities of the supplier on the basis of that supplier's business activities both in and out of the territory of the Party of the procuring entity, and it may not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement, that supplier must have previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of a given Party or that the supplier must have prior work experience in the territory of a given Party.

3.   In making this assessment, the procuring entity shall base its evaluation on the conditions that it has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation.

4.   A procuring entity may exclude a supplier on grounds such as bankruptcy, false declarations, significant deficiencies in performance of any substantive requirement or obligation under a prior contract or contracts, judgments regarding crimes or other judgments regarding serious public offences, professional misconduct, failure to pay taxes or similar reasons.

Each Party may adopt or maintain procedures to declare ineligible for participation in the Party's procurements, either indefinitely or for a specified time, suppliers that the Party has found to have engaged in fraudulent or other illegal actions in relation to procurement. Upon request of the other Party, a Party shall identify, to the extent practicable, the suppliers determined to be ineligible under these procedures, and, where appropriate, exchange information regarding those suppliers or the fraudulent or illegal action.

5.   The procuring entity may ask the tenderer to indicate in the tender any share of the contract the tenderer may intend to subcontract to third parties and any proposed subcontractors. This indication shall be without prejudice of questioning the principal economic operator's liability.

Article 215

Qualification or Registration of Suppliers

1.   Where a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, the entity shall:

include in the notice of intended procurement at least the information specified in paragraph 1 of Appendix 4 (Notice of Intended Procurement), to Annex XVI and invite suppliers to submit a request for participation; and

(b)

provide, by the commencement of the time-period for tendering, at least the information specified in paragraph 2 of Appendix 4 (Notice of Intended Procurement) to Annex XVI to the qualified or registered suppliers.

2.   A procuring entity shall recognise as qualified suppliers any domestic suppliers and any suppliers of the other Party that meet the conditions for participation in a particular procurement, unless the procuring entity states in the notice of intended procurement any limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender and the criteria for selecting the limited number of suppliers.

3.   Where the tender documentation is not made publicly available from the date of publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 1, a procuring entity shall ensure that those documents are made available at the same time to all qualified suppliers selected in accordance with paragraph 2.

4.   A procuring entity may maintain a list of suppliers, provided that a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion in the list is published annually, and where published by electronic means, made available continuously in the appropriate medium listed in Appendix 3 (Media for Publication of Notices) to Annex XVI. Such a notice shall include the information set out in Appendix 5 (Notice Inviting Interested Suppliers to Apply for Inclusion in a List of Suppliers) to Annex XVI.

5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 4, where a list of suppliers will be valid for three years or less, a procuring entity may publish the notice referred to in that paragraph only once, at the beginning of the period of validity of the list, provided that the notice states the period of validity and that further notices will not be published.

6.   A procuring entity shall allow suppliers to apply at any time for inclusion on a list of suppliers and shall include on the list within a reasonable short time all suppliers that have complied with the corresponding requirements.

7.   A procuring entity may, if so foreseen by the Party's legislation, use a notice inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion in a list of suppliers as a notice of intended procurement, provided that:

(a)

the notice is published in accordance with paragraph 4 and includes the information required by Appendix 5 (Notice Inviting Interested Suppliers to Apply for Inclusion in a List of Suppliers) and as much of the information required by Appendix 4 (Notice of Intended Procurement) to Annex XVI as is available, and contains a statement that it constitutes a notice of intended procurement;

(b)

the procuring entity promptly provides to suppliers that have expressed an interest to the entity in a given procurement, sufficient information to permit them to assess their interest in the procurement, including all remaining information required by Appendix 4 (Notice of Intended Procurement) to Annex XVI, to the extent that such information is available; and

(c)

a supplier having applied for inclusion on a list of suppliers in accordance with paragraph 6, may be allowed to tender in a given procurement, where there is sufficient time for the procuring entity to examine whether it satisfies the conditions for participation.

8.   A procuring entity shall promptly inform any supplier that submits a request for participation or application for inclusion on a list of suppliers of the procuring entity's decision with respect to the request.

9.   Where a procuring entity rejects a supplier's request to qualify or application for inclusion on a list of suppliers, ceases to recognise a supplier as qualified, or removes a supplier from a list of suppliers, the entity shall promptly inform the supplier and, on request of the supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written explanation of the reasons for its decision.

10.   The Parties shall indicate in Section F (General Notes) to Appendix 1 (Coverage) to Annex XVI, which entities may use lists of suppliers.

Article 216

Technical Specifications

1.   A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade.

2.   In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or services being procured, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate:

(a)

set out the technical specifications in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and

(b)

base the technical specifications on international standards, where these exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognized national standards or building codes.

3.   Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the technical specifications, a procuring entity shall indicate, where appropriate, that it will consider tenders of equivalent goods or services that demonstrably fulfil the requirements of the procurement by including such words as "or equivalent" in the tender documentation.

4.   A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in such cases, the entity includes words such as "or equivalent" in the tender documentation.

5.   A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement, from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement.

6.   For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a procuring entity from preparing, adopting, or applying technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or protect the environment.

Article 217

Tender Documentation

1.   A procuring entity shall provide to suppliers, tender documentation that includes all information necessary to permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders. Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall include a complete description of the issues set out in Appendix 8 (Tender Documentation) to Annex XVI.

2.   A procuring entity shall promptly provide, upon request, the tender documentation to any supplier participating in the procurement; and reply to any reasonable request for relevant information made by a supplier participating in the procurement, provided that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over its competitors in the procurement and that the request was presented within the corresponding time limits.

3.   Where, in the course of a procurement, a procuring entity modifies or amends the criteria or requirements set out in the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation provided to participating suppliers, it shall transmit in writing all such modifications:

(a)

to all suppliers that are participating at the time the information is amended, if known, and in all other cases, in the same manner as the original information; and

(b)

in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and re-submit amended tenders, as appropriate.

Article 218

Time Periods

A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own needs, provide sufficient time for suppliers to prepare and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders, taking into account such factors as the nature and complexity of the procurement, the extent of subcontracting anticipated, and the time for transmitting tenders from foreign as well as domestic points where electronic means are not used. Such time-periods, including any extension of the time periods, shall be the same for all interested or participating suppliers. The applicable time periods are set out in Appendix 6 (Time Periods) to Annex XVI.

Article 219

Negotiations

1.   Each Party may provide for its procuring entities to conduct procurements through the negotiations procedure, in the following cases:

(a)

in the context of procurements in which they have indicated such intent in the notice of intended procurement; or

(b)

where it appears from the evaluation that no one tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notices or tender documentation.

2.   A procuring entity shall:

(a)

ensure that any elimination of suppliers participating in negotiations is carried out in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the notices or tender documentation; and

(b)

where negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the remaining suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.

The Use of Limited Tendering or other equivalent Tendering Procedures

1.   Provided that the tendering procedure is not used to avoid competition or to protect domestic suppliers, a procuring entity may award contracts by limited tendering or other equivalent tendering procedures in the following circumstances:

(a)

where,

(i)

no tenders were submitted, or no suppliers requested participation;

(ii)

no tenders that conform to the essential requirements of the tender documentation were submitted;

(iii)

no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or

(iv)

the tenders submitted have been collusive;

provided that the requirements of the tender documentation are notsubstantially modified;

(b)

where, for works of art, or for reasons connected with the protection of exclusive intellectual property rights, such as patents or copyrights, or proprietary information, or where there is an absence of competition for technical reasons, the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists;

(c)

for additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods and services that were not included in the initial procurement where a change of supplier for such additional goods or services:

(i)

cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of inter-changeability or inter-operability with existing equipment, software, services or installations procured under the initial procurement; and

(ii)

would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the procuring entity;

(d)

for goods purchased on a commodity market;

(e)

where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study, or original development. When such contracts have been fulfilled, subsequent procurements of goods or services shall be subject to this Title;

(f)

where additional construction services that were not included in the initial contract but fell under the objectives of the original tender documentation, have, due to unforeseeable circumstances, become necessary to complete the construction services described therein. However, the total value of contracts awarded for additional construction services may not exceed fifty per cent of the amount of the initial contract;

(g)

in so far as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time by means of an open tendering procedure and the use of an open tendering procedure would result in serious injury to the procuring entity, the entity's program responsibilities, or the Party;

(h)

where a contract is awarded to a winner of a design contest provided that the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with the principles of this Title, and the participants are judged by an independent jury with a view to a design contract being awarded to a winner; or

(i)

in the cases established by each Party in Section F (General Notes) of Appendix 1 (Coverage) to Annex XVI.

2.   A procuring entity shall maintain records or prepare written reports providing specific justification for any contract awarded under paragraph 1.

Article 221

Electronic Auctions

Where a procuring entity intends to conduct a covered procurement using an electronic auction, the entity shall provide each participant, before commencing the electronic auction, with:

(a)

the automatic evaluation method, including the mathematical formula, that is based on the evaluation criteria set out in the tender documentation and that will be used in the automatic ranking or re-ranking during the auction;

(b)

the results of any initial evaluation of the elements of its tender where the contract is to be awarded on the basis of the most advantageous tender; and

(c)

any other relevant information relating to the conduct of the auction.

3.   Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, the entity shall award the contract to the supplier that the entity has determined to be capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notices and tender documentation, has submitted the most advantageous tender or where price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.

4.   Where a procuring entity receives a tender with a price that is abnormally lower than the prices in other tenders submitted, it may verify with the supplier that it satisfies the conditions for participation and is capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract.

Article 223

Transparency of Procurement Information

1.   A procuring entity shall promptly inform participating suppliers of the entity's contract award decisions and, upon request, shall do so in writing. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 224, a procuring entity shall, upon request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the entity did not select its tender and the relative advantages of the successful supplier's tender.

2.   After the award of each contract covered by this Title, a procuring entity shall, as early as possible, according to the time limits established in each Party's legislation, publish a notice in the appropriate paper or electronic media listed in Appendix 3 (Media for Publication of Notices) to Annex XVI.

Article 224

Disclosure of Information

1.   Upon request of the other Party, each Party shall promptly provide all relevant information about the adjudication of a covered procurement, in order to determine if the procurement was made in accordance with the rules of this Title.

2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not provide to any supplier information that might prejudice fair competition between suppliers.

3.   Nothing in this Title shall be construed to require a Party, including its procuring entities, authorities and review bodies, to disclose confidential information where disclosure would impede law enforcement; might prejudice fair competition between suppliers; would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons, including the protection of intellectual property; or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

Article 225

Domestic Review Procedures

1.   Each Party shall establish or maintain timely, effective, transparent and non-discriminatory administrative or judicial review procedures through which a supplier may present a challenge with respect to the obligations of a Party and its entities under this Title that may arise in the context of a covered procurement, in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest. The procedural rules for all challenges shall be in writing and made generally available.

2.   Each Party may foresee in its domestic legislation, that in the event of a complaint by a supplier arising in the context of a covered procurement, it shall encourage its procuring entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the complaint through consultation. The procuring entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any such complaint in a manner that is not prejudicial to the supplier's participation in ongoing or future procurement or his right to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial review procedure.

3.   Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and submit a challenge, which in no case shall be less than ten days from the time when the basis of the challenge became known or reasonably should have become known to the supplier.

4.   Each Party shall establish or designate at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of its procuring entities to receive and review a challenge by a supplier arising in the context of a covered procurement.

5.   Where a body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 4 initially reviews a challenge, the Party shall ensure that the supplier may appeal the initial decision to an impartial administrative or judicial authority that is independent of the procuring entity whose procurement is the subject of the challenge. A review body that is not a court shall either be subject to judicial review or have procedural guarantees that provide for:

(a)

the procuring entity shall respond in writing to the challenge and disclose all relevant documents to the review body;

(b)

the participants to the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as "the participants") shall have the right to be heard prior to a decision of the review body being made on the challenge;

(c)

the participants shall have the right to be represented and accompanied;

(d)

the participants shall have access to all proceedings; and

(e)

decisions or recommendations relating to challenges by suppliers shall be provided, within a reasonable time, in writing, with an explanation of the basis for each decision or recommendation.

6.   Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for:

(a)

prompt interim measures to preserve the supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement. Such interim measures may result in suspension of the procurement process. The procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account when deciding whether such measures should be applied. Just cause for not acting shall be provided in writing; and

(b)

corrective action or compensation for the loss or damages suffered, in accordance with each Party's legislation, in cases where a review body has determined that there has been a breach or a failure as set out in paragraph 1.

Article 226

Modifications and Rectifications of Coverage

1.   The EU Party shall address modifications and rectifications of coverage through bilateral negotiations with each Republic of the CA Party concerned. Inversely, each Republic of the CA Party shall address modifications and rectifications of coverage through bilateral negotiations with the EU Party.

Where a Party has the intention of modifying its coverage of procurement under this Title, the Party shall:

(a)

notify the other Party or Parties concerned in writing; and

(b)

include in the notification a proposal of appropriate compensatory adjustments to the other Party to maintain a level of coverage comparable to that existing prior to the modification.

2.   Notwithstanding subparagraph 1(b), a Party does not need to provide compensatory adjustments where:

(a)

the modification in question is a minor amendment or rectification of a purely formal nature; or

(b)

the proposed modification refers to an entity over which the Party has effectively eliminated its control or influence.

The Parties may make minor amendments or rectifications of a purely formal nature to their coverage under this Title, in accordance with the provisions of Title XIII (Specific Tasks in Trade Matters of the Bodies established under this Agreement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

3.   If the EU Party or the Republic of the CA Party concerned does not agree that:

(a)

the adjustment proposed under subparagraph 1(b) is adequate to maintain a comparable level of mutually agreed coverage;

(b)

the proposed modification is a minor amendment or a rectification under subparagraph 2(a); or

(c)

the proposed modification refers to an entity over which the Party has effectively eliminated its control or influence under subparagraph 2(b),

it must object in writing within thirty days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 1 or be deemed to have agreed to the adjustment or proposed modification including for the purposes of Title X (Dispute Settlement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

4.   Where the Parties concerned have agreed on the proposed modification, rectification, or minor amendment, including where no objection has been made within thirty days under paragraph 3, the modifications shall be made in conformity with the provisions of paragraph 6.

the use of a protected geographical indication for the same products that are not originating from the designated place of the geographical indication in question even if the true origin of the product is indicated or if the protected name is translated or accompanied by an expression such as ‧style‧, ‧type‧, ‧imitation‧, ‧like‧ or similar;

2.   Similarly, the Parties may, in accordance with their domestic or regional legislation, establish the grounds for rejecting the protection of geographical indications, including the option not to grant protection to a geographical indication where, in the light of a reputed or well-known trademark, protection is liable to mislead consumers as to the true identity of the product.

if the design does not correspond to the definition under Article 252, paragraph 1;

(b)

if, by virtue of a court decision, the right holder is not entitled to the design;

(c)

if the design is in conflict with a prior design which has been made available to the public after the date of filing of the application or, if a priority is claimed, the date of priority of the design, and which is protected from a data prior to the said date by a registered design or an application for a design;

(d)

if a distinctive sign is used in a subsequent design, and the law of the Party concerned governing that sign confers to the right holder of the sign, the right to prohibit such use;

if the design constitutes an unauthorised use of a work protected under the copyright law of the Party concerned;

(f)

if the design constitutes an improper use of any of the items listed in Article 6ter of the Paris Convention or of badges, emblems and escutcheons other than those covered by said Article 6ter and which are of particular public interest in a Party;

Article 263

Measures for preserving Evidence

The judicial authorities shall have the authority, on application by a party who has presented reasonably available evidence to support its claim that its intellectual property right has been or is about to be infringed, to order prompt and effective provisional measures to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the alleged infringement, subject to the protection of confidential information.

Article 264

Right of Information

The Parties may provide that the judicial authorities shall have the authority, unless this would be out of proportion to the seriousness of the infringement, to order the infringer to inform the right holder of the identity of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services and of their channels of distribution.

Article 265

Provisional and Precautionary Measures

1.   Each Party shall foresee that its judicial authorities have the authority to issue provisional and precautionary measures and execute them expeditiously to prevent imminent infringements of intellectual property rights or to forbid the continuation of alleged infringements. Such measures may be ordered at the request of the right-holder, inaudita altera parte or after hearing the defendant, in accordance with the judicial procedural rules of each Party.

2.   Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the plaintiff to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the plaintiff's right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the plaintiff to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures.

Article 266

Corrective Measures

1.   Each Party shall provide that:

(a)

its judicial authorities have the authority to order, at the request of the applicant and without prejudice to any damages due to the right holder by reason of the infringement, the destruction of the goods that have been found to be pirated or counterfeit, or other appropriate measures to definitively remove those goods from the channels of commerce;

(b)

its judicial authorities have the authority to order in appropriate cases that materials and implements that have been principally used in the manufacture or creation of such pirated or counterfeit goods be, without compensation of any sort, destroyed or, in exceptional circumstances, disposed of outside the channels of commerce, in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements. In considering requests for such corrective measures, the Party's judicial authorities may take into account, inter alia, the gravity of the infringement, as well as the interests of third parties holding ownership, possessory, contractual, or secured interests.

2.   Each Party may provide that the charitable donation of counterfeit trademark goods and goods that infringe copyright and related rights, if domestic legislation so permits, shall not be ordered by the judicial authorities without the authorisation of the right holder or that such goods may be donated to charity only under certain conditions that may be established according to domestic legislation. In no case shall the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed be sufficient to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce, except in cases established in domestic legislation and other international obligations.

3.   In considering requests for corrective measures, the Parties may grant their judicial authorities the faculty to take into account, inter alia, the gravity of the infringement, as well as the interests of third parties holding ownership, possessory, contractual, or secured interests.

4.   The judicial authorities shall order that those measures be carried out at the expense of the infringer, except in exceptional circumstances.

5.   According to domestic legislation, the Parties may provide for other corrective measures in relation to goods that have been found to be pirated or counterfeit, and with regard to materials and implements principally used in the creation or manufacture of those goods.

Article 267

Damages

The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person's intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity. In appropriate cases, the Parties may authorise the judicial authorities to order recovery of profits and/or payment of pre-established damages, even where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity.

Article 268

Legal Costs

The Parties shall ensure that reasonable and proportionate legal costs and other expenses incurred by the successful party shall, as a general rule, be borne by the unsuccessful party unless equity does not allow this, in accordance with domestic legislation.

Article 269

Publication of Judicial Decisions

The Parties may provide that, in legal proceedings instituted for infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities may order, at the request of the applicant and at the expense of the infringer, appropriate measures for the dissemination of the information concerning the decision, including displaying the decision and publishing it in full or in part. The Parties may provide for other additional publicity measures which are appropriate to the particular circumstances, including prominent advertising.

Article 270

Presumption of Ownership

For the purposes of applying the measures, procedures and remedies provided for under this Title, it shall be sufficient for the right holders of copyrights or related rights with regard to their protected subject matter, in the absence of proof to the contrary, for their name to appear on the work in the usual manner to be regarded as such and consequently to be entitled to institute infringement proceedings.

Article 271

Criminal Sanctions

The Parties shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. Remedies available shall include imprisonment and/or monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent, consistently with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a corresponding gravity. In appropriate cases, remedies available shall also include the seizure, forfeiture and destruction of the infringing goods and of any materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the commission of the offence. The Parties may provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in other cases of infringement of intellectual property rights, in particular where they are committed wilfully and on a commercial scale.

Article 272

Limitations on Liability for Service Providers

The Parties agree that they will maintain the type of limitations of responsibility of service providers they currently foresee in their respective legislation, namely:

(a)

for the EU Party: those foreseen in Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce;

(b)

for the Republics of the CA Party: those adopted domestically in order to comply with their international obligations.

A Party may delay giving effect to the provisions of this Article for a period of no longer than three years, beginning on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

Article 273

Border Measures

1.   The Parties recognise the importance of coordination on customs matters, and therefore engage to promote the application of customs enforcement in relation to counterfeit trademark and pirated copyright goods, specifically through the exchange of information and coordination between the customs administrations of the Parties.

2.   The Parties shall, unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter, adopt procedures to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for suspecting that the importation, exportation, re-exportation, entry or exit of the customs territory, placement under a suspensive procedure or placement under a free zone or a free warehouse of goods infringing trademarks, or copyrights may take place, to lodge an application in writing before the competent administrative or judicial authorities, for the suspension by the customs authorities of the release into free circulation or the detention of such goods. It is understood that there shall be no obligation to apply such procedures to imports of goods put on the market in another country by or with the consent of the right holder.

3.   Any rights or duties established in Section 4 of the TRIPS Agreement concerning the importer shall be also applicable to the exporter or to the holder of the goods.

4.   Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio in the cases of import, export and transit.

CHAPTER 4

Institutional provisions

Article 278

Principles

1.   The Parties recognise the importance of free and undistorted competition in their trade relations. The Parties acknowledge that anti-competitive practices have the potential to affect the proper functioning of markets and the benefits of trade liberalisation.

2.   The Parties therefore agree that the following are incompatible with this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Parties:

(a)

agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings, which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition (40) as specified in their respective competition laws;

(b)

any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position or a substantial market power or notable market participation, as specified in their respective competition laws; and

(c)

concentrations between undertakings, which significantly impede effective competition, as specified in their respective competition laws.

Article 279

Implementation

1.   The Parties shall adopt or maintain in force comprehensive competition laws which effectively address the anti-competitive practices referred to in Article 278, paragraph 2(a) to (c). The Parties shall establish or maintain Competition Authorities designated and appropriately equipped for the transparent and effective implementation of the competition laws.

2.   If, at the moment of entry into force of this Agreement, either Party has not yet adopted competition laws as referred to in Article 277, paragraph 1(a) or (b) nor designated a competition authority as referred to in Article 277, paragraph 2(a) or (b), it shall do so within a period of seven years. When this transition period has come to an end, the terms competition laws and competition authority referred to in this Title shall only mean those defined in Article 277, paragraph 1(a) and 277, paragraph 1(b) and Article 277, paragraph 2(a) and 277, paragraph 2(b).

2.   The entities mentioned in paragraph 1 above shall be subject to competition laws insofar as the application of competition laws does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them by a Republic of the CA Party or by a Member State of the EU Party.

3.   The Parties shall ensure that from the date of entry into force of this Agreement no discrimination (41) is exercised by such entities regarding the conditions under which goods or services are purchased or sold, neither between natural or legal persons of either of the Parties, nor between goods originating from either of the Parties.

4.   Nothing in this Title shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties as set out under Title V (Government Procurement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

Article 281

Exchange of Non Confidential Information and Enforcement Cooperation

1.   With a view to facilitating the effective application of their respective competition laws, the competition authorities may exchange non-confidential information.

2.   The competition authority of one Party may request cooperation to the other Party's competition authority with respect to enforcement activities. This cooperation shall not prevent the Parties from taking autonomous decisions.

3.   Neither Party is required to communicate information to the other Party. In case a Party decides to communicate information, such Party may withhold the information if communication of such information is prohibited by the laws and regulations of the Party possessing the information or if it would be incompatible with its interests. A Party may require that information communicated pursuant to this Article be used subject to the terms and conditions it may specify.

Article 282

Cooperation and Technical Assistance

The Parties agree that it is in their common interest to promote technical assistance initiatives related to competition policy and law enforcement activities. This cooperation is addressed in Article 52 of Title VI (Economic and Trade Development) of Part III of this Agreement.

Each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws and policies provide for and encourage high levels of environmental and labour protection, appropriate to its social, environmental and economic conditions and consistent with the internationally recognised standards and agreements referred to in Articles 286 and 287 to which it is a party, and shall strive to improve those laws and policies, provided that they are not applied in a manner that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties or a disguised restriction on international trade.

Article 286

Multilateral Labour Standards and Agreements

1.   Recalling the 2006 Ministerial Declaration of the UN Economic and Social Council on Full Employment and Decent Work, the Parties recognise that full and productive employment and decent work for all, which encompass social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work and social dialogue, are key elements of sustainable development for all countries, and therefore a priority objective of international cooperation. In this context, the Parties reaffirm their will to promote the development of macroeconomic policies in a way that is conducive to full and productive employment and decent work for all, including men, women and young people, with full respect for fundamental principles and rights at work under conditions of equity, equality, security and dignity.

The Parties, in accordance with their obligations as members of the ILO, reaffirm their commitments to respect, promote, and realise in good faith and in accordance with the ILO Constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of the fundamental ILO Conventions, namely:

5.   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any Party of measures to implement the agreements referred to in this Article, provided that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade.

Article 288

Trade Favouring Sustainable Development

1.   The Parties reconfirm that trade should promote sustainable development in all its dimensions. In this context, they recognise the value of international cooperation in support of efforts to develop trade schemes and trade practices favouring sustainable development, and they agree to work together in the framework of Articles 288, 289 and 290 with the aim of developing collaborative approaches, as appropriate.

consider those situations in which the elimination or the reduction of obstacles to trade would benefit trade and sustainable development, taking into account, in particular, the interactions between environmental measures and market access;

(b)

facilitate and promote trade and foreign direct investment in environmental technologies and services, renewable-energy and energy-efficient products and services, including through addressing related non-tariff barriers;

Scientific Information

The Parties recognise the importance, when preparing and implementing measures aimed at protecting the environment or health and safety at work, of taking account of scientific and technical information, and relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations, while acknowledging that when there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, the lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as reason for postponing protective measures.

Article 294

Institutional and Monitoring Mechanism

1.   A Party may request consultations with another Party regarding any matter of mutual interest arising under this Title, by delivering a written request to the Contact Point of the other Party. In order to enable the Party receiving the request to respond, the request shall contain information that is specific enough to present the matter clearly and factually, by identifying the problem at issue and by providing a brief summary of the claims under this Title. Consultations shall commence promptly after a Party delivers a request for consultations.

2.   The consulting Parties shall make every attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution of the matter, taking into account the information exchanged by the consulting Parties and opportunities for cooperation on the matter. During consultations, special attention shall be given to the particular problems and interests of developing country Parties. The consulting Parties shall take into account the activities of the ILO or relevant multilateral environmental organisations or bodies to which they are parties. Where relevant, the consulting Parties may, by mutual agreement, seek advice or assistance from those organisations and bodies, or from any person or body they deem appropriate in order to fully examine the matter at issue.

3.   If ninety days after the request of consultations, a consulting Party deems that the matter needs further discussion, and unless the consulting Parties agree otherwise, the matter shall be referred for consideration to the Board on Trade and Sustainable Development by delivering a written request to the Contact Points of the other Parties. The Board on Trade and Sustainable Development shall convene promptly in order to assist in reaching a mutually satisfactory solution. If it deems necessary, the Board on Trade and Sustainable Development may seek expert assistance in the matter of interest, with the objective of facilitating its analysis.

4.   Any solution reached by the consulting Parties on the matter shall be made public unless the Board on Trade and Sustainable Development otherwise decides.

Article 297

Panel of Experts

1.   Unless the consulting Parties agree otherwise, a consulting Party may, after sixty days of the referral of a matter to the Board on Trade and Sustainable Development or, if the matter is not referred to the Board, after ninety days of the delivery of a request for consultation under Article 296, paragraphs 1 and 3 respectively, request that a Panel of Experts be convened to examine a matter that has not been satisfactorily addressed through government consultations. The Parties to the procedure can make submissions to the Panel of Experts.

2.   At the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall submit to the Association Committee for endorsement by the Council at its first meeting, a list of seventeen persons with at least five individuals who are not nationals of any Party, with expertise in environmental law, international trade or the resolution of disputes arising under international agreements; and a list of seventeen persons, with at least five individuals who are not nationals of any Party, with expertise in labour law, international trade or the resolution of disputes arising under international agreements. The experts who are not nationals of any Party would be available to serve as Chair of the Panel of Experts. The experts shall be (i) independent of, and not affiliated with or take instructions from, either Party or organisations represented in the Advisory Group(s); and (ii) chosen on the basis of objectivity, reliability and sound judgment.

3.   The Parties shall agree on replacements of experts who are no longer available to serve in panels, and they may otherwise agree to modify the list as and when they consider it necessary.

The two selected experts shall select the Chairperson by agreement or by lot, from among the experts who are not nationals of any Party.

4.   Individuals may not serve as experts with respect to a matter in which they, or an organisation to which they are affiliated, has a direct or indirect conflict of interests. Upon selection to serve as experts on a given matter, each expert is expected to disclose the existence or development of any interest, relationship or matter that that expert could reasonably be expected to know and that is likely to affect, or give rise to justifiable doubts as to that expert's independence or impartiality.

5.   If either Party to the procedure believes that an expert is in violation of the requirements set forth in paragraph 4, the Parties to the procedure shall promptly consult and, if they agree, the expert shall be removed and a new expert shall be selected in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 3 that were used to select the expert who was removed.

6.   Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties to the procedure in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 301, the Panel of Experts shall be established no later than sixty days of a Party's request.

TITLE IX

REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION

Article 303

General Provisions

1.   The Parties underline the importance of the region to region dimension and recognise the significance of regional economic integration in the context of this Agreement. They, accordingly, reaffirm their will to strengthen and deepen their respective regional economic integration processes, within the applicable frameworks.

2.   The Parties recognise that regional economic integration in the areas of customs procedures, technical regulations and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are essential for the free circulation of goods within Central America and the EU Party.

3.   Accordingly, and taking into account the different level of development of their respective regional economic integration processes, the Parties agree on the following provisions.

Article 304

Customs Procedures

1.   In the area of customs, no later than two years as from the entry into force of this Agreement, the custom authority of the Republic of the CA Party of first entry shall grant a reimbursement of the duty paid when such goods are exported into another Republic of the CA Party. Such goods shall be subject to the customs duty in the Republic of the CA Party of import.

2.   The Parties shall endeavour to put into place a mechanism that will ensure that goods originating in Central America or in the European Union in accordance with Annex II (Concerning the Definition of the Concept of "Originating Products" and Methods of Administrative Cooperation) to this Agreement, entering their respective territory and having been cleared at customs of import, may no longer be subject to customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect or to quantitative restrictions or measures having an equivalent effect.

3.   The Parties agree that their respective customs legislation and procedures shall provide for the use of a single administrative document or electronic equivalent in the EU Party and in the CA Party, respectively, for the purposes of establishing customs declarations at import and export. The CA Party commits to achieving this objective three years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

4.   The Parties shall also ensure that customs legislation, procedures and customs related requirements at import applicable to goods originating in Central America or in the European Union are harmonised at regional level. The CA Party commits to achieving this objective at the latest five years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

Article 305

Technical Barriers to Trade

1.   In the area of technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures:

(a)

the Parties agree that the Member States of the European Union will ensure that products originating in Central America which have been legally placed on the market of one Member State of the European Union, can also be marketed in the other Member States of the European Union, provided that the product provides an equivalent level of protection of the various legitimate interests involved (principle of mutual recognition);

(b)

in this respect, the Member States of the European Union will accept, provided that the product provides an equivalent level of protection of the various legitimate interests involved, that a product which has fulfilled the conformity assessment procedures required by one of the Member States of the European Union, can be placed on the market of the other Member States of the European Union, without having to undergo an additional conformity assessment procedure.

2.   When harmonised regional import requirements exist, products originating in the European Union should comply with the regional requirements in order to be legally marketed in the Republic of the CA Party of first import. In accordance with this Agreement, where a product is covered by harmonised legislation and a registration has to be carried out, the registration made in one of the Republics of the CA Party should be accepted by all the other Republics of the CA Party, once the internal procedures have been fulfilled.

3.   Furthermore, where registration is required, the Republics of the CA Party will accept that products should be registered by group or family of products.

4.   The CA Party agrees to adopt, within five years of the entry into force of this Agreement, the regional technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures that are currently in preparation and listed in Annex XX (List of Central American Technical Regulations (RTCA) in the Process of Harmonisation) to this Agreement, and to continue work towards the harmonisation of technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and to promote the development of regional standards.

5.   For products not yet harmonised in the CA Party and not included in Annex XX, the Association Committee will establish a work program to explore the possibility of including additional products in the future.

Article 306

Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures

1.   The aim of this Article is to:

(a)

promote conditions to allow goods subjected to sanitary and phytosanitary measures to freely move within Central America and the EU Party;

(b)

promote the harmonisation and improvement of sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and procedures in the CA Party and the EU Party, including to achieve the use of a single import certificate, a single list of establishments, a single sanitary import check and a single fee for products imported from the EU Party into the CA Party;

(c)

endeavour to ensure the mutual recognition of the verifications carried out by the Republics of the CA Party in any Member State of the European Union.

2.   The EU Party shall ensure that from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, animals, animal products, plants and plant products, lawfully put on the market, can freely move within the territory of the EU Party without checks at the internal borders, provided that they comply with the relevant sanitary and phytosanitary requirements.

3.   The CA Party shall ensure that from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, animals, animal products, plants and plant products shall benefit from regional transit facilitation in the territories of the CA Party in accordance with Resolution No. 219-2007 (COMIECO-XLVII) and subsequent related instruments. For the purposes of this Title, in case of imports from the EU Party, regional transit facilitation means that EU Party's goods may enter through any CA Party's border inspection post and may transit through the region, from one Republic of the CA Party to another, complying with the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of the Party of final destination, where a sanitary or phytosanitary inspection may be conducted.

4.   Provided that they comply with the relevant sanitary and phytosanitary requirements and in accordance with the existing mechanisms in the Central American regional integration process, the CA Party undertakes to grant animals, animal products, plants and plant products listed in Annex XIX (List of Products referred to in Paragraph 4 of Article 306), the following treatment: when imported into the territory of a Republic of the CA Party, the Competent Authorities will check the certificate issued by the Competent Authority of the EU Party, and may perform a sanitary or phytosanitary inspection; once clearance is provided, a product included in Annex XIX may only be subject to a random sanitary or phytosanitary inspection at the point of entry of the Republic of the CA Party of final destination.

For products included in List 1 of Annex XIX, the above obligation will apply no later than two years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

For products included in List 2 of Annex XIX, the above obligation will apply no later than five years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

5.   Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties (the EU Party or the Republics of the CA Party) under the WTO Agreement and the sanitary and phytosanitary procedures and requirements established by each Party, an importing Party should not be required to grant a more favourable treatment to products imported from the exporting Party than the treatment given by the exporting Party in its intra-regional trade.

6.   The Association Council may modify Annex XIX (List of Products referred to in Paragraph 4 of Article 306) following recommendations by the Sub-Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters to the Association Committee, in line with the procedure established in Title XIII (Specific Tasks in Trade Matters of the Bodies Established under this Agreement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

7.   The Sub-Committee mentioned in paragraph 6 shall closely monitor the implementation of this Article.

Article 307

Implementation

1.   The Parties recognise the importance of increased cooperation to achieve the objectives of this Title and to address this issue through the mechanisms foreseen in Title VI (Economic and Trade Development) of Part III of this Agreement.

2.   The Parties undertake to consult on issues related to this Title with the view to ensuring the effective implementation of the region to region dimension of this Agreement and the objectives of regional economic integration.

3.   The progress of the CA Party in the implementation of this Title shall be subject to regular progress reports and working programs by the CA Party covering Articles 304, 305 and 306. The progress reports and working programs shall be presented in writing and shall set out all steps taken towards implementation of obligations and objectives defined in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of Article 304, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 305 and paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 306, as well as the steps envisaged for the period prior to the next progress report. Progress reports and working programs shall be submitted every year until the commitments specified in this paragraph are effectively complied with.

4.   The Parties will consider the inclusion of further areas to this Title five years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

5.   The commitments on regional integration assumed by the CA Party under this Title are not subject to dispute settlement procedures under Title X (Dispute Settlement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

3.   Any Party entitled under paragraph 1 to request the establishment of a Panel, may join the Panel proceedings as a complaining Party upon submission of a written notice to the other disputing Parties. The notice shall be submitted no later than five days after the date of receipt of the initial request for the establishment of a Panel.

4.   The establishment of a Panel may not be requested to review a proposed measure.

2.   Within ten days of the date of the submission of the request for the establishment of a Panel, the disputing Parties shall consult in order to reach an agreement on the composition of the Panel (49).

3.   In the event that the disputing Parties are unable to agree on the composition of the Panel within the time period laid down in paragraph 2, each disputing Party will have the right to select one panelist, who will not act as Chair, among the individuals of the list established in Article 325, within three days following the expiration of the time period established in paragraph 2. The Chair of the Association Committee, or the Chair's delegate, will select the Chair-person and any remaining panelist by lot from the relevant individuals of the list established under Article 325.

4.   The Chair of the Association Committee, or the Chair's delegate, shall carry out the lot within five days of receipt of a request to do so from one or both disputing Parties.

2.   For purposes of compliance, the disputing Parties and, in any event the Panel, shall take into consideration the possible effects of the measure determined to be inconsistent with this Agreement on the level of development of the Party complained against.

3.   In the event that full and timely compliance with the Panel's ruling does not occur, compensation or suspension of obligations may be applied as temporary measures. In this event, the disputing Parties shall endeavour to agree on compensation rather than apply suspension of obligations. However, neither compensation nor suspension of obligations is preferred to full and timely implementation of the Panel's ruling.

4.   Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the CA Party as the complaining Party or the Party complained against, any compensation or suspension of obligations pursuant to this Title shall apply individually for each Republic of the CA Party, to which effect the Panel ruling shall individually determine the level of nullification or impairment caused by the violation for each Republic of the CA Party.

Article 315

2.   The disputing Parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time necessary to comply with the Panel ruling within thirty days after notification to the disputing Parties of said ruling. Where agreement is reached, the disputing Parties shall notify the Association Committee of the agreed reasonable period of time and, where possible, the specific measures that the Party complained against intends to adopt.

3.   Failing agreement between the disputing Parties on the reasonable period of time to comply with the Panel ruling within the time period established in paragraph 2, the complaining Party may request the original Panel to determine the reasonable period of time. Such request shall be made in writing and notified to the other disputing Party with copy to the Association Committee. The Panel shall notify its ruling to the disputing Parties with copy to the Association Committee within twenty days from the date of the submission of the request. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the CA Party, the Panel shall determine the reasonable period of time for each Republic of the CA Party.

4.   In the event of the original Panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the relevant procedures set out in Article 312 shall apply. The time limit for notifying the ruling shall be thirty five days from the date of the submission of the request referred to in paragraph 3.

5.   The Party complained against shall report to the Association Committee on measures taken and measures to be taken in order to comply with the Panel ruling. This report shall be in writing and shall be made no later than half way through the reasonable period of time.

The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party, with copy to the Association Committee, prior to the expiry of the reasonable period of time of any measure that it has taken to comply with the Panel ruling and provide the details such as the effective date, the relevant text of the measure and a factual and juridical explanation of how the measure taken to comply brings the Party complained against into compliance.

2.   In the event of disagreement between the disputing Parties concerning the existence or compatibility of any measure notified under paragraph 1 with the provisions referred to in Article 309, the complaining Party may request in writing the original Panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall identify the specific measure at issue and it shall explain how such measure is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 309. The Panel shall notify its ruling within forty five days of the date of the submission of the request. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the CA Party, the Panel shall, where necessary under the circumstances, issue its ruling pursuant to this Article for each Republic of the CA Party.

Article 317

Temporary Remedies in case of Non-Compliance

1.   If any Party complained against fails to notify any measure taken to comply with the Panel ruling prior to the expiry of the reasonable period of time, as established in Article 316, paragraph 1, or if the Panel rules that the measure notified under said Article 316, paragraph 1 is inconsistent with that Party's obligations under the provisions referred to in Article 309, the Party complained against shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, present an offer for compensation. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the CA Party, each of the Republics of the CA Party shall present or be presented with, as the case may be, an offer for compensation, taking account of the level of nullification or impairment determined pursuant to Article 314, paragraph 4, as well as any measure notified under Article 316, paragraph 1. The EU Party will endeavour to exercise due restraint when requesting compensation pursuant to this paragraph.

2.   If no agreement on compensation is reached within thirty days of the end of the reasonable period of time or of the notification of the Panel ruling under Article 316 that a measure taken to comply is inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 309, any complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the Party complained against with copy to the Association Committee, to suspend obligations arising from any provision referred to in Article 309 at a level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. The notification shall indicate the obligations that the complaining Party intends to suspend. The complaining Party may implement the suspension ten days after the date of the notification, unless the Party complained against has requested a ruling by a Panel under paragraph 3. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the CA Party, suspension of obligations shall be applied individually to each non compliant Republic of the CA Party or by each Republic of the CA Party as the case may be, taking account of the individual level of nullification or impairment determined pursuant to Article 314, paragraph 4, as well as any measure notified under Article 316, paragraph 1.

3.   If any Party complained against considers that the level of suspension is not equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation, it may request in writing the original Panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the complaining Party with copy to the Association Committee prior to the expiry of the ten day period referred to in paragraph 2. The Panel shall notify its ruling on the level of the suspension of obligations to the disputing Parties with copy to the Association Committee within thirty days of the date of the submission of the request. Obligations shall not be suspended until the Panel has notified its ruling, and any suspension shall be consistent with the Panel ruling.

4.   In the event of the original Panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the relevant procedures laid down in Article 312 shall apply. The time period for notifying the ruling shall be forty five days from the date of the submission of the request referred to in paragraph 3.

5.   When suspending benefits pursuant to paragraph 1, the EU Party will endeavour to exercise appropriate moderation, taking into consideration, among other factors, the likely impact on the economy and level of development of the Party complained against, and opt for measures conducive to bringing the Party complained against into compliance, and least likely to adversely affect the attainment of the objectives of this Agreement.

6.   The suspension of obligations shall be temporary and shall be applied only until any specific measure or measures found to be inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 309, has or have been brought into full conformity with those provisions, as established under Article 318, or until any of the disputing Parties have agreed to settle the dispute.

Article 318

Review of any Measure taken to Comply After the Suspension of Obligations

1.   The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party, with copy to the Association Committee, of any measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the Panel and of its request for a termination of the suspension of obligations applied by the complaining Party.

2.   If the disputing Parties fail to reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with the provisions referred to in Article 309, within thirty days of the date of the submission of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the complaining Party shall request in writing the original Panel to rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the Party complained against with copy to the Association Committee. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the CA Party, the Panel shall issue a ruling pursuant to this Article for each Republic of the CA Party. The Panel ruling shall be notified to the disputing Parties with copy to the Association Committee within forty five days of the date of the submission of the request. If the Panel rules that any measure taken to comply is in conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 309, the suspension of obligations shall be terminated.

3.   In the event of the original Panel, or some of its members, being unable to reconvene, the relevant procedures laid down in Article 312 shall apply. The time period for notifying the ruling shall be sixty days from the date of the submission of the request referred to in paragraph 2.

Article 326

Relation with WTO Obligations

1.   If a disputing Party seeks redress of a violation of an obligation under the WTO Understanding on the Rules and Procedures Governing Dispute Settlement (hereinafter referred to as "WTO DSU"), it shall have recourse to the relevant rules and procedures of the WTO Agreement.

2.   If a disputing Party seeks redress of a violation of an obligation under Part IV of this Agreement, it shall have recourse to the relevant rules and procedures of this Title.

3.   If a disputing Party seeks redress of a violation of an obligation under Part IV of this Agreement which at the same time implies a violation to the WTO Agreements, the Party shall have recourse to the forum of its selection.

4.   The disputing Parties shall avoid bringing identical disputes in different fora when based on the same legal claims and measures.

5.   In the case of non-identical disputes related to the same measure, the Parties shall refrain from initiating concurrent dispute settlement procedures.

6.   Where a disputing Party has initiated dispute settlement procedures under the WTO DSU or under this Title and subsequently seeks redress of a violation of an obligation under a second forum, based on a dispute which is identical to a dispute previously brought in the other forum, that Party shall be barred from bringing the second dispute. For the purpose of this Title, the term identical shall mean a dispute based on the same legal claims and measures challenged. A dispute shall not be considered to be identical where the forum initially selected has failed for procedural or jurisdictional reasons to make findings regarding the legal claim brought before it.

7.   For the purpose of the previous paragraph, a dispute settlement procedure will be deemed initiated under the WTO DSU, when the Panel is established in accordance to Article 6 of the WTO DSU, and under this Title, when a Party has requested the establishment of a Panel in accordance with Article 311, paragraph 1. Dispute settlement procedures under the WTO DSU are concluded when the Dispute Settlement Body adopts the Panel's report, or the Appellate Body's report, pursuant to Articles 16 and 17(14) of the WTO DSU. Dispute settlement procedures under this Title are concluded when the Panel notifies its ruling on the subject matter to the Parties and to the Association Committee pursuant to Article 313, paragraph 1.

8.   Any question about the jurisdiction of the panels established according to this Title, shall be raised within a period of time of ten days of the establishment of the Panel and shall be resolved through a preliminary ruling within thirty days from the Panel's establishment. Once a challenge to the jurisdiction of a Panel has been made under this Article, all time limits established in this Title and in the Rules of Procedure shall be suspended pending the notification of the Panel's preliminary ruling.

9.   Nothing in this Title shall preclude a disputing Party from implementing the suspension of obligations authorised by the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO. The WTO Agreement shall not be invoked to preclude a disputing Party from suspending obligations under this Title.

Article 327

Time Periods

1.   All time periods laid down in this Title and in the Rules of Procedure, including the time periods for the panels to notify their rulings, shall be counted in calendar days, the first day being the day following the act or fact to which they refer.

2.   Any time period referred to in this Title and in the Rules of Procedure may be modified by mutual agreement of the disputing Parties.

3.   The Panel may suspend its work at any time for a period not exceeding twelve months, at the request of the complaining Party and with the agreement of the Party complained against. In this case, the time periods shall be extended during the time that the procedure has been suspended. If the Panel procedure has been suspended for more than twelve months, the terms of reference of the Panel shall elapse, without prejudice of the complaining Party's right to request consultations and subsequently request the establishment of a Panel on the same matter at a later stage. This paragraph shall not apply where the suspension is the result of attempts in good faith at reaching a mutually satisfactory solution pursuant to Article 324.

Article 328

Adoption and Modification of the Rules of Procedure and the Code of Conduct

1.   The Association Council shall adopt the Rules of Procedure and the Code of Conduct during its first meeting.

2.   The Association Council may modify the Rules of Procedure and the Code of Conduct.
