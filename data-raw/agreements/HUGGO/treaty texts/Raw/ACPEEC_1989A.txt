WHO, having exchanged their full powers, found in good and due form,

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

PART ONE

GENERAL PROVISIONS OF ACP-EEC COOPERATION

Chapter 1 Objectives and principles of cooperation

Article 1

The Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the ACP States, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as the 'Contracting Parties`), hereby conclude this cooperation Convention in order to promote and expedite the economic, cultural and social development of the ACP States and to consolidate and diversify their relations in a spirit of solidarity and mutual interest.

The Contracting Parties thereby affirm their undertaking to continue, strengthen and render more effective the system of cooperation established under the first, second and third ACP-EEC Conventions and confirm the special character of their relations, based on their reciprocal interest, and the specific nature of their cooperation.

The Contracting Parties hereby express their resolve to intensify their effort to create, with a view to a more just and balanced international economic order, a model for relations between developed and developing states and to work together to affirm in the international context the principles underlying their cooperation.

Article 2

ACP-EEC cooperation, underpinned by a legally binding system and the existence of joint institutions, shall be exercised on the basis of the following fundamental principles:

- equality between partners, respect for their sovereignty, mutual interest and interdependence,

-the right of each State to determine its own political, social, cultural and economic policy options,

-security of their relations based on the acquis of their system of cooperation.

Article 3

The ACP States shall determine the development principles, strategies and models for their economies and societies in all sovereignty.

Article 4

Support shall be provided in ACP-EEC cooperation for the ACP States' efforts to achieve comprehensive self-reliant and self-sustained development based on their cultural and social values, their human capacities, their natural resources and their economic potential in order to promote the ACP States' social, cultural and economic progress and the well-being of their populations through the satisfaction of their basic needs, the recognition of the role of women and the enhancement of people's capacities, with respect for their dignity.

Such development shall be based on a sustainable balance between its economic objectives, the rational management of the environment and the enhancement of natural and human resources.

Article 5

1. Cooperation shall be directed towards development centred on man, the main protagonist and beneficiary of development, which thus entails respect for and promotion of all human rights. Cooperation operations shall thus be conceived in accordance with the positive approach, where respect for human rights is recognized as a basic factor of real development and where cooperation is conceived as a contribution to the promotion of these rights.

In this context development policy and cooperation are closely linked with the respect for and enjoyment of fundamental human rights. The role and potential of initiatives taken by individuals and groups shall also be recognized and fostered in order to achieve in practice real participation of the population in the development process in accordance with Article 13.

2. Hence the Parties reiterate their deep attachment to human dignity and human rights, which are legitimate aspirations of individuals and peoples. The rights in question are all human rights, the various categories thereof being indivisible and inter-related, each having its own legitimacy: non-discriminatory treatment; fundamental human rights; civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights.

Every individual shall have the right, in his own country or in a host country, to respect for his dignity and protection by the law.

ACP-EEC cooperation shall help abolish the obstacles preventing individuals and peoples from actually enjoying to the full their economic, social and cultural rights and this must be achieved through the development which is essential to their dignity, their well-being and their self-fulfilment. To this end, the Parties shall strive, jointly or each in its own sphere of responsibility, to help eliminate the causes of situations of misery unworthy of the human condition and of deep-rooted economic and social inequalities.

The Contracting Parties hereby reaffirm their existing obligations and commitment in international law to strive to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on ethnic group, origin, race, nationality, colour, sex, language, religion or any other situation. This commitment applies more particularly to any situation in the ACP States or in the Community that may adversely affect the pursuit of the objectives of the Convention, and to the system of apartheid, having regard also to its destabilizing effects on the outside. The Member States (and/or, where appropriate, the Community itself) and the ACP States will continue to ensure, through the legal or administrative measures which they have or will have adopted, that migrant workers, students and other foreign nationals legally within their territory are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of racial, religious, cultural or social differences, notably in respect of housing, education, health care, other social services and employment.

3. At the request of the ACP States, financial resources may be allocated, in accordance with the rules governing development finance cooperation, to the promotion of human rights in the ACP States through specific schemes, public or private, that would be decided, particularly in the legal sphere, in consultation with bodies of internationally recognized competence in the field. Resources may also be given to support the establishment of structures to promote human rights. Priority shall be given to schemes of regional scope.

Article 6

1. With a view to attaining more balanced and self-reliant economic development in the ACP States, special efforts shall be made under this Convention to promote rural development, food security for the people, rational management of natural resources, and the preservation, revival and strengthening of agricultural production potential in the ACP States.

2. The Contracting Parties recognize that priority must be given to environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources, which are essential conditions for sustainable and balanced development from both the economic and human viewpoints.

Article 7

The Community and the ACP States shall give special importance and high priority to regional cooperation and integration. In this context, the Convention shall offer effective support for the ACP States' efforts to organize themselves into regional groupings and to step up their cooperation at regional and inter-regional level with a view to promoting a new, more just and more balanced economic order.

Article 8

The Contracting Parties acknowledge the need to accord special treatment to the least-developed ACP States and to take account of the specific difficulties confronting the landlocked and island ACP States. They shall pay special attention to improving the living conditions of the poorest sections of the population.

Cooperation shall comprise, inter alia, special treatment when determining the volume of financial resources and the conditions attached thereto in order to enable the least-developed ACP States to overcome structural and other obstacles to their development.

For the landlocked and island ACP States, cooperation shall be aimed at devising and encouraging specific operations to deal with development problems caused by their geographical situations.

Article 9

In order to step up the effectiveness of the instruments of this Convention, the Contracting Parties shall adopt, in the framework of their respective responsibilities, guidelines, priorities and measures conducive to attaining the objectives set out in this Convention and agree to pursue, in accordance with the principles set out in Article 2, the dialogue within joint institutions and in the coordinated implementation of development finance cooperation and the other cooperation instruments.

Article 10

The Contracting Parties shall, each as far as it is concerned in the framework of this Convention, take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising from this Convention and to facilitate the pursuit of its objectives. They shall refrain from any measures liable to jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of this Convention.

Article 11

Within the scope of their respective responsibilities, the institutions of this Convention shall examine periodically the results of the application thereof, provide any necessary impetus and take any relevant decision or measure for the attainment of its objectives.

Any question that might directly hamper the effective attainment of the objectives of this Convention may be raised in the context of the institutions.

Consultations shall take place within the Council of Ministers at the request of either Contracting Party in cases provided for in this Convention or where difficulties arise with the application or interpretation thereof.

Article 12

Where the Community intends, in the exercise of its powers, to take a measure which might affect the interests of the ACP States as far as this Convention's objectives are concerned, it shall inform in good time the said States of its intentions. Towards this end, the Commission shall communicate regularly to the Secretariat of the ACP States any proposals for such measures. Where necessary, a request for information may also take place on the initiative of the ACP States.

At their request, consultations shall be held in good time so that account may be taken of their concerns as to the impact of those measures before any final decision is made.

After such consultations have taken place, the ACP States shall also be provided with adequate information on the entry into force of such decisions, in advance whenever possible.

Chapter 2 Objectives and guidelines of the Convention in the main areas of cooperation

Article 13

Cooperation shall be aimed at supporting development in the ACP States, a process centred on man himself and rooted in each people's culture. It shall back up the policies and measures adopted by those States to enhance their human resources, increase their own creative capacities and promote their cultural identities. Cooperation shall also encourage participation by the population in the design and execution of development operations.

Account shall be taken, in the various fields of cooperation, and at all the different stages of the operations executed, of the cultural dimension and social implications of such operations and of the need for both men and women to participate and benefit on equal terms.

Article 14

Cooperation shall entail mutual responsibility for preservation of the natural heritage. In particular, it shall attach special importance to environmental protection and the preservation and restoration of natural equilibria in the ACP States. Cooperation schemes in all areas shall therefore be designed to make the objectives of economic growth compatible with development that respects natural equilibria and brings about lasting results in the service of man.

In the framework of efforts to protect the environment and restore natural blances, cooperation shall help promote specific operations concerning the conservation of natural resources, renewable and non-renewable, the protection of ecosystems and the control of drought, desertification and deforestation; other operations on specific themes shall also be undertaken (notably locust control, the protection and utilization of water resources, the preservation of tropical forests and biological diversity, the promotion of a better balance between urban and rural areas, and the urban environment).

Article 15

Agricultural cooperation shall be aimed at the pursuit of food self-sufficiency and food security in the ACP States, developing and organizing their productive systems, improving the living standards and conditions and the life-styles of the rural population and achieving the balanced development of rural areas.

Operations in this field shall be designed and executed to support the agricultural and food policies or strategies adopted by the ACP States.

Article 16

Cooperation in the field of mining and energy shall be directed at promoting and expediting, in the mutual interest, diversified economic development, deriving full benefit from the ACP States' human potential and natural resources, and at fostering better integration of these and other sectors and their complementarity with the rest of the economy.

Cooperation shall be aimed at creating and consolidating the cultural, social and economic environment and the infrastructure required to achieve that objective.

Support shall be provided for the ACP States' efforts to devise and implement energy policies suited to their situation, notably the gradual reduction of the dependence of the majority of them on imported petroleum products and the development of new and renewable sources of energy.

Cooperation shall be aimed at encouraging improved exploitation of energy and mining resources by taking account of the energy component in the development of the different economic and social sectors and thus helping to improve living conditions and the environment, leading to the better conservation of biomass resources, particularly fuelwood.

Article 17

The Community and the ACP States acknowledge that industrialization is a driving force - complementary to agricultural and rural development - in promoting the economic transformation of the ACP States in order to achieve self-sustained growth and balanced and diversified development. Industrial development is needed to enhance the productivity of the ACP economies so that they can meet basic human needs and step up the competitive participation of the ACP States in world trade by way of selling more value-added products.

Article 18

Given the extreme dependence of the economies of the vast majority of ACP States on their export of commodities, the Contracting Parties agree to pay particular attention to their cooperation in this sector with a view to supporting ACP States' policies or strategies designed:

- on the one hand, to foster diversification, both horizontal and vertical, of the ACP economies, in particular through the development of processing, marketing, distribution and transport (PMDT), and

-on the other hand, to improve the competitiveness of the ACP States' commodities on world markets through the reorganization and rationalization of their production, marketing and distribution activities.

Article 19

The aim of cooperation in fisheries shall be to help the ACP States to develop their fishery resources in order to expand production for domestic consumption as part of their efforts to achieve increased food security and increase production for export. Such cooperation shall be designed to serve the mutual interests of the Parties, in accordance with their fishery policies.

Chapter 3 Widening participation in cooperation activities

Article 20

In accordance with Articles 2, 3 and 13 and in order to encourage all parties from the ACP States and the Community which are in a position to contribute to the autonomous development of the ACP States to put forward and implement initiatives, cooperation shall also support, within limits laid down by the ACP States concerned, development operations put forward by economic, social and cultural organizations in the framework of decentralized cooperation, in particular where they combine the efforts and resources of organizations from the ACP States and their counterparts from the Community. This form of cooperation shall be aimed in particular at making the capabilities, original operating methods and resources of such parties available to the development of the ACP States.

The parties referred to in this Article are decentralized public authorities, rural and village groupings, cooperatives, firms, trade unions, teaching and research centres, non-governmental development organizations, various associations and all groups and parties which are able and wish to make their own spontaneous and original contribution to the development of ACP States.

Article 21

Cooperation shall encourage and support the initiatives of the ACP parties referred to in Article 20, provided they correspond with the priorities, guidelines and development methods adopted by the ACP States. In this framework, cooperation shall support either the independent activities of ACP parties or the activities of ACP parties which are combined with support from similar parties from the Community which make their capabilities, experience, technological and organizational capacities or financial resources available to them.

Cooperation shall encourage parties from the ACP States and the Community to provide supplementary financial and technical resources for the development effort. Cooperation may provide decentralized cooperation operations with financial and/or technical support drawn from the resources of the Convention under the conditions laid down in Article 22.

This form of cooperation shall be organized in accordance with the role and the prerogatives of the public authorities of the ACP States.

Article 22

Decentralized cooperation operations may be supported through the instruments of development finance cooperation, with the approval of the ACP States concerned, preferably from the programming stage, of the principle of and the conditions for providing support for this form of copperation. Such support shall be provided to the extent to which it is necessary for the successful implementation of the proposed operations provided the usefulness of the latter has been recognized and in accordance with the provisions for development finance cooperation. Projects under this form of cooperation may be linked, or not, with programmes in the concentration sectors of the indicative programmes with a priority for those linked to the concentration sectors.

Chapter 4 Principles governing the instruments of cooperation Article 23

In order to contribute towards achieving the aims of this Convention, the Contracting Parties shall deploy cooperation instruments that correspond to the principles of solidarity and mutual interest, adapted to the economic, cultural and social situation in the ACP States and in the Community and to developments in their international environment.

These instruments shall be directed mainly, by strengthening the established mechanisms and systems, at:

- increasing trade between the Parties,

-supporting the ACP States' efforts to achieve self-reliant development by stepping up their capacity to innovate and to adapt and transform technology,

-supporting the ACP States' structural adjustment efforts and thus contributing to the attenuation of the debt burden,

-helping the ACP States to gain access to the capital markets and encouraging direct private European investment to contribute towards the development of the ACP States,

- remedying the instability of export earnings from the ACP States' agricultural commodities and helping those countries to cope with serious disruptions affecting their mining industries.

Article 24

In order to promote and diversify trade between the Contracting Parties, the Community and the ACP States are agreed on:

- general trade provisions,

-special arrangements for Community import of certain ACP products,

-arrangements to promote the development of the ACP States' trade and services, including tourism,

-a system of reciprocal information and consultation designed to help apply the trade cooperation provisions of this Convention effectively.

Article 25

The aim of the general trade arrangements, which are based on the Contracting Parties' international obligations, shall be to provide a firm and solid foundation for trade cooperation between the ACP States and the Community.

They shall be based on the principle of free access to the Community market for products originating in the ACP States, with special provisions for agricultural products and a safeguard clause.

In view of the ACP States' present development needs, the arrangements shall not comprise any element of reciprocity for those States as regards free access.

They shall also be based on the principle of non-discrimination by the ACP States between the Member States and the according to the Community of treatment no less favourable than the most-favoured-nation treatment.

Article 26

The Community shall contribute towards the ACP States' own development efforts by providing adequate financial resources and appropriate technical assistance aimed at stepping up those States' capacities for self-reliant and integrated economic, social and cultural development and also at helping to raise their populations' standard of living and well-being, and promote and mobilize resources in support of sustainable, effective and growth-oriented structural adjustment programmes.

Such contributions shall be made on a more predictable and continuous basis. They shall be provided at very highly concessional terms. Particular account shall be taken of the situation of the least-developed ACP States.

Article 27

The Contracting Parties agree to facilitate greater, more stable flows of resources from the private sector to the ACP States by taking measures to improve the access of ACP States to capital markets and to encourage European private investment in ACP States.

The Contracting Parties underline the need to promote, protect, finance and support investment and to provide equitable and stable conditions for the treatment of such investment.

Article 28

The Contracting Parties agree to confirm the importance of the system for the stabilization of export earnings, as well as of intensifying the process of consultation between the ACP States and the Community in international fora and organizations which aim to stabilize agricultural commodity markets.

Given the role played by the mining industry in the development efforts of numerous ACP States and the ACP-EEC mutual dependence in that sector, the Contracting Parties confirm the importance of the system established to help ACP States confronted with serious disruptions in that sector to restore it to a viable state and remedy the consequences of such disruptions for their development.

PART TWO

THE AREAS OF ACP-EEC COOPERATION

TITLE I

ENVIRONMENT

Article 33

In the framework of this Convention, the protection and the enhancement of the environment and natural resources, the halting of the deterioration of land and forests, the restoration of ecological balances, the preservation of natural resources and their rational exploitation are basic objectives that the ACP States concerned shall strive to achieve with Community support with a view to bringing an immediate improvement in the living conditions of their populations and to safeguarding those of future generations.

Article 34

The ACP States and the Community recognize that the existence of some ACP States is under threat as a result of a rapid deterioration of the environment that hinders any development efforts, in particular those aimed at achieving the priority objectives of food self-sufficiency and food security.

For many ACP States efforts to halt this deterioration of the environment and conserve natural resources are imperative and call for the preparation and implementation of coherent modes of development that have due regard for ecological balances.

Article 35

The dimension of the environmental problem and of the means to be deployed mean that operations will have to be carried out in the context of overall, long-term policies, drawn up and implemented by the ACP States at national, regional and international level with international support.

To this end, the Parties agree to give priority in their activities to:

- a preventive approach aimed at avoiding harmful effects on the environment as a result of any programme or operation,

-a systematic approach that will ensure ecological viability at all stages, from identification to implementation,

-a trans-sectoral approach that takes into account not only the direct but also the indirect consequences of the operations undertaken.

Article 36

The protection of the environment and natural resources requires a comprehensive approach embracing the social and cultural dimensions.

In order to ensure that this specific dimension shall be taken into account, attention shall be given to incorporating suitable educational, training, information and research schemes in projects and programmes.

Article 37

Cooperation instruments appropriate to environmental needs shall be designed and implemented.

Where necessary, both qualitative and quantitative criteria may be used. Jointly approved check-lists shall be used to help estimate the environmental viability of proposed operations, whatever their scale. Environmental impact assessment will be carried out as appropriate in the case of large-scale projects and those posing a significant threat to the environment.

For the proper integration of environmental considerations, physical inventories, where possible translated into accounting terms, shall be drawn up.

The implementation of these instruments has to ensure that, should an adverse environmental impact be foreseen, the necessary corrective measures are formulated in the early stage of the preparation of the proposed project or programme so that it can go ahead in accordance with the planned timetable though improved in terms of environmental and natural resource protection.

Article 38

The Parties, desirous of bringing real protection and effective management to the environment and natural resources, consider that the areas of ACP-EEC cooperation covered in Part Two of this Convention shall be systematically examined and appraised in this light.

In this spirit the Community shall support efforts made by the ACP States at national, regional and international level and also operations mounted by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in furtherance of national and intergovernmental policies and priorities.

Article 39

1. The Contracting Parties undertake, for their part, to make every effort to ensure that international movements of hazardous waste and radioactive waste are generally controlled, and they emphasize the importance of efficient international cooperation in this area.

With this in view, the Community shall prohibit all direct or indirect export of such waste to the ACP States while at the same time the ACP States shall prohibit the direct or indirect import into their territory of such waste from the Community or from any other country, without prejudice to specific international undertakings to which the Contracting Parties have subscribed or may subscribe in the future in these two areas within the competent international fora.

These provisions do not prevent a Member State to which an ACP State has chosen to export waste for processing from returning the processed waste to the ACP State of origin.

The Contracting Parties shall expedite adoption of the necessary internal legislation and administrative regulations to implement this undertaking. At the request of one of the Parties, consultations may be held if delays are encountered. At the conclusion of such consultations each Party may take appropriate steps in the light of the situation.

2. The Parties undertake to monitor strictly the implementation of the prohibition measures referred to in the second paragraph of paragraph 1. Should difficulties arise in this respect, consultations may be held subject to the same conditions as those provided for in the second paragraph of paragraph 1 and with the same effect.

3. The term 'hazardous waste` within the meaning of this Article shall cover categories of products listed in Annexes 1 and 2 to the Basle Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal.

As regards radioactive waste, the applicable definitions and thresholds shall be those which will be laid down in the framework of the IAEA. In the meantime, the said definitions and thresholds shall be those specified in the declaration in Annex VIII to this Convention.

Article 40

At the request of the ACP States, the Community shall provide available technical information on pesticides and other chemical products with a view to helping them develop or reinforce a suitable and safe use of these products.

Where necessary and in accordance with the provisions for development finance cooperation, technical assistance can be given in order to ensure conditions of safety at all stages, from production to disposal of such products.

Article 41

The Parties recognize the value of exchanging views, using existing consultation mechanisms under this Convention, on major ecological hazards, whether on a planetary scale (such as the greenhouse effect, the deterioration of the ozone layer, tropical forests, etc.), or of a more specific scope resulting from the application of industrial technology. Such consultations may be requested by either Party, insofar as these hazards may in practice affect the Contracting Parties, and will be aimed at assessing the scope for joint action to be undertaken within the terms of this Convention. If necessary, the consultations will also provide for an exchange of views prior to discussions conducted on these subjects in the appropriate international fora.

Chapter 2

Drought and desertification control

Article 54

The ACP States and the Community recognize that certain ACP States are facing considerable difficulties as a result of endemic drought and growing desertification, which hold back all efforts at development, in particular those aimed at achieving the priority objective of food self-sufficiency and food security.

The two Parties agree that in a number of ACP States control of drought and desertification constitutes a major challenge on which depends the success of their development policy.

Article 55

The correction of this situation and the sustainable development of the countries affected or threatened by such disasters require a policy encouraging the restoration of the natural environment and of the balance between resources and the human and animal population, in particular through such means as improved harnessing and management of water resources, appropriate agriculture, agroforestry and reafforestation schemes and control of the causes of desertification as well as of practices that engender it.

Article 56

If a return to the natural balance is to be expedited, a drought and desertification control component in particular must be incorporated into all agricultural and rural development operations, such as:

1. - the extension of agroforestry systems combining farming and forestry, research and development activities to produce plant species that are more adapted to local conditions,

-the introduction of suitable techniques aimed at increasing and maintaining the productivity of agricultural land, arable land and natural pastureland with a view to controlling the various forms of erosion,

-the reclamation of land that has deteriorated, by means of reafforestation or agricultural-land improvement, combined with maintenance schemes involving, as far as possible, the people and authorities concerned in order to safeguard the progress made;

2.the encouragement of measures to economize on wood as an energy source by stepping up research into, application of and information on new and renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar and biomass energy, and by the use of improved stoves with a greater heat yield;

3.the rational development and management of forestry resources by setting up at national or regional level, forestry management plans aimed at optimizing the exploitation of forestry resources;

4.the pursuit of ongoing campaigns to educate the people concerned to be aware of the phenomena of drought and desertification and to train them in the possible ways of controlling them;

5.an overall coordinated approach which, as a result of schemes such as those referred to in points 1 to 4, seeks to ensure the restoration of a suitable ecological balance between natural resources and the human and animal population, without prejudicing the objective of harmonious economic and social development.

Article 57

The operations to be undertaken, where necessary with research backing, shall cover, inter alia:

1. improving man's knowledge of, and ability to forecast, desertification phenomena by observing developments in the field, by means, inter alia, of modern technologies such as remote sensing, by making use of results achieved and gaining a better understanding of the changes to the human environment in time and space;

2.making an inventory of water-tables and of their replenishment capacity with a view to better predictability of water supplies, using surface and ground water and improving management of these resources, in particular by means of dams or other appropriate developments for the purpose of satisfying the needs of people and animals, and improving weather forecasting;

3.establishing a system for the prevention and control of bush fires and deforestation.

TITLE III

DEVELOPMENT OF FISHERIES

Article 58

The ACP States and the Community recognize the urgent need to promote the development of fishery resources of ACP States both as a contribution towards the development of fisheries as a whole and as a sphere of mutual interest for their respective economic sectors.

Cooperation in this field shall promote the optimum utilization of the fishery resources of ACP States, while recognizing the rights of landlocked States to participate in the exploitation of sea fisheries and the right of coastal States to exercise jurisdiction over the living marine resources of their exclusive economic zones in conformity with current international law and notably the conclusions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.

Article 59

To encourage the development of the exploitation of the fishery resources of the ACP States, all the mechanisms for assistance and cooperation provided for in this Convention, notably financial and technical assistance in accordance with the terms set out in Title III, Part Three shall be applied to fisheries.

The priority objectives of such cooperation shall be to:

- improve knowledge of the fisheries environment and its resources,

Article 160

1. In order to improve its impact and effectiveness, regional cooperation shall be programmed for each region at the beginning of the period covered by the Convention.

The programming, with the participation of the ACP States, shall be based on an appropriation fixed at the outset for each region and shall be the result of an exchange of views between all the national authorizing officers in the region concerned, or a regional organization which they have mandated to represent them, the Commission and its delegates:

(a) The aim of this programming shall, in accordance with Article 156 (2), be to draw up a programme specifying:

- the focal sectors for Community aid,

-the most appropriate measures and operations to achieve the objectives set for those sectors,

-the projects and programmes enabling those objectives to be attained, in so far as they have been clearly identified.

(b) The exchange of views organized for the purpose of programming shall continue for the purposes of implementation and follow-up; to that end, the national authorizing officers of the region concerned or a regional organization which they have mandated to represent them, the Commission and its delegates, and those in charge of regional projects and programmes shall meet, as a general rule, once a year to ensure that regional programmes are correctly implemented.

2. Account being taken of the objectives and inherent characteristics of regional cooperation, projects and programmes undertaken in this sphere shall be governed by the arrangements and procedures established for development finance cooperation where they apply to that context.

Article 161

1. Regional organizations duly mandated by the ACP States concerned must play an important part in the design and implementation of regional programmes.

2. They may take part in the programming exercise and in the implementation and management of regional programmes and projects.

3. Where an operation is financed by the Community through a regional cooperation body, the financing terms applicable to the final beneficiaries shall be agreed between the Community and that body in agreement with the ACP State or States concerned.

Article 162

A regional operation is one which helps directly to solve a development problem common to two or more countries through joint schemes or coordinated national schemes and which meets at least one of the following criteria:

(a) because of its nature or physical characteristics, it necessarily extends beyond the frontiers of one ACP State and cannot be carried out by a single country nor be divided up into national operations to be undertaken by each State on its own account;

(b) the regional formula makes it possible to achieve significant economies of scale in relation to national operations;

(c) the operation is the regional, inter-regional or intra-ACP expression of a sectoral or a global strategy;

(d) the accompanying costs and benefits are unequally shared out among the beneficiary countries.

Article 163

The Community's contribution under regional cooperation shall, in respect of operations which could be undertaken partly at national level, be determined on the basis of the following factors:

(a) the operation strengthens cooperation between the ACP States concerned at the level of authorities, institutions or enterprises, or through regional bodies or by removing obstacles, whether in the form or regulations or financial;

(b) two or more States have entered into mutual commitments in respect of an operation, notably as regards the distribution of facilities, investment and the running thereof.

Article 164

1. The requests for financing from funds earmarked for regional cooperation shall be governed by the following general procedures:

(a) requests for financing shall be presented by each of the ACP States participating in a regional operation;

(b) wherever an operation of regional cooperation is such as to be of interest to other ACP States, the Commission shall, in agreement with other applicant States, inform the other ACP States or, if need be, all the ACP States. The ACP States interested shall then confirm whether they intend to participate.

Notwithstanding this procedure, the Commission shall examine without delay any request for financing as long as it has been presented by at least two ACP States. The financing decision shall be taken after the States consulted have communicated their intention;

(c) where a single ACP State is associated with non-ACP countries, as provided for in Article 157, its request alone shall suffice;

(d) request for financing for intra-ACP regional cooperation schemes may be submitted by the ACP Council of Ministers, or, by specific delegation, by the ACP Committee of Ambassadors;

(e) regional cooperation bodies may present requests for the financing of one or more specific regional cooperation schemes on behalf, and with the explicit agreement, of those of their members that are ACP States;

(f) each request for regional cooperation funding must include, where necessary, proposals concerning:

(i) the ownership of the goods and services to be financed as part of the operation, and the division of responsibilities for operation and maintenance;

(ii) the choice of the regional authorizing officer and the State or body authorized to sign the financing agreement on behalf of all the participating ACP States or bodies. 2. The indicative programme for each region may lay down appropriate arrangements for the submission of requests.

3. The ACP State or States or regional bodies participating in a regional operation with third countries as provided for in Article 157 may request the Community to finance that part of the operation for which they are responsible or a part in proportion to the benefits they derive from the operation.

Article 165

1. With a view to encouraging regional cooperation between the least-developed, landlocked and island countries, particular attention shall be paid to these countries' specific problems at the regional programming stage and in the implementation.

2. As regards financing, the least-developed ACP States shall be given priority in any project involving at least one ACP State in that category, while special attention shall be paid to the landlocked and island ACP States in order to overcome the obstacles holding back their development.

Article 166

For the purposes set out in the present Title, the amount of the Community's financial assistance is provided for in Article 3 of the Financial Protocol to this Convention.

PART THREE

THE INSTRUMENTS OF ACP-EEC COOPERATION

TITLE I

TRADE COOPERATION

Chapter 1

General trade arrangements

Article 167

1. In the field of trade cooperation, the object of this Convention is to promote trade between the ACP States and the Community, taking account of their respective levels of development, and also between the ACP States themselves.

2. In the pursuit of this objective, particular regard shall be had to securing effective additional advantages for ACP States' trade with the Community and to improving the conditions of access for their products to the market in order to accelerate the growth of their trade and, in particular, of the flow of their exports to the Community and to ensure a better balance in the trade of the Contracting Parties.

3. To this end, the Contracting Parties shall apply the provisions of this Title and the other appropriate measures under Title III of this Part and under Part Two of this Convention.

Article 168

1. Products originating in the ACP States shall be imported into the Community free of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect.

2. (a) Products originating in the ACP States:

- listed in Annex II to the Treaty where they come under a common organization of the market within the meaning of Article 40 of the Treaty, or

-subject, on import into the Community, to specific rules introduced as a result of the implementation of the common agricultural policy

shall be imported into the Community, notwithstanding the general arrangements applied in respect of third countries, in accordance with the following provisions:

(i) those products shall be imported free of customs duties for which Community provisions in force at the time of import do not provide, apart from customs duties, for the application of any measure relating to their import;

(ii) for products other than those referred to in point (i), the Community shall take the necessary measures to ensure more favourable treatment than that granted to third countries benefiting from the most-favoured-nation clause for the same products.

(b) If, during the application of this Convention, the ACP States request that new lines of agricultural production or agricultural products which are not the subject of specific arrangements when this Convention enters into force should benefit from such arrangements, the Community shall examine these requests in consultation with the ACP States.

(c) Notwithstanding the above, the Community shall, in the context of the special relations and special nature of ACP-EEC cooperation, examine on a case-by-case basis the requests from the ACP States for preferential access for their agricultural products to the Community market and shall notify its decision on these reasoned requests if possible within four months, and in any case not more than six months after the date of their submission.

Within the context of subparagraph (a) (ii), the Community shall take its decisions in particular with reference to concessions granted to developing third countries. It shall take account of the possibilities offered by the off-season market.

(d) The arrangements referred to in subparagraph (a) shall enter into force at the same time as this Convention and shall remain applicable for its duration.

However, if during the application of this Convention, the Community:

- subjects one or more products to common organization of the market or to specific rules introduced as a result of the implementation of the common agricultural policy, it shall reserve the right to adapt the import treatment for those products originating in the ACP States, following consultations within the Council of Ministers. In such cases, the provisions of subparagraph (a) shall be applicable,

- modifies the common organization of the market in a particular product or the specific rules introduced as a result of the implementation of the common agricultural policy, it shall reserve the right to modify the arrangements laid down for products originating in the ACP States, following consultations within the Council of Ministers. In such cases the Community shall undertake to ensure that products originating in the ACP States continue to enjoy an advantage comparable to that previously enjoyed in relation to products originating in third countries benefiting from the most-favoured-nation clause.

(e) Where the Community intends to conclude a preferential agreement with third States it shall inform the ACP States thereof. Consultations shall take place where the ACP States so request in order to safeguard their interests.

Article 169

1. The Community shall not apply to imports of products originating in the ACP States any quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect.

2. However, paragraph 1 shall apply without prejudice to the import arrangements for the products referred to in the first indent of Article 168 (2) (a).

The Community shall inform the ACP States when residual quantitative restrictions are eliminated in respect of any of these products.

Article 170

1.

Article 169 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security, the protection of health and life of humans, animals and plants, the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value or the protection of industrial and commercial property.

2. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall in no case constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction of trade generally.

In cases where implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 affects the interests of one or more ACP States, consultations shall be held at the request of the latter, in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 12, with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution.

3. Provisions on the movement of hazardous and radioactive waste are set out in Part Two, Title I of this Convention.

Article 171

The treatment applied to imports of products originating in the ACP States may not be more favourable than that applied to trade among the Member States of the Community.

Article 172

Where new measures or measures stipulated in programmes adopted by the Community for the approximation of laws and regulations in order to facilitate the movement of goods are likely to affect the interests of one or more ACP States, the Community shall, prior to adopting such measures, inform the ACP States thereof through the Council of Ministers.

In order to enable the Community to take into consideration the interests of the ACP State concerned, consultations shall be held at the request of the latter in accordance with Article 12, second paragraph, with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution.

Article 173

1. Where existing Community rules or regulations adopted in order to facilitate the movement of goods affect the interests of one or more ACP States or where these interests are affected by the interpretation, application or administration of such rules or regulations, consultations shall be held at the request of the ACP States concerned with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution.

2. With a view to finding a satisfactory solution, the ACP States may also bring up within the Council of Ministers any other problems relating to the movement of goods which might result from measures taken or envisaged by the Member States.

3. The relevant institutions of the Community shall, to the greatest possible extent, inform the Council of Ministers of such measures in order to ensure effective consultations.

Article 174

1. In view of their present development needs, the ACP States shall not be required for the duration of this Convention to assume, in respect of imports of products originating in the Community, obligations corresponding to the commitment entered into by the Community under this Chapter in respect of imports of the products originating in the ACP States.

2. (a) In their trade with the Community, the ACP States shall not discriminate among the Member States and shall grant to the Community treatment no less favourable than most-favoured-nation treatment.

(b) Notwithstanding specific provisions of this Convention, the Community shall not discriminate between ACP States in the field of trade.

(c) The most-favoured-nation treatment referred to in subparagraph (a) shall not apply in respect of trade or economic relations between ACP States or between one or more ACP States and other developing countries.

Article 175

Unless it has already done so under earlier ACP-EEC Conventions, each Contracting Party shall communicate its customs tariff to the Council of Ministers within three months of the entry into force of this Convention. Each Contracting Party shall also communicate any subsequent amendments to its tariff as and when they come into force.

Article 176

1. The concept of 'originating products` for the purposes of implementing this Chapter, and the methods of administrative cooperation relating thereto, are defined in Protocol 1.

2. The Council of Ministers may adopt any amendment to Protocol 1.

3. Where the concept of 'originating products` has not yet been defined for a given product pursuant to paragraphs 1 or 2, each Contracting Party shall continue to apply its own rules.

Article 177

1. Should application of this Chapter result in serious disturbances in a sector of the economy of the Community or of one or more of the Member States, or jeopardize their external financial stability, or if difficulties arise which may result in a deterioration thereof, the Community may take, or may authorize the Member State concerned to take, safeguard measures. These measures, their duration and their methods of application shall be notified immediately to the Council of Ministers.

2. The Community and its Member States undertake not to use other means for protectionist purposes or to hamper structural development. The Community will refrain from using safeguard measures having the same effect.

3. Safeguard measures shall be restricted to those which would least disturb trade between the Contracting Parties in implementing the objectives of this Convention and must not exceed the scope of what is strictly necessary to remedy the difficulties that have arisen.

4. When applied, safeguard measures shall take account of the existing level of the ACP exports concerned to the Community and their potential for development.

Article 178

1. Prior consultations shall take place concerning the application of the safeguard clause, both when such measures are first adopted and when they are extended. The Community shall provide the ACP States with all the information required for such consultations and shall provide the data from which to determine to what extent imports from an ACP State or ACP States of a specific product have caused the effects referred to in Article 177 (1).

2. Where consultations have taken place, safeguard measures, or arrangements jointly agreed upon by the ACP States concerned and the Community, shall enter into force thereafter.

3. However, the prior consultations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not prevent any immediate decisions which the Community or its Member States, in accordance with Article 177 (1), might take where special factors have necessitated such decisions.

4. In order to facilitate the examination of factors that may cause market disturbances, a mechanism shall be instituted for the statistical surveillance of certain ACP exports to the Community.

5. The Contracting Parties undertake to hold regular consultations with a view to finding satisfactory solutions to problems which might result from the application of the safeguard clause.

6. The prior consultations as well as the regular consultations and the surveillance mechanism referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 shall be implemented in accordance with Protocol 4.

Article 179

The Council of Ministers shall, at the request of any Contracting Party concerned, consider the economic and social effects of the application of the safeguard clause.

Article 181

In order to ensure the effective implementation of this Convention in the field of trade and customs cooperation, the Contracting Parties agree to inform and consult each other.

In addition to the cases for which consultations are specifically provided for in Articles 167 to 180, consultations shall also take place, at the request of the Community or of the ACP States, and in accordance with the conditions provided for in the procedural rules in Articles 12, particularly in the following cases:

Consultations shall take place, where the Contracting Parties concerned so request, in order to take account of their respective interests;

(2) if, during the application of this Convention, the ACP States consider that agricultural products covered by Article 168 (2) (a) other than those subject to special treatment should benefit from such treatment, consultations may take place within the Council of Ministers;

(3) where a Contracting Party considers that obstacles to the movement of goods arise as a result of the existing rules of another Contracting Party or the interpretation, application or administration thereof;

(4) where the Community or the Member States take safeguard measures in accordance with Article 177, consultations on these measures may take place within the Council of Ministers, where the Contracting Parties concerned so request, notably with a view to ensuring compliance with Article 177 (3).

5. Following the negotiations referred to in paragraph 4, which will take place within the framework of the Council of Ministers, the Council of Ministers may adopt any amendment to this Chapter.

TITLE II

COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF COMMODITIES

Chapter 1

Stabilization of export earnings from agricultural

commodities

Article 186

1. With the aim of remedying the harmful effects of the instability of export earnings and to help the ACP States overcome one of the main obstacles to the stability, profitability and sustained growth of their economies, to support their development efforts and to enable them in this way to ensure economic and social progress for their peoples by helping to safeguard their purchasing power, a system shall be operated to guarantee the stabilization of export earnings derived from the ACP States' exports to the Community or other destinations as defined in Article 189, of products on which their economies are dependent and which are affected by fluctuations in price or quantity or both these factors.

2. In order to attain these objectives, transfers shall be devoted, in accordance with a framework of mutual obligations to be agreed between the ACP State concerned and the Commission in each case, either to the sector, interpreted in the widest possible sense, that recorded the loss of export earnings and be used there for the benefit of economic operators adversely affected by this loss, or, where appropriate, to diversification, either for use in other appropriate productive sectors in principle agricultural, or for the processing of agricultural products.

Article 187

1. The following products shall be covered: >TABLE>

2. In all cases of application of the system, the Commission shall, in the interests of the ACP State concerned, consider as products within the meaning of this chapter:

(a) each product listed in paragraph 1;

(b) product groups 1 and 2, 3 to 7, 8 and 9, 10 and 11, 12 to 14, 15 to 17, 18 to 21, 22 and 23, 24 and 25, 47 and 48.

Article 188

If, 12 months after the entry into force of this Convention, one or more products not contained in the list in Article 187 but upon which the economies of one or more ACP States depend to a considerable extent are affected by sharp fluctuations, the Council of Ministers shall decide, not more than six months after the presentation of a request by the ACP State or States concerned whether or not to include the said product or products in the list, taking account of factors such as employment, deterioration of the terms of trade between the Community and the ACP State concerned, the level of development of the ACP State concerned and the conditions which characterize products originating in the Community.

Article 189

1. The system shall apply to earnings from exports:

(a) by each ACP State to the Community of each product referred to in Article 187 (2);

(b) by the ACP States benefiting from the derogation referred to in paragraph 2 to the other ACP States of each product referred to in Article 187 (2) for which such derogation has been granted;

(c) by the ACP States benefiting from the derogation referred to in paragraph 3 to all destinations of each product referred to in Article 187 (2).

2. At the request of one or more ACP States in respect of one or more of the products referred to in Article 187 (1), the Council of Ministers may decide, after examination of a report established by the Commission on the basis of the relevant information provided by the requesting ACP State or States, and not more than six months after the presentation of the request, to apply the system to exports of the products in question from the said ACP State or States to other ACP States.

3. If, on the basis of relevant data for the average of the two years preceding the application year, at least 70 % of an ACP State's total export earnings from products covered by the system do not come from exports to the Community, the system shall be automatically applied to its exports of each of the products referred to in Article 187 (2), whatever the destination.

In the case of the least-developed ACP States this percentage shall be 60 %.

For each year of application and for each ACP State, the Commission shall check that these criteria have been fulfilled.

Article 190

For the purposes stipulated in Article 186 and for the duration of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention, the amount provided for in that protocol shall be allocated to the system. This amount shall cover all commitments under the system. It shall be managed by the Commission.

Article 191

1. The overall amount referred to in Article 190 shall be divided into a number of equal annual instalments corresponding to the number of years of application of the Financial Protocol.

2. Whatever balance remains at the end of each year of application of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention except the last shall be carried forward automatically to the following year.

Article 192

Interest earned by investment in the market, over the period from 1 April to 30 June, of the sum equivalent to half each annual instalment, minus any advances and transfers paid during that period, shall be credited to the system's resources.

Interest earned by investment in the market, over the period from 1 July to 31 March, of the sum equivalent to the second half of each annual instalment, minus any advances and transfers paid during that second period, shall be credited to the system's resources.

Any part of an annual instalment which has not been advanced or transferred shall continue to bear interest which will be added to the system's resources until its utilization in the following year.

Article 193

The resources available for each year of application are made up of the sum of the following:

(1) the annual instalment, plus any amounts available or less any amounts used under Article 194 (1);

(2) the sums carried forward under Article 191 (2);

(3) the amount of interest earned pursuant to Article 192.

Article 194

1. If the total amount of the transfer bases in a year of application, calculated in accordance with Article 197, and where appropriate reduced in accordance with Articles 202 to 204, exceeds the amount of resources available in the system for that year, advance use shall be made automatically, for each year except the last, of a maximum of 25 % of the following year's instalment.

2. If, after the operation referred to in paragraph 1, the amount of resources available is still less than the total amount of the transfer bases referred to in paragraph 1 for the same year of application, the amount of each transfer basis shall be reduced by 10 % of that amount.

3. If, after the reduction referred to in paragraph 2, the total amount of the transfers so calculated is less than the amount of resources available, the remainder shall be shared among all the transfers in proportion to the amounts by which each transfer was reduced.

4. If, after the reduction referred to in paragraph 2, the total amount of the transfers which may give rise to a payment exceeds the amount of available resources, the Council of Ministers shall evaluate the situation on the basis of a Commission report on the probable development of the system and shall examine the steps to be taken to remedy that situation, within the terms of this Convention.

Article 195

In the case of any balance remaining from the overall amount referred to in Article 190, including the interest referred to in Article 192 after the expiry of the last year of administration of the system under the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention:

(a) the amounts resulting from the application of the percentages referred to in Article 197 (3) and (4) shall be repaid to each ACP State in proportion to the deduction or deductions made in application of those provisions;

(b) if any balance remains after application of (a), the Council of Ministers shall decide on its use.

Article 196

1. The system shall apply to the earnings from an ACP State's exports of the products referred to in Article 187 (2) if, during the year preceding the year of application, earnings from the export of each product to all destinations, re-exports excluded, represented at least 5 % of its total earnings from exports of all goods. The percentage shall be 4 % in the case of sisal.

2. For the least-developed, landlocked and island ACP States, the percentage referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 1 %.

3. Where, following a natural disaster, a substantial fall in production of the product in question is recorded during the year preceding the year of application, the percentage referred to in paragraph 1 shall be calculated on the basis of the average export earnings from that product during the three years preceding the year of the disaster.

A substantial fall in production shall be taken to mean at least 50 % of the average production during the three years preceding the year of the disaster.

Article 197

1. In order to implement the system, a reference level and a transfer basis shall be calculated for each ACP State and for exports of each product referred to in Article 187 (1) to the Community or other destinations as defined in Article 189.

2. The reference level shall be constituted by the average of export earnings during the period of the six calendar years preceding each year of application less the two years with the highest and lowest figures.

3. The transfer basis shall be constituted by the difference between the reference level and actual earnings in the calendar year of application, reduced by an amount corresponding to 4,5 % of the reference level. In the case of the least-developed ACP States, this percentage shall be 1 %.

4. The reductions referred to in paragraph 3 shall not apply in the case of the least-developed or landlocked ACP States if the difference between the reference level and actual earnings is less than ECU 2 million, or in the case of island ACP States if this difference is less than ECU 1 million.

In no case shall the reduction of the difference between the reference level and actual earnings be greater than:

- 20 % for the least-developed and for landlocked ACP States,

-30 % for other ACP States.

5. The amount of the transfer shall be the transfer basis after application, where relevant, of Articles 202 to 204 and 194.

Article 198

1. Where an ACP State:

- begins processing a product traditionally exported in the raw state, or

-begins exporting a product which it did not traditionally produce,

the system may be put into operation on the basis of a reference level calculated over the three years preceding the year of application.

2. In the case of the ACP States accorded the derogation:

- referred to in Article 189 (2), the transfer basis shall be calculated by adding to the earnings from exports of the product or products concerned to the Community the earnings from exports of those products to other ACP States;

-referred to in Article 189 (3), the transfer basis shall be calculated according to the earnings from exports of the product or products concerned to all destinations.

Article 199

1. In order to ensure that the system functions efficiently and rapidly, statistical cooperation shall be instituted between each ACP State and the Commission.

2. The ACP States shall notify the Commission of the annual statistical data specified in the joint declaration in Annex XLIII.

3. This information must be sent to the Commission not later than 31 March in the year following that of application. Failure to do so shall result in the ACP State concerned losing all transfer rights in relation to the product or products in question for the relevant year of application.

Article 200

1. The system shall be implemented in respect of the products listed in Article 187 where they are:

(a) released for home use in the Community, or

(b) brought into the Community under the inward processing arrangements in order to be processed.

2. The statistics to be used to carry out the calculations referred to in Article 197 shall be those calculated and published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities.

3. In the case of ACP States accorded the derogation

(a) referred to in Article 189 (2), the statistics relating to exports of the product or products in question to other ACP States shall be the volume exported by the ACP State concerned multiplied by the average unit value of imports by the Community as calculated and published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities or, failing those, the statistics of the ACP State concerned;

(b) referred to in Article 189 (3), the statistics relating to exports of the product or products in question to all destinations shall be the volume exported by the ACP State concerned multiplied by the average unit value of imports by the Community as calculated and published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities or, failing those, the statistics of the ACP State concerned.

4. Should there be significant differences between the statistics of the Statistical Office of the European Communities and those of the ACP State concerned, consultation shall be held between that ACP State and the Commission.

Article 201

Article 202

The transfer basis shall be reduced in due proportion to the fall in earnings from exports to the Community of the product in question if, after joint examination by the Commission and the ACP State concerned, it appears that such a drop is the consequence of trade-policy measures taken by the ACP State or through its economic operators with the aim of restricting supply; such reduction may entail the annulment of the transfer basis.

Article 203

Should examination of the trend of the ACP State's exports, to all destinations, of production of the product in question in the ACP State concerned and of demand in the Community reveal significant changes, consultations shall take place between the Commission and that ACP State to determine whether the transfer basis is to be maintained or reduced, and, if so, to what extent.

Mining products: Special financing facility (Sysmin)

Article 214

1. A special financing facility shall be set up for those ACP States whose mining sectors occupy an important place in their economies and are facing difficulties that are already perceived or foreseeable in the near future.

2. Its aims are to contribute towards establishing a more solid and wider basis for the development of the ACP States while supporting their efforts:

- to safeguard their mining production and export sectors by remedial or preventive action designed to alleviate the serious consequences for their economies of the loss of viability as a result of a decline in their production or export capacity and/or export earnings in the mining products sector following major technological or economic changes or temporary or unforeseeable disruptions beyond the control of the State concerned and of the enterprise managing the sector concerned. Particular attention shall be paid to adjusting the competitive situation of enterprises to changes in market conditions, or

-for States heavily dependent on exports of one mining product, to diversify and broaden the bases of their economic growth, notably by helping them complete development projects and programmes under way where these are seriously jeopardized owing to substantial falls in export earnings from that product.

3. In pursuing these objectives, this support:

- will be adapted to the economic restructuring needs of the ACP State concerned,

-will take into account at the time of its formulation and implementation the mutual interests of the Contracting Parties.

Article 215

1. The special financing facility provided for in Article 214 shall be aimed at ACP States which export to the Community and which, during at least two of the four years preceding that of the request for aid, have derived either:

(a) 15 % or more of their export earnings from one of the following products: copper (including cobalt), phosphates, manganese, bauxite and alumina, tin, iron ore, whether or not in agglomerate form, uranium; or

(b)20 % or more of their export earnings from all mining products (excluding precious minerals other than gold, oil and gas).

However, for least-developed, landlocked or island ACP States, the figure stipulated in (a) shall be 10 % and the figure stipulated in (b) shall be 12 %.

For the calculation of the thresholds referred to in (a) and (b) earnings shall not include those from mining products not covered by the system.

2. Recourse to the special financing facility shall be possible where, in the light of the aims referred to above:

(a) it is perceived or expected that the viability of one or more enterprises in the mining sector has been or is about to be seriously affected following temporary or unforeseeable difficulties - wehter technical, economic or political - beyond the control of the State or undertaking concerned, and where such damage to viability leads to or may lead to a significant fall in revenue for the ACP State concerned - assessed in particular on the basis of a drop in production or export capacities of the product in question of around 10 % - and/or a deterioration in its external trade balance.

Foreseeable damage to viability shall be characterized by the onset of deterioration of the means of production and its impact on the country's economy; or

(b) in cases under paragraph 1 (1), it is perceived that a substantial fall in export earnings from the mining product concerned, in relation to the average for the two years before the request, is seriously jeopardizing the completion of development projects and programmes under way. To be taken into consideration, such a fall in earnings must:

- be caused by technical, economic or political difficulties and not artificially provoked, directly or indirectly, by policies and measures of the ACP State or the economic operators concerned,

-result in a corresponding fall in total export earnings of approximately 10 % at least in the year before that of the request.

The said difficulties shall refer to disruptions such as accidents, serious technical incidents, serious internal or external political events, major technological and economic changes or major changes in trade relations with the Communtiy.

3. An ACP State may request financial aid under the special financing facility where the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 are met.

Article 216

1. The aid referred to in Article 215 shall be used in pursuit of the aims of the facility as set out in Article 214 (2).

- Where maintenance or return to viability of the mining enterprise or enterprises affected is deemed possible and appropriate by the two parties, the aid shall be used to finance projects or programmes, including the financial restructuring of the enterprise or enterprises concerned, with a view to maintaining, re-establishing or rationalizing at a viable level the production and export capacity concerned.

-Where it is not thought possible by the two parties to maintain or restore viability, the aid shall be used to broaden the bases of economic growth through the financing of viable horizontal or vertical conversion or diversification projects or programmes.

-By common agreement, the aim of diversification may also be pursued where the economy is dependent on the mining product in question to a significant degree, even where viability can be re-established.

-Where Article 215 (2) (b) is applicable, the objective of diversification shall be pursued through financial assistance to aid the completion of development projects and programmes under way outside the mining sector which are in jeopardy.

2. Any decision to allocate funds to projects or programmes shall take due account of economic interests and the social implications of such aid in the ACP State concerned and in the Community and will be adapted to the economic restructuring needs of that ACP State.

In the case of requests presented under Article 215 (1) (b), the Community and the ACP State concerned shall jointly and systematically seek to establish the scope and the terms of any aid accorded in such a way that such aid does not injure competing Community mining production.

The consideration and appraisal of these factors shall be part of the analysis referred to in Article 217 (2).

3. Special attention shall be accorded to:

- processing and transport operations, notably at regional level, and the proper integration of the mining sector in the country's overall economic and social development,

-preventive operations to minimize any disruptive effects by adapting technology, improving the technical and managerial skills of local staff and adapting the skills of local staff to enterprise management techniques,

-stepping up the ACP States' scientific and technical capacity for the production of new materials.

Article 217

1. The request for aid must include information on the nature of the problems encountered, the perceived or expected consequences of the disruption both at national level and at the level of the mining enterprise or enterprises affected and indications in the form of an identification sheet on the measures or actions undertaken or desired to remedy them.

The request shall be made as soon as these consequences are identified and within a period not exceeding 12 months for making up the file.

2. Prior to any Community decision a technical, economic and financial analysis shall be made systematically of the mining sector concerned in order to assess both the eligibility of the request and the project or programme to be undertaken to utilize the aid. That analysis, which shall be very detailed, shall, in order to identify the operation, take particular account of world market prospects and, without prejudice to the first paragraph of Article 216 (2), the situation of the Community market in the products concerned. It shall also include an analysis of the possible implications of such an operation for the competing mining products of Member States and the possible implications of its non-implementation for the ACP State concerned. Its objective shall be to ascertain:

- whether the viability of the means of production concerned has been or is likely to be damaged and whether that viability can be restored, or whether recourse to diversification measures is more appropriate, or

-whether the fall in export earnings referred to in Article 215 (2) (b) seriously joepardizes the implementation of development projects and programmes under way.

The analysis shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures for financial and technical cooperation. It shall require the close cooperation of the ACP State and economic operators concerned.

3. A single decision shall be taken on eligibility and the financing proposal.

The Community and the ACP State concerned shall take the necessary steps to expedite appraisal of requests so that the appropriate action may be taken swiftly.

Article 218

1. If necessary, technical assistance for setting up and supervising the project may be financed under the facility.

2. The procedures applicable to such assistance and the detailed rules for its implementation shall be those laid down in this Convention for development finance cooperation.

Article 219

1. For the purposes specified in Article 214 and for the period of application of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention, the Community shall allocate the overall amount provided for in that Protocol to cover all its commitments under this special financing facility. The amount allocated to the facility shall be managed by the Commission.

2. (a) This overall amount shall be divided into a number of equal annual instalments corresponding to the number of years of application. Each year, except the last, the Council of Ministers, on the basis of a report submitted to it by the Commission, may authorize the advance use of up to 50 % of the following year's instalment where required.

(b)Any balances remaining at the end of each year of application of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention, except the last, shall be carried over automatically to the following year.

(c)Consequently, the resources available for each year of application will be made up of the following elements:

- the annual instalment, less any amounts used under (a);

-the sums carried over under (b);

(d) If the resources available for any year of application are insufficient, the amounts provided for shall be reduced accordingly, without prejudice to subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c).

Before expiry of the period of application of the Financial Protocol, the Council of Ministers shall decide on the allocation of any balances remaining from the overall amount.

3. The amount of the aid provided for in Article 215 shall be determined by the Commission in the light of the funds available under the special financing facility, the nature of the relevant projects and programmes, the possibilities for cofinancing and the relative importance of the mining industry concerned for the economy of the ACP State.

4. Under no circumstances may a single ACP State be eligible for more than 35 % of the resources available as a result of the application of paragraph 2 (c). The rate shall be 15 % for aid under Article 215 (1) (b).

5. Aid accorded to an ACP State under the special financing facility may be on-lent by that State to the final borrower on different financial terms which shall be established in the financing decision and shall result from an analysis of the aid project conducted on the basis of the usual economic and financial criteria for the type of project planned.

6. The analysis referred to in Article 217 shall be financed from resources of the facility.

7. In exceptional circumstances arising out of an emergency, confirmation and proof of which will have to be provided initially by the analysis, an ACP State which so requests my be granted an advance by way of partial prefinancing of the project or programme which it precedes.

(b) In the case of equity participation, it may be provided to acquire temporary minority holdings on behalf of the Community in the capital of ACP enterprises or institutions financing development projects in the ACP States or of ACP financial institutions promoting and financing private investment in the ACP States. Such holdings shall be transferred to nationals or institutions of the ACP States or as otherwise agreed with the ACP State concerned, once the conditions specified for the purpose are met.

(c) The terms of risk capital operations shall depend on the characteristics of each project or programme financed and shall in general be more favourable than those of subsidized loans. In the case of loans the interest rate shall, in any case, be less than 3 %.

2. In order to minimize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, the problem of exchange rate risk shall be dealt with in the following way:

(a) in the case of risk capital operations designed to strengthen an enterprise's own funds the exchange rate risk shall as a general rule be borne by the Community;

(b) in the case of risk capital financing for investments of private sector firms and small and medium-sized enterprises, hereinafter referred to as 'SMEs`, the exchange rate risk shall be shared by the Community, on the one part, and by the other parties involved, on the other. On average, the foreign exchange risk shall be shared equally.

Article 235

Loans from the Bank's own resources shall be granted under the following terms and conditions:

(a) the rate of interest before subsidy shall be the rate applied by the Bank for the currencies, duration and repayment conditions adopted for the loan on the day of signature of the contract;

(b) this rate shall be reduced by means of a 4 % subsidy. The rate of subsidy shall be automatically adjusted so that the interest rate borne by the borrower will be neither less than 3 % nor more than 6 % for a loan contracted at the reference rate. The reference rate adopted for calculating the adjustment in the rate of subsidy shall be the rate for the ecu applied by the Bank for a loan with the same conditions as to duration and repayment on the day of signature of the contract;

(c) the amount of the interest rate subsidy calculated in terms of its value at the times of disbursement of the loan shall be charged against the amount of grants and paid directly to the Bank;

(d) the duration of loans made by the Bank from its own resources shall be governed by terms stipulated on the basis of the economic and financial characteristics of the project, but may not exceed 25 years. These loans shall normally comprise a grace period fixed by reference to the construction period and the funds needed for the project.

Article 236

The Bank shall:

(a) contribute, through the resources it manages, to the economic and industrial development of the ACP States on a national and regional scale; and to this end, finance in the first place, productive projects and programmes in industry, agro-industry, tourism, mining, energy and in transport and telecommunications linked to these sectors. These sectoral priorities shall not exclude the possibility of the Bank's financing, from its own resources, productive projects and programmes in other sectors including commercial agriculture;

(b) establish close cooperation links with national and regional development banks and with banking and financial institutions of the ACP States;

(c) in consultation with the ACP State concerned, adapt the arrangements and procedures for implementing development finance cooperation, as set out in this Convention, if necessary, to take account of the nature of the projects and programmes and to act in accordance with the objectives of this Convention, within the framework of the procedures laid down by its statute.

Article 237

The ACP States concerned shall, in respect of loans granted or equity participation under the Convention, and in respect of which they have given their written approval:

(a) grant exemption from all national or local duties, fiscal charges on interest, commissions and amortization of loans due in accordance with the law or laws of the ACP State or States concerned;

(b) place at the disposal of the beneficiaries the currency necessary for the payment of interest, commission and the amortization of loans due in terms of financing contracts granted for the implementation of projects and programmes on their territories;

(c) make available to the Bank the foreign currency necessary for the transfer of all sums received by it in national currency at the exchange rate applicable between the ecu, or other currencies of transfer, and the national currency at the date of the transfer, which represent the net revenue and proceeds from transactions involving the acquisition by the Community of holdings in the capital of companies or firms.

Article 238

Special treatment shall be accorded to the least-developed ACP States when determining the volume of the financial resources which such States may expect from the Community for the purpose of their indicative programmes. In addition, account shall be taken of the particular difficulties of the landlocked or island ACP States. These financial resources shall be combined with more favourable terms of financing, having regard to the economic situation and the nature of the needs specific to each State. They shall consist essentially of grants, and, in appropriate cases, of risk capital or loans from the Bank, having regard in particular to the criteria laid down in Article 233 (2).

Section 3

Debt and structural adjustment support

Debt

Article 239

1. The ACP States and the Community share the view that the external debt situation of ACP States has emerged as a major development issue, and that the associated heavy debt-servicing obligations contribute to constraints on import capacity and the level of investments in these States, thus affecting their growth and development.

2. The ACP States and the Community reaffirm their determination to develop and implement in a coordinated and integrated way the different instruments of the Convention and to implement the following measures with a view to contributing to the attenuation of the debt burden of the ACP States and their balance of payment problems with a view to stimulating economic recovery and growth.

Article 240

1. In order to avoid increases in the debt of ACP States, finance under this Convention, apart from bank loans and risk capital, is provided in the form of grants. Specifically the following measures and actions will be taken:

(a) for projects with high rates of return, and in particular for Sysmin financing, a two-stage procedure will be followed whereby ACP States will receive grants and will on-lend the funds at appropriate market terms and conditions, with suitable arrangements for deposit of interest and repayment, less an agreed service charge, in a counterpart fund account, managed according to normal procedures as agreed for this type of finance generated from Community assistance;

(b) Stabex transfers will be granted without any obligation for the beneficiary ACP States to reconstitute the resources of the system.

2. In addition, the Community agrees to:

(a) enable, on a case-by-case basis, the acceleration of the use of the resources of past indicative programmes which have not been committed through the quick-disbursing instruments provided for in this Convention in order to contribute to the attenuation of the debt burden;

(b) grant, at the request of an ACP State:

(i) assistance in studying and finding practical solutions to indebtedness, debt-servicing difficulties and balance of payments problems;

(ii) training in external debt management and international financial negotiations as well as support for training workshops, courses and seminars in these fields;

(iii) assistance to ACP States in developing flexible techniques and instruments of debt management to deal with unanticipated interest rate and exchange rate variations;

(c) encourage its institutions, including the Bank, to play a more active role in catalysing new flows of finance to debt-affected ACP States.

Article 241

The Community commits itself to support the ACP States' efforts to:

(a) undertake reforms with a view to improving the performance of the economy;

(b) strengthen their external debt management mechanisms at national level so as to exercise more effective control over external borrowing by the public sector, and monitor private sector borrowing;

(c) reverse the outflow of capital;

(d) intensify their efforts to reduce inflation and implement measures designed to increase domestic savings;

(e) introduce concrete measures to improve the quality of investment in both the public and private sectors;

(f) give adequate incentives to projects that generate or save foreign exchange;

(g) as a long-term objective, develop subregional capital markets which can serve as effective mechanisms for tapping ACP surplus funds invested abroad;

(h) adopt measures aimed at increasing intra-ACP trade through the use of existing subregional and regional payments mechanisms and encourage clearing arrangements and credit insurance in all intra-ACP trade transactions.

Article 242

In order to contribute to the servicing of the debt resulting from Community loans from the Bank's own resources, special loans and risk capital, the ACP States may, in accordance with arrangements to be made on a case-by-case basis with the Commission, use the available foreign currency referred to in Article 319 for such servicing, as and when debt repayment falls due and up to the amount required for payments in national currency.

Structural adjustment support

Article 243

The ACP States and the Community recognize that the economic and social problems being experienced by ACP States are the result of both internal factors and external developments. They see the need for urgent action and share the view that short and medium-term policies must reinforce the long-term development efforts and goals of ACP States. To this end, they have agreed that the Convention should provide structural adjustment support to assist ACP States in their effort to:

(a) create an economic environment favourable to a resumption of, or to an acceleration in, the growth of GDP and employment;

(b) improve the social and economic well-being of the population as a whole;

(c) improve public sector management and provide appropriate private sector incentives;

(d) increase the level of productivity in the key sectors of the economy;

(e) achieve greater economic diversification as part of the effort to develop a larger measure of resilience in the economy and to reduce domestic and external imbalances while maintaining GDP growth;

(f) improve balance-of-payments performance and the foreign-exchange position;

(g) ensure that adjustment is economically viable and socially and politically bearable.

Article 244

Adjustment support shall be administered on the basis of the following principles:

(a) the ACP States shall bear primary responsibility for the analysis of the problems to be solved and the preparation of reform programmes;

(b) support programmes shall be adapted to the different situation in each ACP State and be sensitive to the social conditions, culture and environment of these States;

(c) assistance shall be supportive of the ACP State's priority development objectives such as agricultural and rural development, food security, PMDT and environmental protection, and contribute to the attenuation of the debt burden;

(d) adjustment support shall take place within the framework of the political and economic model of the ACP State concerned;

(e) the right of the ACP States to determine the direction of their development strategies and priorities shall be recognized and respected;

(f) both the reform and the support programme shall make provision from the outset to deal with the negative social effects that may result from the process of adjustment efforts, in pursuit of the objectives of economic growth and social justice, particular attention being paid to the most vulnerable groups in the society including the poor, the unemployed, women and children;

(g) the pace of the reform programmes shall be realistic and compatible with each ACP State's capacities and resources, while the implementation of support programmes shall be flexible and adapted to the management capacity of the ACP State concerned;

(h) quick disbursement shall be an important feature of support programmes;

(i) support shall be given in the context of a joint assessment between the Community and the ACP State concerned on the reform measures being undertaken or contemplated either at a macroeconomic or sectoral level.

Article 245

1. For purposes of structural adjustment support, Community financial assistance shall be given in form of grants:

(a) as provided for in Article 1 of the Financial Protocol; and

(b) from the indicative programme, in accordance with Article 281 (2) (e).

2. On the expiry of the Financial Protocol, appropriations set aside for structural adjustment support and not committed shall be paid back, save as otherwise decided by the Council of Ministers, to the assets of the Fund for the purpose of financing other operations falling within the scope of development finance cooperation, notably those relating to programmable assistance.

Article 246

1. All ACP States shall in principle be eligible for structural adjustment assistance depending on the scope of the reforms being undertaken or contemplated at the macroeconomic or sectoral level, their effectiveness, and their likely impact on the economic, social and political dimension of development, and on economic and social hardships being experienced, as reflected, by indicators such as:

(a) the level of indebtedness and the debt service burden;

(b) balance of payments difficulties;

(c) the budgetary situation;

(d) the monetary situation;

(e) the rate of growth of real national income;

(f) the level of unemployment;

(g) the situation in social areas such as nutrition, housing, health and education.

2. ACP States undertaking reform programmes that are acknowledged and supported at least by the principal multilateral donors, or that are agreed with such donors but not necessarily financially supported by them, shall be treated as having automatically satisfied the requirements for adjustment assistance.

3. In assessing the social and economic hardships referred to in paragraph 1, particular attention will be given to the least-developed ACP States.

Article 247

1. The resources earmarked for structural adjustment support may be mobilized either at the beginning of or during the Financial Protocol period, at the request of the ACP State concerned.

2. Such support for adjustment effort shall take the form of:

(a) sectoral or general import programmes in accordance with Articles 224 (c) and 225;

(b) technical assistance related to structural adjustment support programmes.

3. In addition, with a view to alleviating the ACP States' domestic financial constraints, counterpart funds generated by various Community instruments may be used in accordance with Article 226.

4. Structural adjustment support shall be implemented flexibly and the instruments chosen on a case-by-case basis.

A GIP designed in keeping with the approach to structural adjustment support laid down in the Convention will usually be the most appropriate instrument for countries carrying out macroeconomic reforms. In the case of sectoral adjustment, the assistance will be given in the form of an SIP in kind or in foreign currency.

An SIP could also be used in a situation of macroeconomic reforms with a view to achieving a greater sectoral impact.

Article 248

The implementation of each support programme shall:

(a) be adapted to the needs of each recipient State;

(b) ensure consistency between the use of the different support instruments and the approach of structural adjustment as defined in Articles 243 and 244;

(c) ensure that the eligibility of ACP economic operators for access to the resources of the programme is as wide and transparent as possible and that the best price/quality ratio is obtained on imported goods. To this end this Convention's tendering procedures must be applied flexibly in order to:

- ensure the rapidity of disbursements,

-minimize the administrative burden on the State concerned,

-accord with the administrative and commercial practices of that State;

(d) be the subject of an agreement between the Commission and the ACP body in charge of the implementation of the programme.

Article 249

In order to increase the flow of financial resources the Community, with the agreement of the ACP State concerned, may enter into cofinancing arrangements with other donors or agencies. The various provisions of this Convention on cofinancing shall apply. To this end and in order to ensure effective use of resources and to minimize delays, efforts shall be made, subject to the agreement of the ACP State concerned and with its effective participation, to:

(a) coordinate the approach of the various donors towards structural adjustment support;

(b) coordinate operational implementation in a simple and cost-effective manner.

Article 250

1. The ACP State's request for structural adjustment support shall contain the broad outline of the underlying problems being addressed by the ACP State and of the measures and actions being implemented or contemplated, the areas in which support is required, the social repercussions being experienced or envisaged and proposals to deal with them, as well as the cost estimates of the support programme for which assistance is being sought and the duration or likely period of completion.

2. The preparation, appraisal and financing decision for structural adjustment programmes shall be carried out according to the provisions on implementation procedures of Chapter 5 with due regard to the need to ensure the quick disbursing feature of structural adjustment programmes. On a case-by-case basis, retroactive financing of a limited part of imports of ACP-EEC origin may be permissible.

3. In the case of foreign exchange programmes, funds will be transferred to an ecu-denominated bank account opened by the ACP States concerned in a Community Member State from which all disbursement covered by the programme shall be made. Such funds will be considered as an advance to be cleared by the submission of justification of the use of funds.

Section 4

Cofinancing

Article 251

1. The financial resources provided for in this Convention may be applied, at the request of the ACP States, to cofinancing (undertaken in particular with development agencies and institutions, Community Member States, ACP States, third countries or international or private financial institutions, firms, or export credit agencies).

2. Special consideration shall be given to the possibility of cofinancing in the following cases, among others:

(a) large-scale projects which cannot be financed exclusively by any one source of financing alone;

(b) projects in which Community participation, and an input of its project expertise, might facilitate the participation of other additional sources of finance;

(c) projects which may benefit from a blend of concessionary and non-concessionary financing;

(d) projects which may be broken down into sub-projects which could be eligible for financing from different sources;

(e) projects for which a diversification of financing may lead to an advantageous solution from the point of view of the financing and investment costs and of other aspects of the implementation of the said projects;

(f) projects of a regional or inter-regional nature.

3. Cofinancing may be in the form of joint or parallel financing. Preference will be given in each case to the solution which is more suitable from the point of view of cost-effectiveness.

4. With the agreement of the parties concerned:

(a) measures shall be taken to coordinate and harmonize operations of the Community and those of other cofinancing bodies, in order to minimize the number of procedures to be undertaken by the ACP States and to render those procedures more flexible, notably as regards:

(i) the needs of other cofinancing bodies and recipients;

(ii) the choice of projects to be cofinanced and the arrangements for carrying them out;

(iii) the harmonization of works, supply and services contracts rules and procedures;

(iv) the payment terms;

(v) the rules of eligibility and competition;

(vi) the margin of preference granted to ACP enterprises;

(b) the process of consultation and coordination with other donors and cofinanciers should be strengthened and developed, where possible, through the establishment of cofinancing framework agreements, and cofinancing policies and procedures should be reviewed to ensure effectiveness and the best terms possible;

(c) the Community may provide the other cofinancing bodies with administrative help or may act as a lead or coordinating agency for projects part-financed by it in order to facilitate the implementation of cofinanced projects or programmes.

Section 5

(c) exceptionally, by the ACP State concerned, either in the form of a financial contribution or through the use of public equipment or the supply of services.

3. The amounts representing the Fund's contribution shall be drawn from the grant allocation of the national indicative programme.

4. Special priority shall be accorded to the preparation and implementation of micro-projects in the least-developed ACP States.

Article 253

With the agreement of the ACP States concerned, at the request of the ACP local communities concerned and in accordance with the provisions on multiannual micro-project programmes in Article 290, ACP and Community non-profit organizations may, in addition to the possibilities of cofinancing, coordinate, supervise or implement individual micro-projects and/or multiannual micro-project programmes.

Section 6

Emergency assistance

Article 254

1. Emergency assistance shall be accorded to ACP States faced with serious economic and social difficulties of an exceptional nature resulting from natural disasters or extraordinary circumstances having comparable effects. The assistance, which is intended to make, by the most suitable means, a real contribution to remedying the immediate difficulties:

(a) shall be sufficiently flexible to take any form adapted to the circumstances, including the supply of a wide range of relief goods and services and/or the distribution of cash to victims;

(d) funds may be used for the retroactive financing of immediate relief measures undertaken by the ACP States themselves.

Article 255

1. Assistance may be granted to ACP States taking in refugees or returnees to meet acute needs not covered by emergency assistance, to implement in the longer term projects and action programmes aimed at self-sufficiency and the integration or reintegration of such people.

2. Similar assistance, as set out in paragraph 1, may be envisaged to help with the voluntary integration or reintegration of persons who have had to leave their homes as a result of conflicts or natural disasters. In implementing this provision account shall be taken of all the factors leading to the displacement in question including the wishes of the population concerned and the responsibilities of the government in meeting the needs of its own people.

3. Underlining the developmental nature of the assistance granted in accordance with this Article, assistance may be used together with the indicative programme of the State concerned.

4. Such assistance shall be administered and implemented under procedures permitting flexibility and rapid action. Special attention shall be paid to the most effective manner of providing such assistance to the population concerned. Conditions for payment and implementation shall be laid down case by case. The assistance may be implemented, if the ACP State so agrees, in conjunction with specialized organizations, including those of the United Nations, or by the Commission direct.

The post-emergency needs may be covered by other resources, in particular the counterpart funds generated by Community instruments, the special appropriation for refugees, returnees, and displaced persons, the national or regional indicative programmes or a combination of these different elements.

These needs may also be covered, subject to the provisions of Article 2 of the Financial Protocol, by the unexpended balance of the special appropriation for emergency assistance remaining upon expiry of that Protocol.

The Commission and the Bank shall, with the assistance of Member States and ACP States, ensure effective coordination at the operational level among all parties interested in supporting investment in ACP States.

With a view to keeping those parties informed on investment prospects, the Commission shall produce reports and studies notably on:

- investment flows between the Community and the ACP States, economic, legal or institutional obstacles hampering those investments, measures which will facilitate private capital movements, joint financing, access of ACP States to international financial markets and the effectiveness of domestic financial markets,

-activities undertaken by national and international systems of investment guarantees,

-investment promotion and protection agreements between Member States and ACP States.

The Commission shall submit to the ACP-EEC Development Finance Cooperation Committee the results of these studies. It shall also, in collaboration with the Bank, submit a report on the results of coordination in the field of investment and private sector support.

Section 5

Current payments and capital movements

Article 273

1. With regard to capital movements linked with investments and to current payments, the Contracting Parties shall refrain from taking action in the field of foreign exchange transactions which would be incompatible with their obligations under this Convention resulting from the provisions relating to trade in goods and services, establishment and industrial cooperation. These obligations shall not, however, prevent the Contracting Parties from adopting the necessary protective measures should they be justified by reasons relating to serious economic difficulties or severe balance-of-payments problems.

2. In respect of foreign exchange transactions linked with investments and current payments, the ACP States, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other, shall avoid, as far as possible, taking discriminatory measures vis-a-vis each other or according more favourable treatment to third States, taking full account of the evolving nature of the international monetary system, the existence of specific monetary arrangements and balance-of-payments problems.

To the extent that such measures or treatment are unavoidable, they shall be maintained or introduced in accordance with accepted international monetary rules and every effort shall be made to minimize any adverse effects on the parties affected.

Section 6

As regards arrangements that may be applied in matters of establishment and provision of services, the ACP States, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other, shall treat nationals and companies or firms of the ACP States and nationals and companies or firms of the Member States respectively on a non-discriminatory basis. However, if, for a given activity, an ACP State or a Member State is unable to provide such treatment, the ACP State or the Member State, as the case may be, shall not be bound to accord such treatment for that activity to the nationals and companies or firms of the State concerned.

2. For the purpose of this Convention, 'companies or firms of a Member State or of an ACP State` mean companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including corporations, whether public or otherwise, cooperative societies and other legal persons and partnerships governed by public or private law, save for those which are non-profitmaking, formed in accordance with the law of a Member State or an ACP State and whose statutory office, central administration or principal place of business is in a Member State or ACP State.

However, a company or firm having only its statutory office in a Member State or an ACP State must be engaged in an activity which has an effective and continuous link with the economy of that Member State or the ACP State.

PROTOCOL No 1

concerning the definition of the concept of 'originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation

TITLE I

DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF 'ORIGINATING PRODUCTS'

Article 1

Origin criteria

For the purpose of implementing the trade cooperation provisions of the Convention, a product shall be considered to be originating in the ACP States if it has been either wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in the ACP States.

Article 2

Wholly obtained products

1. The following shall be sondidered as wholly obtained either in the ACP States, or in the Community, or in the countries and territories defined in Annex III, hereinafter referred to as the 'OCT':

(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;

(b) vegetable products harvested therein;

(c) live animals born and raised therein;

(d) products from live animals raised therein;

(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted therein;

(f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by their vessels;

(g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);

(h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials;

(i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted therein;

(j) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (i).

2. The term 'their vessels' in paragraph 1 (f) shall apply only to vessels:

- which are registered or recorded in a Member State, in an ACP State, or in an OCT,

-which sail under the flag of a Member State, of an ACP State, or of an OCT,

-which are owned to an extent of at least 50 % by nationals of States party to the Convention, or of an OCT, or by a company with its head office in one of these States or OCT, of which the manager or managers, chairman of the board of directors or the supervisory board, and the majority of the members of such boards, are nationals of States party to the Convention or of an OCT and of which, in addition in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to States party to the Convention or to public bodies or nationals of such States, or of an OCT,

-of which at least 50 % of the crew, master and officers included, are nationals of States party to the Convention, or of an OCT.

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, where an ACP State offers the Community the opportunity to negotiate a fisheries agreement and the Community does not accept this offer, the ACP State concerned may charter or lease third country vessels to undertake fisheries activities in its exclusive economic zone and request that such vessels be treated as 'their vessels' under the provisions of this Article.

The Community will recognize vessels chartered or leased by the ACP State as 'their vessels' under the following conditions:

- that the Community has not availed itself of the opportunity to negotiate a fisheries agreement with the ACP State concerned,

-that at least 50 % of the crew, master and officers included, are nationals of States party to the Convention, or of an OCT,

-that the charter or lease contract has been accepted by the Commission as providing adequate opportunities for developing the capacity of the ACP State to fish on its own account and in particular as conferring on the ACP State the responsibility for the nautical and commercial management of the vessel placed at its disposal for a significant period of time.

4. The terms 'ACP State', 'the Community' and 'OCT' shall also cover their territorial waters.

Sea-going vessels, including factory ships, on which the fish caught is worked or processed shall be considered as part of the territory of the ACP States, the Community or the OCT to which they belong, provided that they satisfy the conditions set out in paragraph 2.

Article 3

Sufficiently processed products

1. For the purposes of Article 1, non-originating materials are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the product obtained is classified in a heading which is different from those in which all the non-originating materials used in its manufacture are classified, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3.

The expressions 'chapters' and 'headings' used in this Protocol shall mean the chapters and the headings (four-digit codes) used in the nomenclature which makes up the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (hereinafter referred to as 'the harmonized system').

The expression 'classified' shall refer to the classification of a product or material under a particular heading.

2. For a product mentioned in columns 1 and 2 of the list in Annex II, the conditions set out in column 3 for the product concerned must be fulfilled instead of the rule in paragraph 1.

(a) Where in the list in Annex II a percentage rule is applied in determining the originating status of a product obtained in an ACP State, the value added by the working or processing shall correspond to the ex-works price of the product obtained, less the customs value of third-country materials imported into the Community, the ACP States or the OCT.

(b) The term 'value' in the list in Annex II shall mean the customs value at the time of the import of the non-originating materials used or, if this is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the materials in the territory concerned.

Where the value of the originating materials used needs to be established, the first subparagraph of (b) shall be applied mutatis mutandis.

(c) The term 'ex-works price' in the list in Annex II shall mean the price paid for the product obtained to the manufacturer in whose undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided the price includes the value of all the materials used in manufacture, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be repaid when the product obtained is exported.

(d)'Customs value' shall be understood as meaning the customs value laid down in the Convention concerning the valuation of goods for customs purposes signed in Brussels on 15 December 1950. 3. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1 and 2 the following shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not there is a change of heading:

(a) operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);

(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles, washing, painting, cutting up);

(c) (i) changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of consignments;

(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards etc., and all other simple packaging operations;

(d) affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;

(e) (i) simple mixing of products of the same kind where one or more components of the mixture do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating either in an ACP State, in the Community or in the OCT;

(ii) simple mixing of products of different kinds unless one or more components of the mixture meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating either in an ACP State, in the Community, or in the OCT and provided that such components contribute in determining the essential characteristics of the finished product;

(f) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article;

(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);

(h) slaughter of animals.

Article 4

Neutral elements

In order to determine whether goods originate in an ACP State, the Comunity or one of the OCT, it shall not be necessary to establish whether the electrical power, fuel, plant and equipment and machines and tools used to obtain such goods or whether any materials or products used in the course of production which do not enter and which were not intended to enter into the final composition of the goods originate in third countries or not.

Article 5

Value tolerance

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 (1) and (2), non-originating materials may be used in the manufacture of a given product, provided their total value does not exceed 10 % of ex-works price of the final product and subject to the conditions laid down in Note 4.4 in Annex I.

Article 6

Cumulation

1. For the purpose of implementing this Title, the ACP States shall be considered as being one territory.

2. When products wholly obtained in the Community or in the OCT undergo working or processing in the ACP States, they shall be considered as having been wholly obtained in the ACP States.

3. Working and processing carried out in the Community or in the OCT shall be considered as having been carried out in the ACP States, when the materials undergo working or processing in the ACP States.

Article 9

Sets

Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the harmonized system, shall be regarded as originating when all component articles are originating products.

1. The preferential treatment provided for under the trade cooperation provisions of the Convention applies only to products or materials which are transported between the territory of the ACP States, of the Community or of the OCT without entering any other territory.

Territorial requirement

The conditions set out in this Title relative to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community, the ACP States or the OCT.

- the goods returned are the same goods as those exported, and

-they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported. TITLE II

Article 21

Form EUR. 2

1. Notwithstanding Article 12, the evidence of originating status, within the meaning of this Protocol, of products which form the subject of postal consignments (including parcels), provided that they consist only of originating products and that the value does not exceed ECU 2 820 per consignment, is given by a form EUR. 2, of which a specimen appears in Annex V to this Protocol, which shall be completed by the exporter.

2. Up to and including 30 April 1991 the ecu to be used in any given national currency of a Member State of the Community shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the ecu as at 1 October 1988. For each successive period of two years it shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the ecu as at the first working day in October in the year immediately preceding that two-year period.

3. Revised amounts replacing the amounts expressed in ecus above and in Article 22 (2) may be introduced by the Community at the beginning of any successive two-year period if necessary and shall be notified by the Community to the Customs Cooperation Committee not later than one month before they shall come into force. These amounts shall be, in any event, such as to ensure that the value of the limits as expressed in the currency of any Member State shall not decline.

4. If the products are invoiced in the currency of another Member State of the Community, the importing State shall recognize the amount notified by the State concerned.

5. A form EUR. 2 shall be completed for each postal consignment. After completing and signing the form, the exporter shall, in the case of consignments by parcel post, attach the form to the dispatch note. In the case of consignment by letter post, the exporter shall insert the form inside the package.

Article 22

Exemptions from proof of origin

1. Products sent as small packages to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the production of a movement certificate EUR. 1 or the completion of form EUR. 2, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the conditions required for the application of these provisions, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration.

2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.

Furthermore, the total value of these products must not exceed ECU 200 in the case of small packages or ECU 565 in the case of the contents of travellers' personal luggage.

Article 23

Information procedure for cumulation purposes

1. When Article 6 is applied, for the issue of a movement certificate EUR. 1, the competent customs office in the ACP State requested to issue the certificate for products in the manufacture of which materials coming from other ACP States, the Community or the OCT are used, shall take into consideration the declaration, a specimen of which appears in Annex VI A or B, given by the exporter in the State or OCT from which it came, either on the commercial invoice applicable to these materials, or on a supporting document to that invoice.

2. A separate supplier's declaration shall be given by the supplier for each consignment of materials on the commercial invoice related to that shipment or in an annex to that invoice, or on a delivery note or other commercial document related to that shipment which describes the materials concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.

3. For materials having obtained preferential originating status, the suppliers' declarations shall be given in the form prescribed in Annex VI A.

4. For materials which have undergone working or processing in the ACP States, the OCT or the Community without having obtained preferential originating status, the suppliers' declarations shall be given in the form prescribed in Annex VI B.

5. The supplier's declaration may be made out on a pre-printed form.

6. The suppliers' declaration shall be signed in manuscript. However, where the invoice and the supplier's declaration are established using electronic data-processing methods, the supplier's declaration need not be signed in manuscript provided the responsible official in the supplying company is identified to the satisfaction of the customs authorities in the State where the suppliers' declarations are established. The said customs authorities may lay down conditions for the implementation of this paragraph.

7. Suppliers' declarations made and information certificates issued before the date of entry into force of this Protocol in accordance with Articles 20 and 21 of Protocol 1 to the Third ACP-EEC Convention shall remain valid.

Article 24

Discrepancies

The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the movement certificate EUR. 1, in the form EUR. 2 or in the layout of the supplier's declaration referred to in Article 23 and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the materials shall not ipso facto render the document null and void if it is duly established that movement certificate EUR. 1, the form EUR. 2 or the suppliers' declaration does correspond to the goods submitted.

TITLE III

METHODS OF ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION

Article 25

Communication of stamps

The ACP States shall send to the Commission specimens of the stamps used together with the addresses of the customs authorities competent to issue movement certificates EUR. 1 and carry out the subsequent verification of movement certificates EUR. 1 and forms EUR. 2.

Movement certificates EUR. 1 and forms EUR. 2 shall be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment from the date the information is received by the Commission.

The Commission shall send this information to the customs authorities of the Member States.

Movement certificates EUR. 1 and forms EUR. 2 presented to the customs authorities of the importing State before this date shall be accepted in conformity with the Community legislation.

Article 26

Verification of movement certificates EUR. 1 and of forms EUR. 2

1. Susequent verification of movement certificates EUR. 1 and of forms EUR. 2 shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or the accuracy of the information regarding the true origin of the products in question.

2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Member States, the OCT and the ACP States shall assist each other, through their respective customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of movement certificates EUR. 1 and the accuracy of the information concerning the actual origin of the products concerned and the declarations by exporters on forms EUR. 2 and the authenticity and accuracy of the information certificates referred to in Article 27 (2).

The authorities consulted shall furnish the relevant information concerning the conditions under which the product has been made, indicating especially the conditions in which the rules of origin have been respected in the various ACP States, Member States or OCT concerned.

3. If the customs authorities of the importing State decide to suspend execution of the provisions of the Convention while awaiting the results of the verification, they shall offer to release the products to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.

4. For the purpose of implementing paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing State shall return the movement certificate EUR. 1 or form EUR. 2, or a photocopy thereof, to the customs authorities of the exporting State, giving, where appropriate, the reasons of form or substance for an inquiry. The relevant commercial documents, or a copy thereof, shall be attached to the certificate EUR. 1 or form EUR. 2 and the customs authorities shall forward any information that has been obtained suggesting that the particulars given on the said certificate or the said form are inaccurate.

5. The customs authorities of the importing State shall be informed of the results of the verification within six months. These results must be such as to make it possible to determine whether the disputed movement certificate EUR. 1 or form EUR. 2 applied to the products actually exported, and whether these products can, in fact, qualify for the application of the preferential arrangements.

6. Where the verification procedure or any other available information appears to indicate that the provisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the ACP State on its own initiative or at the request of the Comunity shall carry out appropriate enquiries or arrange for such enquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions and for this purpose the ACP State concerned may invite the participation of the Community in these enquiries.

Where the verification procedure or any other available information appears to indicate that the provisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the products would be accepted as originating products under Protocol No 1 only after the completion of such aspects of administrative cooperation set down in the Protocol which may have been activated, including in particular the verification procedure.

7. Disputes which cannot be settled between the customs authorities of the importing State and those of the exporting State, or those which raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, shall be submitted to the Customs Cooperation Committee provided for in Article 30.

8. In all cases, the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing State shall be under the legislation of the said State.

Article 27

Verification of suppliers' declarations

1. Verification of suppliers' declarations may be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the true origin of the materials in question.

2. The customs authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made to issue an information certificate, a specimen of which appears in Annex VII to this Protocol. Alternatively, the customs authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the exporter to produce an information certificate issued by the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made.

A copy of the information certificate shall be preserved by the office which has issued it for at least two years.

3. The requesting customs authorities shall be informed of the results of the verification as soon as possible. The results must be such as to indicate positively whether the declaration concerning the status of the materials is correct.

4. For the purpose of verification, suppliers shall keep for not less than two years a copy of the document containing the declaration together with all necessary evidence showing the true status of the materials.

5. The customs authorities in the State where the supplier's declaration is established shall have the right to call for any evidence or to carry out any check which they consider appropriate in order to verify the correctness of any supplier's declaration.

6. Any movement certificate EUR. 1 or form EUR. 2 issued or made out on the basis of an incorrect supplier's declaration shall be considered null and void.

7. The procedure laid down in Article 26 (7) shall apply in case of any disputes concerning suppliers' declarations or information certificates.

Article 28

Penalties

Penalties shall be imposed on any person who, in order to enable products to be accepted as eligible for preferential treatment, draws up or causes to be drawn up either a document which contains incorrect particulars for the purpose of obtaining a movement certificate EUR. 1 or a form EUR. 2 containing incorrect particulars.

Article 29

Free zones

The ACP States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that goods traded under cover of a movement certificate EUR. 1 or of a supplier's declaration and which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory are not replaced by other goods and that they do not undergo handling other than operations designed to preserve them in good condition.

Article 30

Customs Cooperation Committee

1. A Customs Cooperation Committee, hereinafter referred to as 'the Committee', shall be set up and charged with carrying out administrative cooperation with a view to the correct and uniform application of this Protocol and with carrying out any other task in the customs field which may be entrusted to it.

2. The Committee shall examine regularly the effect on the ACP States and in particular on the leastdeveloped ACP States of application of the rules of origin and shall recommend to the Council of Ministers appropriate measures.

3. The Committee shall take decisions on derogations from this Protocol, under the conditions laid down in Article 31.

4 The Committee shall meet regularly, in particular to prepare the decisions of the Council of Ministers pursuant to Article 34.

5. The Committee shall be composed on the one hand of experts from the Member States and of Commission officials responsible for customs questions, and on the other hand of experts representing the ACP States and of officials of regional groupings of the ACP States who are responsible for customs questions. The Committee may call upon appropriate expertise where necessary.

Article 31

Derogations

1. Derogations from this Protocol may be adopted by the Committee where the development of existing industries or the creation of new industries justifies them.

The ACP State or States concerned shall, either before or when the ACP States submit the matter to the Committee, notify the Community of its request for a derogation together with the reasons for the request in accordance with paragraph 2.

The Community shall respond positively to all the ACP requests which are duly justified in conformity with this Article and which cannot cause serious injury to an established Community industry.

2. In order to facilitate the examination by the Committee of requests for derogation, the ACP State making the request shall, by means of the form given in Annex IX to this Protocol, furnish in support of its request the fullest possible information covering in particular the points listed below:

- description of the finished product,

-nature and quantity of materials originating in a third country,

-nature and quantity of materials originating in ACP States, the Community or the OCT, or which have been processed there,

-manufacturing processes,

-value added,

-number of employees in the enterprise concerned,

-anticipated volume of exports to the Community,

-other possible sources of supply for raw materials,

-reasons for the duration requested in the light of efforts made to find new sources of supply,

-other observations.

The same rules shall apply to any requests for extension.

The Committee may modify the form.

3. The examination of requests shall in particular take into account:

(a) the level of development or the geographical situation of the ACP State or States concerned;

(b) cases where the application of the existing rules of origin would significantly affect the ability of an existing industry in an ACP State to continue its exports to the Community, with particular reference to cases where this could lead to cessation of its activities;

(c) specific cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that significant investment in an industry could be deterred by the rules of origin and where a derogation favouring the realization of the investment programme would enable these rules to be satisfied by stages. 4. In every case an examination shall be made to ascertain whether the rules relating to cumulation of origin do not provide a solution to the problem.

5. In addition when a request for derogation concerns a least-developed or an island ACP State, its examination shall be carried out with a favourable bias having particular regard to:

(a) the economic and social impact of the decision to be taken especially in respect of employment;

(b) the need to apply the derogation for a period taking into account the particular situation of the ACP State concerned and its difficulties. 6. In the examination of requests, special account shall be taken, case by case, of the possibility of conferring originating status on products which include in their composition materials originating in neighbouring developing countries, least-developed countries or developing countries with which one or more ACP States have special relations, provided that satisfactory administrative cooperation can be established.

7. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 6, the derogation shall be granted where the value added to the non-originating products used in the ACP State or States concerned is at least 45 % of the value of the finished product, provided that the derogation is not such as to cause serious injury to an economic sector of the Community or of one or more Member States.

8. Derogations shall be automatically granted to requests concerning canned tuna, within an annual quota of 1 500 tonnes in the period from the coming into force of the Convention to 31 December 1992, and of 2 500 tonnes per year from 1 January 1993.

Applications for such derogations shall be submitted by the ACP States in accordance with the abovementioned quota to the Committee, which shall put them into force by means of a decision. Above this quota the procedure set out in paragraphs 1 to 7 applies.

9. The Committee shall take steps necessary to ensure that a decision is reached as quickly as possible, and in any case not later than 60 working days after the request is received by the EEC co-chairman of the Committee. If the Community does not inform the ACP States of its position on the request within this period, the request shall be deemed to have been accepted. In the event of a decision not being taken by the Committee, the Committee of Ambassadors shall be called upon to decide within one month of the date on which the matter is referred to it.

10. (a) The derogation shall be valid for a period, generally of five years, to be determined by the Committee.

(b) The derogation decision may provide for renewals without a new decision of the Committee being necessary, provided that the ACP State or States concerned submit, three months before the end of each period, proof that they are still unable to meet the conditions of this Protocol which have been derogated from.

If any objection is made to the extension, the Committee shall examine it as soon as possible and decide whether to prolong the derogation. The Committee shall proceed as provided for in paragraph 9. All necessary measures shall be taken to avoid interruptions in the application of the derogation.

(c) In the periods referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b), the Committee may review the terms for implementing the derogation should a significant change be found to have taken place in the substantive factors governing the decision to grant the derogation. On conclusion of its review the Committee may decide to amend the terms of its decision as regards the scope of the derogation or any other condition previously laid down. TITLE IV

3. Where products wholly obtained in the Canary Islands, Ceuta, Melilla, the OCT or the Community undergo working and processing in the ACP States, they shall be considered as having been wholly obtained in the ACP States.

4. Working or processing carried out in the Canary Islands, Ceuta, Melilla, the OCT or the Community shall be considered as having been carried out in the ACP States, when materials undergo further working or processing in the ACP States.

5. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 3 and 4, the insufficient operations listed in Article 3 (3) (a), (b), (c) and (d) shall not be considered as working or processing.

ANNEX I

NOTES

Foreword

These notes shall apply where appropriate to all products manufactured using non-originating materials even if they are not subject to specific conditions contained in the list in Annex II but are subject instead to the change of heading rule set out in Article 3 (1).

Note 1:

1.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the harmonized system and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an 'ex', this signifies that the rule in column 3 applies only to the part of that heading or chapter as described in column 2.

1.2.Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in column 3 applies to all products which, under the harmonized system, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.

1.3.Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rule in column 3.

Note 2:

2.1.The term 'manufacture' covers any kind of working or processing including 'assembly' or specific operations. However, see Note 3.5 below.

2.2.The term 'material' covers any 'ingredient', 'raw material', 'component' or 'part', etc., used in the manufacture of the product.

2.3.The term 'product' refers to the product being manufactured, even if it is intended for later use in another manufacturing operation.

2.4.The term 'goods' covers both 'materials' and 'products'.

Note 3:

3.1.In the case of any heading not in the list or any part of a heading that is not in the list, the 'change of heading' rule set out in Article 3 (1) applies. If a 'change of heading' condition applies to any entry in the list, then it is contained in the rule in column 3.

3.2.The working or processing required by a rule in column 3 has to be carried out only in relation to the non-originating materials used. The restrictions contained in a rule in column 3 likewise apply only to the non-originating materials used.

3.3.Where a rule states that 'materials of any heading' may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression 'manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No . . .' means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.

3.4.If a product made from non-originating materials which has acquired originating status during manufacture by virtue of the change of heading rule or its own list rule is used as a material in the process of manufacture of another product, then the rule applicable to the product in which it is incorporated does not apply to it.

For example (1), an engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from 'other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging' of heading No 7224.

If this forging has been forged in the country concerned from a non-originating ingot then the forging has already acquired origin by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. It can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or another. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.

3.5.Even if the change of heading rule or the other rules contained in the list are satisfied, a product shall not acquire originating status if the processing carried out, taken as a whole, is insufficient within the meaning of Article 3 (3).

3.6.The unit of qualification for the application of the origin rules shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the harmonized system. In the case of sets of products which are classified by virtue of rule 3 of the general rules for the interpretation of the harmonized system, the unit of qualification shall be determined in respect of each item in the set in the case of headings Nos 6308, 8206 and 9605.

Accordingly, it follows that:

- when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the harmonized system in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification.

-when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the harmonized system, each product must be taken individually when applying the origin rules,

-where, under general rule 5 of the harmonized system, packing is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.

Note 4:

4.1.The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer origin. Thus if a rule says that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of of such material at a later stage is not.

4.2.When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.

For example (2), the rule for fabrics says that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; one can use one or the other or both.

If, however, a restriction applies to one material and other restrictions apply to other materials in the same rule, then the restrictions only apply to the materials actually used.

For example (3), the rule for sewing machines specifies that both the thread tension mechanism used and the zigzag mechanism used must originate; these two restrictions only apply if the mechanisms concerned are actually incorporated into the sewing machine.

4.3.When a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.

For example (4), the rule for heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals or their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not produced from cereals.

For example (5), in the case of an article made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.

See also Note 7.3 in relation to textiles.

4.4.If in a rule in the list two or more percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. The maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.

This note also applies to the value tolerance provided for in Article 5.

Note 5:

5.1.The term 'natural fibres' is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres and is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, the term 'natural fibres' includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.

5.2.The term 'natural fibres' includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.

5.3.The terms 'textile pulp', 'chemical materials' and 'paper-making materials' are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.

5.4.The term 'man-made staple fibres' is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.

Note 6:

6.1.In the case of the products classified in those headings in the list to which a reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 of the list shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in their manufacture which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (but see also Notes 6.3 and 6.4 below).

6.2.However, this tolerance may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:

- silk,

- wool,

- coarse animal hair,

- fine animal hair,

- horsehair,

- cotton,

- paper-making materials and paper,

- flax,

- true hemp,

- jute and other textile bast fibres,

- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,

- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,

- synthetic man-made filaments,

- artificial man-made filaments,

- synthetic man-made staple fibres,

- artificial man-made staple fibres.

For example (6), a yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require the use of non-originating chemical materials) may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the yarn.

For example (7), a woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, non-originating synthetic yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require the use of non-originating man-made staple fibres not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or non-originating woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require the use of non-originating natural fibres), or a combination of the two may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the fabric.

For example (8), tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.

For example (9), if the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.

For example (10), a carpet with tufts made both from artificial yarns and tufts made from cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight taken together does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.

6.3.In the case of fabrics incorporating 'yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped' this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.

6.4.In the case of fabrics incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two films of plastic film, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.

Note 7:

7.1.In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this introductory note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.

Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not to be regarded as trimmings or accessories.

7.2.Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 4.3.

7.3.In accordance with Note 4.3, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.

For example (11), if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.

7.4.Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

on the implementation of Article 178

1. The Contracting Parties to the Lome Convention agree that every endeavour should be made to avoid recourse being had to the safeguard measures provided for under Article 177.

2. Both parties are guided by the conviction that the implementation of Article 178 (4) and (5) would enable them to recognize, at an early stage, problems which could arise and, taking account of all relevant factors, avoid as far as possible recourse to measures which the Community would prefer not to adopt vis-a-vis its preferential trading partners.

3. Both parties acknowledge the need for implementation of the mechanism of advance information provided for under Article 178 (4), the objective of which is to limit, in the case of sensitive products, the risks of sudden or unforeseen recourse to safeguard measures. These arrangements will permit the maintenance of a regular flow of trade information and the simultaneous implementation of regular consultation procedures. Thus the two parties will be in a position to follow closely the trends in the sensitive sectors and detect problems which could arise.

4. The following two procedures result from this:

(a) The statistical surveillance mechanism:

Without prejudice to internal arrangements that the Community may apply to control its imports, Article 178 (4) of the Lome Convention provides for the institution of a mechanism intended to ensure statistical surveillance of certain ACP exports to the Community and thus facilitate the examination of occurrences such as to cause market disturbances.

This mechanism, the sole objective of which is to facilitate the exchange of information between the parties, should apply only to products which the Community considers, in so far as it is concerned, as sensitive.

The implementation of this mechanism will be the subject of a joint agreement on the basis of data to be furnished by the Community and with the help of statistical information to be communicated by the ACP States to the Commission at the latter's request.

For the effective implementation of this mechanism it is necessary that the ACP States concerned provide the Commission, as far as possible on a monthly basis, with statistics relating to their exports to the Community and to each of its Member States of products considered by the Community to be sensitive.

(b)A procedure for regular consultation:

The statistical surveillance mechanism mentioned above will enable the two parties better to follow the trends in trade likely to cause concern. On the basis of this information and in accordance with Article 178 (5), the Community and the ACP States will have the possibility of holding periodic consultations in order to ensure that the objectives of that Article are fulfilled. These consultations will take place at the request of either party.

5. If the conditions of application of safeguard measures as provided for in Article 177 are fulfilled, it would be the responsibility of the Community, in accordance with Article 178 (1) relating to prior consultations concerning the application of safeguard measures, to enter immediately into consultations with the ACP States concerned by providing them with all the information necessary for those consultations, especially the necessary data from which to determine to what extent imports of a specific product from an ACP State or States have caused serious disturbances in a sector of the economy of the Community or of one or more of its Member States.

6. If no other arrangement has been concluded in the meanwhile with the ACP State or States concerned, the competent authorities of the Community may, at the end of the 21-day period provided for in respect of those consultations, take the appropriate measures for the implementation of Article 177 of the Convention. These measures shall be communicated immediately to the ACP States and become immediately applicable.

7. This procedure would apply without prejudice to measures which could be taken in the event of special factors within the meaning of Article 178 (3) of the Convention. In this case all relevant information will be supplied promptly to the ACP States.

8. In any case, the interests of the least-developed, landlocked and island ACP States will receive particular attention, in accordance with Article 180 of the Convention.

9. The ACP States and the Community are convinced that the implementation of the provisions of the Convention, as well as those of this protocol, are likely to promote, while taking into account the mutual interests of the partners, the attainment of the objectives of the Convention in respect of trade cooperation.

Each of the ACP States concerned and the Community shall confer in order to determine the measures to be implemented so as to improve the conditions for the production and marketing of bananas.

The measures in question shall be designed to enable the ACP States, particularly Somalia, account being taken of their individual circumstances, to become more competitive both on their traditional markets and on the markets of the Community. Measures will be implemented at all stages from production to consumption and will cover the following fields in particular:

- improvement of conditions of production and enhancement of quality through action in the areas of research, harvesting packaging and handling,

-internal transport and storage,

-marketing and trade promotion.

Article 3

For the purpose of attaining these objectives, the two parties hereby agree to confer in a permanent joint group, assisted by a group of experts, whose task shall be to keep under continuous review any specific problems arising from application of this Protocol in order to suggest solutions.

Article 4

Should the banana-producing ACP States decide to set up a joint organization for the purpose of attaining the objectives of this Protocol, the Community shall support such an organization and shall give consideration to any requests it may receive for support for the organization's activities which fall within the scope of regional schemes under the heading of development finance cooperation.

Article 2

(a) For the purposes of applying Article 167 and by the derogation from Article 168 (1) of the Convention, the Community shall each year, until 31 December 1995, fix the quantities which may be imported free of customs duties.

These quantities shall be established as follows:

- until 31 December 1993, on the basis of the largest annual quantities imported from the ACP States into the Community in the last three years for which statistics are available, increased, in the period until 31 December 1992, by an annual growth rate of 37 % on the market of the United Kingdom and 27 % on the other markets of the Community.

However, the volume of the annual quantity shall in no case be less than 172 000 hectolitres of pure alcohol,

-for 1994 and 1995, the volume of the total quota shall in each case be equal to that of the previous year increased by 20 000 hectolitres of pure alcohol.

(b)For the arrangements applicable from 1996, the Community shall establish, before 1 February 1995, on the basis of a report that the Commission will send to the Council before 1 February 1994, the modalities for the projected abolition of the Community tariff quota, taking into account the situation and prospects on the Community rum market and of the ACP States' exports.

(c) Where the application of point (a) hampers the development of a traditional trade flow between the ACP States and the Community, the Community shall take appropriate measures to remedy the situation.

(d) To the extent that the consumption of rum increases significantly in the Community, the Community undertakes to carry out a new examination of the annual rate of increase fixed by this Protocol.

(e) The Community declares itself prepared to conduct appropriate consultations before determining the measures provided for in (c).

(f) The Community further declares itself willing to seek with the ACP States concerned measures to allow an expansion of their sales of rum on the Community market.

Article 3

With a view to attaining these objectives, the parties agree to confer within a joint working party whose role shall be to examine continuously any specific problems arising from application of this Protocol.

Article 4

At the request of the ACP States the Community, in accordance with the provisions of Title X, Part Two of the Convention, shall assist the ACP States in promoting and expanding their sales on the Community market.

PROTOCOL 7

on beef and veal

The Community and the ACP States agree to take the special measures set out below to enable ACP States which are traditional exporters of beef and veal to maintain their position on the Community market, thus guaranteeing a certain level of income for their producers.

Article 1

Within the limits referred to in Article 2, import duties other than customs duties applicable to beef and veal originating in the ACP States shall be reduced by 90 %.

Article 2

Without prejudice to Article 4, the reduction in import duties provided for in Article 1 shall apply to the following quantities of boneless meat per calendar year and per country:

Botswana: 18 916 tonnesKenya: 142 tonnesMadagascar: 7 579 tonnesSwaziland: 3 363 tonnesZimbabwe: 9 100 tonnes

In the event of an actual or foreseeable recession in these exports due to disasters such as drought, cyclones or animal diseases, the Community is willing to consider appropriate measures to ensure that quantities affected for these reasons in any year can be delivered in the preceding year or the following year.

Article 4

If, in the course of a given year, one of the ACP States referred to in Article 2 is not in a position to supply the total quantity fixed and does not wish to benefit from the measures referred to in Article 3, the Commission may share out the amount to be made up among the other ACP States concerned. In such a case, the ACP States concerned shall put forward a proposal to the Commission, not later than 1 October of each year, naming the ACP State or States which will be in a position to supply the new additional quantity, at the same time indicating to it the ACP State which is not in a position to supply the full amount allocated to it, on the understanding that this new temporary allocation will not affect the initial quantities.

Article 5

This Protocol shall be implemented in accordance with the common market organization in the beef and veal sector, which, however, shall not affect the obligations entered into by the Community under this Protocol.

Article 6

Should the safeguard clause in Article 177 (1) of the Convention be applied in the beef and veal sector, the Community will take the necessary measures to maintain the volume of exports from the ACP States to the Community at a level compatible with its obligations under this Protocol.

ANNEX I

Joint declaration on the accession of Haiti and the Dominican Republic to the Convention

Having examined the requests from Haiti and the Dominican Republic for accession to the ACP-EEC Convention, the Contracting Parties:

- having regard to Article 289 of the third ACP-EEC Convention,

-confirm that the geographical area of the Convention must remain restricted to the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific,

-note that the requests from Haiti and the Dominican Republic come from the two countries:

- which are geographically part of one of the three geographical areas covered by the Convention,

-whose economic and production structures according to the criteria laid down in Article 289 of the third ACP-EEC Convention are comparable with those of the ACP States that are currently members of the Convention,

-confirm that the accession of Haiti and the Dominican Republic cannot therefore be considered as a precedent for States outside that area and that, for the purposes of the Convention, the Caribbean area includes only States of that area which are already members of the third ACP-EEC Convention, Hispaniola Island and the neighbouring OCT that have become or are in the process of becoming independent,

-agree to retain in the Convention the provisions of Articles 288 and 289 of the third ACP-EEC Convention, the latter Article being qualified by the above definition of the Caribbean area,

-note that the Dominican Republic has given a contractual undertaking not to request accession to the Protocol on ACP sugar and that this undertaking is the subject of exchanges of letters between that country and the Community and the ACP States respectively, annexed to the Protocol on ACP sugar,

-decide in favour of the requests by Haiti and the Dominican Republic for accession to the ACP-EEC Convention.

ANNEX II

Joint declaration on Article 2 of the Convention: interdependence

The Contracting Parties note that their cooperation is marked by the interdependence that characterizes their relations in various areas. The particularly close and lasting relations between the ACP States and the Community leads the Community to regard itself as committed to contributing to its partners' development with all the means available.

Moreover, cooperation is also based on the increasingly closely-linked evolutions of different societies and of their economies. Each is able to offer the other social, cultural and economic enrichment and opportunities in the short and long term.

This mutual contribution shall concern, notably, the development of external markets, access to natural resources, the rational management and exploitation of these resources, the twinning of objectives and efforts by counterparts from the two Parties in the context of decentralized cooperation and cultural exchanges, thereby furthering international understanding and peace.

The Parties shall each for its own part strive to root this notion of interdependence in public opinion.

ANNEX III

Community declaration on Article 2: the ACP States' sovereignty over their natural resources

The principle of the respect of the sovereignty of the partners includes the sovereignty of the ACP States over their natural resources and their right to the development and rational exploitation of the fishery resources and underwater mineral deposits in all waters within their jurisdiction.

So as to ensure effective exercise of that sovereignty, the Community declares its willingness to help the ACP States, using the means placed at their disposal by the Convention, rationally to exploit their resources for the well-being of their peoples. This contribution may in particular take the form of aid for the development and conversion of their production and trade structures as well as the supply of various forms of assistance, including information and scientific and technological equipment, with the fundamental aim of satisfying internal demand within the ACP States and the expansion of regional markets and other external markets.

ANNEX IV

Joint declaration on Article 5: human rights

The Contracting Parties proclaim their determination to work effectively for the eradication of apartheid which constitutes a violation of human rights and an affront to human dignity.

ANNEX V

Joint declaration on ACP migrant workers and ACP students in the Community

I. ACP migrant workers in the Community

1. Each Community Member State and each ACP State will, in the framework of and in compliance with its respective general legislation, grant workers who are nationals of the other party legally carrying out an activity in its territory, and the members of their families residing with them, the fundamental freedoms as they derive from the general principles of international law.

2. The Community will develop its measures to support Member States' non-governmental organizations endeavouring to improve social and cultural facilities for workers who are ACP nationals (such as literacy campaigns and social welfare).

3. The Community is prepared to support, at the request of the ACP States concerned, the financing, within the framework and in accordance with the procedures for development finance cooperation, of programmes or projects to train ACP nationals returning to their countries and for their vocational integration in well-defined fields. These programmes may be implemented in the territory of the Community or of the ACP States with the cooperation of the industries concerned on both sides, concentrating on programmes or projects that would create jobs in the ACP States.

4. The ACP States will take the necessary measures to discourage irregular immigration of their nationals into the Community. The Community may provide them, at their request, with the technical assistance necessary to formulate and implement their national policies on the migration of their nationals.

II. ACP students in the Community

5. The Member States confirm that questions relating to the situation of ACP students within their territory and in particular to issues concerning access to education may be examined in the appropriate bilateral framework.

6. The Community will continue to encourage the training of ACP students in their country of origin or in another ACP State, in accordance with Article 151 (4) of the Convention.

As regards the measures which the Community implements, it shall ensure that the training of ACP nationals carrying out their studies in the Member States is geared towards their vocational integration in their country of origin. For their part, the ACP States undertake to make efforts to programme effectively the vocational integration of their nationals sent to the Member States for training.

III. Provision common to workers and students

7. Without prejudice to national jurisdiction in this field, the Community and the ACP Group of States may each, as appropriate and where necessary, draw the attention of the Council of Ministers to matters relating to foreign workers or students in areas covered by the relevant declarations.

ANNEX VI

Joint declaration on workers who are nationals of one of the Contracting Parties and are legally resident in a territory of a Member State or an ACP State

1. Each Member State shall accord to workers who are nationals of an ACP State legally employed in its territory treatment free from any discrimination based on nationality, as regards working conditions and pay, in relation to its own nationals.

Each ACP State shall accord the same treatment to workers who are nationals of the Member States legally employed on its territory.

2. Workers who are nationals of an ACP State legally employed in the territory of a Member State and members of their families living with them shall, as regards social security benefits linked to employment in that Member State, enjoy treatment free from any discrimination based on nationality in relation to nationals of that Member State.

Each ACP State shall accord to workers who are nationals of Member States and legally employed in its territory, and to members of their families, treatment similar to that laid down in paragraph 1.

3. These provisions shall not affect any rights or obligations arising from bilateral agreements binding the ACP States and the Member States where those agreements provide for more favourable treatment for nationals of the ACP States or of the Member States.

4. The Parties hereto agree that the matters referred to in this declaration shall be resolved satisfactorily and, if necessary, through bilateral negotiations with a view to concluding appropriate agreements.

ANNEX VII

Joint declaration on representation of regional organizations

Arrangements should be made by the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers so that regional organizations of ACP States may be represented, as observers, at sessions of the Council of Ministers and Committee of Ambassadors.

Request for such arrangements shall be examined by the Council of Ministers on a case-by-case basis.

ANNEX VIII

Joint declaration on Article 39 on movements of hazardous waste or radioactive waste

Keenly aware of the specific risks attaching to radioactive waste, the Contracting Parties will refrain from any practice of discharging such waste which would encroach upon the sovereignty of States or threaten the environment or public health in other countries. They attach the greatest importance to developing international cooperation to protect the environment and public health against such risks. They accordingly affirm their determination to play an active part in the work being done in the IAEA to produce an internationally approved code of good practice.

Until such time as a more precise definition is formulated in that framework, the term 'radioactive waste` will be taken to mean any material for which no further use is envisaged and which contains or is contaminated by radionuclides of which the levels of radioactivity or the concentrations exeed the limits which the Community has set itself for protecting its own population in Article 4 (a) and (b) of Directive 80/836/Euratom, as last amended by Directive 84/467/Euratom. As regards level of radioactivity, these limits range from 5 * 103 Bq for nuclides of very high radiotoxicity to 5 * 106 Bq for those of low radiotoxicity. As regards concentrations, these limits are 100 Bq/g-1 and 500 Bq/g-1 for solid natural radioactive substances.

ANNEX IX

Joint declaration on Article 39 on movements of hazardous waste and radioactive waste

The Contracting Parties shall make every effort to sign and ratify as quickly as possible the Basle Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal.

ANNEX X

ACP declaration on hazardous and nuclear and other radioactive waste

The ACP States are seriously concerned about environmental problems in general and the transboundary movement of hazardous, nuclear and other radioactive wastes in particular.

In interpreting and implementing the provisions of the third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 39 (1) of the Convention, the ACP States have expressed their determination to be guided by the principles and the provisions of the OAU Resolution on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal in Africa as contained in Doc. AHG 182 (XXV).

ANNEX XI

Joint declaration on Article 50: available agricultural products

The ACP Group of States and the Community agree to pursue their contracts regarding the supply of available agricultural products to individual ACP States as provided for in Article 50 of the Convention.

The two Parties agree to examine at the appropriate levels ways and means of taking greater account of the specific problems of ACP States in the system of refunds (especially as regards the arrangements for cereals) in the light of the work carried out by the experts' working party under the third ACP-EEC Convention.

A report on the examination carried out as provided for above will be presented to the Council of Ministers within a year of the signing of the Convention.

ANNEX XII

Joint declaration on the location of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation

1. The Contracting Parties recall that, with a view to ensuring the speedy establishment of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation and to avoid delaying the benefits that would accrue to the ACP States from the Centre's operations, it was agreed that the Centre should be situated provisionally in Wageningen, in the Netherlands.

2. The Contracting Parties undertake to examine as soon as possible the subject of location of the Centre in an ACP State, in the light of the experience gained in Wageningen and taking account of the infrastructure and working conditions required to guarantee the Centre's optimum efficiency in carrying out its assigned tasks. The results of the examination will in any case be presented before the expiry of the Convention with a view to a decision on the definitive location of the Centre.

ANNEX XIII

Joint declaration on Article 76: Commodities Committee

The Contracting Parties agree that in establishing the rules of procedure for the Commodities Committee due account shall be taken of the enlarged scope of the committee provided for in Article 47 of the third ACP-EEC Convention and the need to increase its efficiency.

ANNEX XIV

Joint declaration on Article 91: Centre for the Development of Industry (CDI)

1. The Contracting Parties agree that for the appointment of the Director and the Deputy Director of the CDI, the principle of rotation between ACP and EEC nationals shall be institutionalized.

The principle of rotation shall apply after a period of five years, which will be the maximum duration of the term of office of the Director and Deputy Director appointed by the Committee on Industrial Cooperation.

In appointing the Director and Deputy Director, the two parties shall consult on the proposals to be made by either party taking cognizance of the joint nature of the CDI.

2. Each party shall propose to the Committee on Industrial Cooperation three persons as members of the Executive Board.

Wherever possible the members of the Executive Board will be chosen among the members of the Committee on Industrial Cooperation Advisory Council.

3. The authority of the Joint Executive Board vis-a-vis the management of the CDI shall be clearly set out in its statutes.

ANNEX XV

Joint declaration on Article 92 (2): Executive Board of the CDI

The Contracting Parties agree that the ACP Secretariat and the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities shall attend the meetings of the Board.

ANNEX XVI

Joint declaration on Article 127: United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences

In view of the importance of the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences and the desirability of its rapid implementation, the Contracting Parties invite the Member States of the Community and the ACP States who have an interest in shipping and who have not yet adhered to or ratified the Code to do so as soon as possible after signature of the Convention. In this respect, the Contracting Parties recognize that, when the Member States of the Community ratify the Code of Coduct or accede to it, they will do so in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 954/79 concerning the ratification by Member States of, or their accession to, the United Nations Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences.

ANNEX XVII

A. Declaration by the Community and the Member States on Articles 126, 127, 128, 130 and 131

The Community and its Member States interpret the expression 'Contracting Parties` as meaning on the one hand the Community and the Member States, or the Community, or the Member States, and on the other, the ACP States. The meaning to be attributed to this expression in each case is to be deduced from the relevant provisions of the Convention and from the corresponding provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.

B. Declaration by the ACP States on the declaration by the Community and its Member States on Articles 126, 127, 128, 130 and 131

The above declaration by the Community shall not prejudice the provisions of Article 1 of the Convention concerning the definition of Contracting Parties.

ANNEX XVIII

ACP declaration on Articles 126 (2), 127 and 128 relating to shipping

The ACP States wish to reiterate the great importance they attach to shipping services as one of the major forces behind their economic development and the promotion of effective trade between them and the Member States of the Community.

Conscious of the need to ensure that ACP shipping industries are able to participate on an equitable basis in markets which are dominated by powerful international shipping companies, the ACP States reaffirm their view that the provisions of Articles 126 (2), 127 and 128 of the Convention do not imply that such international companies can operate, either in or outside liner conferences, without constraint.

The spirit of the Convention requires that the principle of fair competition is not interpreted solely in favour of such companies, but also takes into account the right of ACP States to greater and fairer participation in all freight generated by their external trade and the need to facilitate the development of their industries.

While the provisions of Articles 86 (2), 87 and 88 of the third ACP-EEC Convention are maintained in the Convention, the ACP States wish to reaffirm their determination to do everything possible within their power, in the context of the Convention, to ensure that any adverse effects on their maritime interests will in future be minimized, while ensuring at the same time that their participation in the bulk cargo shipping is greatly enhanced.

The ACP States also reiterate their view that regional shipping industries designed to consolidate regional cooperation and regional autonomy in sea transport shall develop their activities without undue economic pressure from third country shipping interests.

ANNEX XIX

Community declaration on Articles 126 (2), 127 and 128 relating to shipping

The Community and its Member States acknowledge the importance of shipping services in the context of ACP economic development and the need to continue and develop cooperation in this field.

The objective of cooperation set out in the Convention is inter alia to ensure the development of efficient and reliable shipping services by facilitating the active participation of all parties while acknowledging the aspirations of ACP States for greater participation in international shipping services.

The rules of unrestricted access to the trade on a commercial basis as set out in Articles 126 (2), 127 and 128 exclude restrictive and anti-competitive practices, affecting all shipping companies. The Community and its Member States reaffirm that these rules are designed to increase the competitiveness of shipping companies and thereby benefiting exporters and importers. The Community and its Member States further recall that competitive access to the bulk trade shall not be impaired.

Within this context the Community and its Member States repeat their desire to cooperate fully with the ACP States with a view to improving the efficiency of their shipping industry particularly in the framework of regional development and by way of joint ventures.

ANNEX XX

Joint declaration on the improved use of the trade and services development provisions

The ACP States and the Community reaffirm the need to give greater emphasis to the development of trade and services in the context of national and regional programmes of Community aid.

To this end, without prejudice to the importance of the development of trade in its own right, the ACP States and the Community shall take particular care in the context of establishing programmes, particularly in the fields of agricultural production, rural development and industrial cooperation, to ensure that sufficient weight is given to the need to include a commercial analysis and trade development element in overall programmes.

The Contracting Parties recognize the potential in developing export promotion or marketing techniques for the improvement of the export performance of the ACP States. In this regard, the Commission undertakes to cooperate with the ACP in the development, at an early date, of a trade development project to be financed initially from the sixth European Development Fund. The objective is to establish a focal point in Brussels so as to act as a catalyst and driving force in stimulating promotional work and to identify factors which inhibit the effective use of the provisions of the Convention. To this end the services of qualified persons from ACP or Community sources with a background in ACP-EEC and international trade will be used to achieve these objectives.

ANNEX XXI

Community declaration on Article 136 (3)

In respect of the payment of travel expenses and costs of transporting articles and goods that are to be exhibited on the occasion of participation in fairs and exhibitions, the Community has agreed that, in the case of the least-developed ACP States, such expenses shall be paid direct, at the moment of travel and shipment, by the Commission delegate in the State concerned.

ANNEX XXII

Joint declaration on Article 141 on the ACP-EEC Foundation for Cultural Cooperation

The Community will make a financial contribution available to the Foundation, as part of development finance cooperation, to enable it to discharge its function.

This financial support shall be granted on a multiannual basis to be determined under an agreement protocol to be concluded with the Commission, renewable in the light of the Foundation's achievements and taking account inter alia of the results achieved in the mobilization of external resources other than those provided under the Convention.

ANNEX XXIII

Joint declaration on the definition of 'appropriate technology`

In the framework of the Convention, appropriate technology shall be such technology as:

- is appropriate in terms of labour, capital, operation and maintenance,

-is compatible with the physical environment and the local resource endowment,

-is accompanied by applicable or adaptable know-how,

-satisfies health and safety standards,

-is consistent with cultural and social characteristics of the populations,

-takes into account the social costs of its impact on local culture,

-does not impose a strain on scarce resources, and

-is adjustable to the social and economic conditions.

ANNEX XXIV

Declaration by the ACP States on return or restitution of cultural property

1. The ACP States urge the Community and its Member States, in so far as they acknowledge the legitimate right of the ACP States to cultural identity, to promote the return or restitution of cultural property taken from ACP States and now found in Member States.

2. The ACP States call upon the Member States to recognize that in order to preserve and enrich their cultural identities, the ACP peoples concerned need to recover at least that cultural property which has special significance symbolically and religiously, in other words, culturally.

3. The ACP States call upon the Community and its Member States to help set up an inventory of cultural property from ACP States found in the territory of Community Member States, in public and quasi-public institutes.

4. The ACP States urge the Community and its Member States to facilitate access for ACP States to archives concerning the history and situation of ACP States which before independence had been under their trusteeship.

5. The ACP States request the Community to provide financial and technical assistance for appropriate training activities carried out notably in the preservation and protection of cultural property, including such assistance for the enactment of necessary legislation for that purpose.

ANNEX XXV

Joint declaration on copyright

The Contracting Parties acknowledge that promotion of copyright protection is an integral part of cultural cooperation, the aim of which is to enhance all forms of human expression. Furthermore, such protection is a prerequisite for nurturing and developing production, dissemination and publishing activities.

Consequently, the two Parties shall, in the context of ACP-EEC cultural cooperation, seek to promote and foster respect for copyright and related rights.

In this context, and in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down by the Convention, the Community may offer financial and technical support for disseminating copyright information, training economic operators in the protection of such rights and drafting national legislation for their better protection.

ANNEX XXVI

Joint declaration concerning Articles 145 to 149 on the audiovisual area

1. With a view to the completion of the Community single market, the establishment of the African Common Cultural Market and similar initiatives of the Caribbean and Pacific States, and taking into account the tremendous impact of new information and communications technologies (microelectronics, telematics, direct broadcasting by satellite and cable and high definition television) on the audiovisual area, the Contracting Parties agree:

(a) to explore new forms of cooperation in order to take account of the challenge represented by the growing internationalization of the financing, production, distribution, marketing, training for and development of cultural industries;

(b) to foster synergy, notably through joint productions designed to bring about greater participation in international audiovisual markets with a view to mutual cultural enrichment and a better competitive position.

2. For its part, and by way of an extension to the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention on cultural and social cooperation, and in the spirit of intercultural dialogue, the Community undertakes:

(a) to foster exchanges and dissemination of the cultural products of the ACP States and the Member States in order to promulgate a true image of their culture;

(b) to stimulate and support initiatives of public and private organizations and institutions of the ACP States and the Community that help achieve the objectives set out above.

ANNEX XXVII

Joint declaration on Articles 167 to 170: trade regime

The Contracting Parties recognize that amendments may need to be made to the provisions under the Convention for access for agricultural products in order to take account of the outcome of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations under the GATT.

ANNEX XXVIII

Joint declaration on sugar in the Portuguese market

1. The ACP and the EEC agree, as foreseen in the Protocol of Accession of Portugal to the third ACP-EEC Convention to continue under the appropriate provisions of the Convention and in particular Article 168 (2) (c), the examination of requests made by the ACP States concerning increased preferential access to the Portuguese market for ACP sugar.

2. Having regard to the review of the supply situation on the Portuguese market in 1991, the Community, for its part, undertakes to consult the ACP States prior to taking any decision, bearing in mind the interests of all the traditional ACP suppliers to that market, and the request of the ACP States submitted to the Community before and after the accession of Portugal to the third ACP-EEC Convention and in the framework of the negotiations on the fourth ACP-EEC Convention.

ANNEX XXIX

Joint declaration on trade liberalization

The Contracting Parties note that the Community is conscious of the need to ensure, in the overall application of the Convention, the maintenance of the competitive position of the ACP States where their advantages on the Community market are affected by measures relating to general trade liberalization.

The Community declares its willingness, whenever ACP States bring to its attention any specific case, jointly to study specific appropriate action with a view to safeguarding the interests of the latter.

ANNEX XXX

Joint declaration on Article 181

The Contracting Parties agree that the consultations referred to in Article 181 should take place in accordance with the following procedures:

(i) the two parties will provide all necessary and relevant information on the specific issue(s) in good time to enable an early initiation of the discussions, and in any event not later than one month after the request for consultation is received;

(ii) the three-month consultation period will start from the date of receipt of this information. Within these three months, technical examination of such information shall be completed within one month, and joint consultations at the level of the Committee of Ambassadors shall be completed within two further months;

(iii) if the conclusion arrived at is not mutually acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Council of Ministers;

(iv) in the event that no mutually acceptable solution is adopted by the Council of Ministers, the Council will decide what other steps should be taken in order to resolve the differences identified in the consultations.

ANNEX XXXI

Joint declaration on accession of new Member States to the Community

The Contracting Parties, recognizing that the accession of new Member States to the Community could result in a transitional imbalance of treatment of imports of ACP goods to the new Member State on the one hand and imports from the new Member State to particular ACP States on the other hand, declare that these transitional problems should find an equitable solution in the context of negotiations over the protocol of accession of the new Member State to the Convention. If the outcome of these negotiations is unsatisfactory to one or other party from the point of view of balance, then the Community will examine in close consultation with the ACP State or States affected ways and means necessary to correct the imbalance.

ANNEX XXXII

Joint declaration on cooperation between ACP States and the neighbouring overseas countries and territories and French overseas departments

The Contracting Parties shall encourage greater regional cooperation in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean involving ACP States and the neighbouring overseas countries and territories and French overseas departments.

The Contracting Parties call upon interested Contracting Parties to consult each other on the procedure for promoting such cooperation and, in this context, to take measures, in line with their respective policies and their specific situation in the region, which will permit initiatives in the economic field, including the development of trade, as well as in the social and cultural fields.

Where there are trade agreements involving French overseas departments, such agreements may provide for specific measures in favour of products from those departments.

Issues relating to cooperation in these different areas shall be brought to the attention of the Council of Ministers, so that it can be duly informed of the progress achieved.

ANNEX XXXIII

Joint declaration on the presentation of the Convention to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

The Contracting Parties will consult when the provisions of the Convention that relate to trade are presented and examined under the GATT.

ANNEX XXXIV

Joint declaration on the arrangements governing access to the markets of the French overseas departments for products originating in the ACP States referred to in Article 168 (2)

The Contracting Parties reaffirm that Chapter 1 of Title 1 of Part Three and Title VI of Part Two of the Convention apply to the relations between the French overseas departments and the ACP States.

The Community shall have the right during the life of the Convention to amend, in the light of the economic development requirements of the French overseas departments, the arrangements governing access to the latter's markets for products originating in the ACP States referred to in Article 168 (2).

When examining the possible application of this right, the Community will take into consideration the direct trade between the ACP States and the French overseas departments. Information and consultation procedures shall apply between the parties concerned in accordance with Article 181.

ANNEX XXXV

Joint declaration on products covered by the common agricultural policy

The Contracting Parties recognize that products covered by the common agricultural policy follow specific rules and regulations, in particular with regard to safeguard measures. The provisions of the Convention concerning the safeguard clause may be applied to these products only in so far as they are consistent with the specific nature of these rules and regulations.

ANNEX XXXVI

ANNEX LXII

Joint declaration relating to Protocol 1 on Articles 175 and 177 of the Convention

If special tariff treatment were to be applied by the ACP States to imports of products originating in the Community, including the Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla, the provisions of Protocol 1 would apply mutatis mutandis.

ANNEX LXIII

Joint declaration relating to Protocol 1

1. For the purposes of applying Article 10 (2) (c) of the Protocol, the shipping certificate, issued in the first port of embarkation for the Community, shall be equivalent to the through bill of lading for products covered by movement certificates issued in landlocked ACP States.

ANNEX LXIV

Joint declaration on certain elements of Protocol 1

1. The Contracting Parties call for an expeditious response to requests for verification made by the authorities of the Member States of the Community.

2. The Contracting Parties reaffirm that the rules in the list in Annex II to Protocol 1 should not cause any harm to the preferential trade conditions applicable before the adoption of Decision No 1/89 of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers. Where the rules of origin set down in the list alter the rules in place prior to Decision No 1/89, and it appears that such alteration results in a situation prejudicial to the interests of the sectors concerned, then, if one of the Contracting Parties so requests in the period up to 31 December 1993, the ACP-EEC Customs Cooperation Committee shall examine, as a matter of urgency, the way to restore the substance of the rule as it was before Decision No 1/89.

In any case, the Committee shall take a decision within a period of three months of the request being made to it.

The parties to the Convention shall provide the legal framework necessary to ensure that any customs duties improperly levied on the products concerned imported after 1 January 1990 are reimbursed.

3. The Contracting Parties agree that a manual on the rules of origin for the use of officials and of trade operators concerned shall be established as soon as possible.

They also agree that, in addition, information seminars on the rules of origin will be held within the framework of development finance cooperation.

ANNEX LXV

Joint declaration relating to Protocol 1 on the origin of fishery products

The Community acknowledges the right of the coastal ACP States to the development and rational exploitation of the fishery resources in all waters within their jurisdiction.

The Contracting Parties agree that the existing rules of origin have to be examined in order to determine what possible changes may have to be made in the light of the first paragraph.

Conscious of their respective concerns and interests, the ACP States and the Community agree to continue examining the problem posed by the entry, onto Community markets, of fishery products from catches made in zones within the national jurisdiction of the ACP States, with a view to arriving at a solution satisfactory to both sides. This examination will take place in the Customs Cooperation Committee, assisted, when necessary, by the appropriate experts, after entry into force of the Convention. The results of this examination shall be submitted, within the first year of application of the Convention, to the Committee of Ambassadors and, at the latest during the second year, to the Council of Ministers for their consideration with a view to arriving at a solution satisfactory to both sides.

For the time being, as regards the processing of fishery products in the ACP States, the Community declares that it is willing to examine with an open mind requests for derogations from the rules of origin for processed products in this production sector based on the existence of compulsory landing requirements provided for in fishery agreements with third countries. The examination the Community is to make will take into account in particular the fact that the third countries concerned should ensure the normal market for such productions, following processing, insofar as the latter are not intended for national or regional consumption.

Within this context, and for canned tuna, the Community will examine requests from interested ACP States in a positive spirit, case by case, provided that the economic dossier accompanying each request clearly shows that a case such as those referred to in the preceding paragraph is involved. Taken within the time limits provided for in Article 31 of Protocol 1, the decision will indicate, on a case-by-case basis, the agreed quantities and its duration of implementation, account being taken of Article 31 (10) of that Protocol.

The derogations granted in the framework of this declaration shall not prejudice the rights of ACP States to apply for and obtain derogations granted under Article 31 of Protocol 1.

ANNEX LXVI

Community declaration relating to Protocol 1 on the extent of territorial waters

The Community, recalling that the relevant acknowledged principles of international law restrict the maximum extent of territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, declares that it will take account of this limit in applying the provisions of the Protocol wherever the latter refers to this concept.

ANNEX LXVII

ACP declaration relating to Protocol 1 on the origin of fishery products

The ACP States reaffirm the point of view they expressed throughout the negotiations on the rules of origin in respect of fishery products and consequently maintain that following the exercise of their sovereign rights over fishery resources in the waters within their national jurisdiction, including the exclusive economic zone, as defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, all catches effected in those waters and obligatorily landed in ports of the ACP States for processing should enjoy originating status.

ANNEX LXVIII

Joint declaration on Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol 2

1. A fund administered by the bodies acting for the ACP side as secretariat to the Council of Ministers and to the Joint Assembly shall be set up by the ACP States under those bodies with the exclusive aim of contributing to the financing of expenditure incurred by ACP participants in meetings arranged by the Joint Assembly (excluding its general sessions) and meetings organized by the Council of Ministers between bodies in the Community and the ACP States to establish contacts for the purposes of decentralized cooperation.

-decisions on the organization of working parties or missions and the frequency and venue of the meetings or missions must be taken in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Council of Ministers and of the Joint Assembly.

Community declaration relating to Protocol 2

Having noted the request by the ACP States concerning a financial contribution towards the operating expenditure of their Secretariat, the Community, in the spirit of the relevant undertaking made at the second meeting of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers in Fiji, states its readiness to examine with particular attention the specific requests to be made to it in due course with a view to enabling the Secretariat to avail itself of such personnel as may appear necessary.

ANNEX LXX

Community declaration relating to Protocol 2

The Community, being aware that expenditure in connection with interpreting at meetings and the translation of documents is expenditure incurred essentially for its own requirements, is prepared to continue past practice and meet this expenditure both for meetings of the institutions of the Convention which take place in the territory of a Member State and those which take place in the territory of an ACP State.

ANNEX LXXI

Community declaration relating to Protocol 3

Protocol 3 is a multilateral act from the point of view of international law. However, any specific problems that may arise in the host State regarding the application of Protocol 3 should be settled by bilateral agreement with that State.

The Community has noted the ACP States' requests that certain provisions of Protocol 3 be modified, notably as regards the status of the staff of the ACP Secretariat, the Centre for the Development of Industry (CDI) and the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA).

The Community is willing to seek jointly appropriate solutions in respect of the ACP States' requests with a view to establishing a separate legal instrument as referred to above.

1. show understanding as regards the interpretation of the expression 'staff of senior rank`, such an interpretation to be arrived at by mutual agreement;

ANNEX LXXIII

Joint declaration relating to Protocol 3 on Commission delegations

Within the context of their respective regulations, the ACP States shall grant Commission delegations privileges and immunities similar to those granted to diplomatic missions so that they are able to carry out the functions incumbent on them under the Convention in a satisfactory and effective manner.

ANNEX LXXIV

Joint declaration relating to Protocol 5

The Contracting Parties agree that Article 1 of Protocol 5 does not prevent the Community from establishing common rules for bananas, in full consultation with the ACP, as long as no ACP State, traditional supplier to the Community, is placed as regards access to, and advantages in, the Community, in a less favourable situation than in the past or at present.

Should substantial modifications in this sector, other than a natural fall in banana consumption, take place in the Community, following on the completion of the single European market, the Community undertakes to consult with the traditional suppliers of bananas, taking into account the situation newly created, with a view to safeguarding all legitimate interests of the Parties to this Protocol.

ANNEX LXXV

Community declaration relating to Protocol 5(Geographical cover: Haiti and the Dominican Republic)

Protocol 5 and the joint declaration annexed thereto refer expressly to the ACP States which are traditional suppliers of the Community. The purpose of the Protocol and of the declaration is to ensure the continuation of the special advantages which certain ACP States currently enjoy on the Community market.

Given that the new ACP States party to the Convention do not at present export to the Community, they are accordingly not considered as traditional suppliers.

ANNEX LXXVI

Joint declaration relating to Protocol 6

1. In the event of the introduction of a common organization of the market in alcohol the Community undertakes to consult with the traditional exporters of rum with the aim of safeguarding their interests under changing market conditions.

4. The Contracting Parties note that the Community has agreed to the provisions of Article 4 on condition that:

(a) any ACP State wishing to benefit from these provisions shall include appropriate trade promotion projects for rum in its national indicative programme;

(b) the Community's acceptance does not prejudge the legislation of Member States in matters of alcohol advertising.

ANNEX LXXVII

Joint declaration relating to Protocol 7

Should an ACP State that is not a beneficiary of the Protocol on beef and veal find itself able to export to the Community, that State's problem will be examined in the appropriate framework.

ANNEX LXXVIII

Community declaration relating to Protocol 7

The total quantity provided for in Protocol 7 does not take into account the possible accession of Namibia to the Convention. Should Namibia accede, the Community will examine in a favourable light a solution mutually satisfactory which does not prejudice the interests of present ACP beneficiaries of the said Protocol.
