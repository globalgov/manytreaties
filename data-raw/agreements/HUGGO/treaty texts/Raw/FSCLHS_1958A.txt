of the living resources of the sea, increasing man's ability to meet the need of the world's expanding population for food, has exposed some of these resources to the danger of being over-exploited,considering also that the nature of the problems involved in the conservation of the living resources of the high seas is such that there is a clear necessity that they be solved, whenever possible, on the basis of international co-operation through the concerted action of all the states concerned,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 11. all states have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas, subject (a) to their treaty obligations, (b) to the interests and rights of coastal states as provided for in this convention, and (c) to the provisions

for their respective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas ARTICLE 2as employed in this convention, the expression "conservation of the living resources of the high seas" means the aggregate of the measures rendering possible the optimum sustainable yield from those resources so as to secure a maximum supply of food and other marine products. conservation programs should be formulated with a view to securing in the first place a supply of food for human consumption ARTICLE 3a state whose nationals are engaged in fishing any stock or stocks of fish or other living marine resources in any area of the high seas where the nationals of other states are not thus engaged shall adopt, for its own nationals, measures in that area when necessary for the purpose of the conservation of the living resources affected ARTICLE 41. if the nationals of two or more states are engaged in fishing the same stock or stocks of fish or other living marine resources in any area or areas of the high seas, these states shall, at the request of any of them, enter into negotiations with a view to prescribing by agreement for their nationals the necessary measures for the conservation of the living resources affected.2. if the states concerned do not reach agreement within twelve months, any of the parties may initiate the procedure contemplated by article 9 ARTICLE 51. if, subsequent to the adoption of the measures referred to in articles 3 and 4, nationals of other states engage in fishing the same stock or stocks of fish or

than seven months after the date on which the measures shall have been notified to the director-general of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations. the director-general shall notify such measures to any state which so requests and, in any case, to any state specified by the state initiating the measure.2. if these other states do not accept the measures so adopted and if

a coastal state shall, at the request of that coastal state, enter into negotiations with a view to prescribing by agreement the measures necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the
