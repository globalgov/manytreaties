OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPLES AND ACTORS
CHAPTER 1
Objectives and principles
Article 1
Objectives of the partnership
The Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the ACP States, of the other part, hereinafter referred to as the "Parties" hereby conclude this Agreement in order to promote and expedite the economic, cultural and social development of the ACP States, with a view to contributing to peace and security and to promoting a stable and democratic political environment.
The partnership shall be centred on the objective of reducing and eventually eradicating poverty consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy.
These objectives and the Parties' international commitments shall inform all development strategies and shall be tackled through an integrated approach taking account at the same time of the political, economic, social, cultural and environmental aspects of development. The partnership shall provide a coherent support framework for the development strategies adopted by each ACP State.
Sustained economic growth, developing the private sector, increasing employment and improving access to productive resources shall all be part of this framework. Support shall be given to the respect of the rights of the individual and meeting basic needs, the promotion of social development and the conditions for an equitable distribution of the fruits of growth. Regional and sub-regional integration processes which foster the integration of the ACP countries into the world economy in terms of trade and private investment shall be encouraged and supported. Building the capacity of the actors in development and improving the institutional framework necessary for social cohesion, for the functioning of a democratic society and market economy, and for the emergence of an active and organised civil society shall be integral to the approach. Systematic account shall be taken of the situation of women and gender issues in all areas - political, economic and social. The principles of sustainable management of natural resources and the environment shall be applied and integrated at every level of the partnership.

Article 2
Fundamental principles
ACP-EC cooperation, underpinned by a legally binding system and the existence of joint institutions, shall be exercised on the basis of the following fundamental principles:
- equality of the partners and ownership of the development strategies: for the purposes of implementing the objectives of the partnership, the ACP States shall determine the development strategies for their economies and societies in all sovereignty and with due regard for the essential elements described in Article 9; the partnership shall encourage ownership of the development strategies by the countries and populations concerned;
- participation: apart from central government as the main partner, the partnership shall be open to different kinds of other actors in order to encourage the integration of all sections of society, including the private sector and civil society organisations, into the mainstream of political, economic and social life;
- the pivotal role of dialogue and the fulfilment of mutual obligations: the obligations assumed by the Parties in the framework of their dialogue shall be central to their partnership and cooperation relations;
- differentiation and regionalisation: cooperation arrangements and priorities shall vary according to a partner's level of development, its needs, its performance and its long-term development strategy. Particular emphasis shall be placed on the regional dimension. Special treatment shall be given to the least-developed countries. The vulnerability of landlocked and island countries shall be taken into account.

Article 3
Achievement of this Agreement's objectives
The Parties shall, each as far as it is concerned in the framework of this Agreement, take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising from this Agreement and to facilitate the attainment of the objectives thereof. They shall refrain from any measures liable to jeopardise these objectives.

CHAPTER 2
The actors of the partnership
Article 4
General approach
The ACP States shall determine the development principles, strategies and models of their economies and societies in all sovereignty. They shall establish, with the Community, the cooperation programmes provided for under this Agreement. However, the parties recognise the complementary role of and potential for contributions by non-State actors to the development process. To this end, under the conditions laid down in this Agreement, non-State actors shall, where appropriate:
- be informed and involved in consultation on cooperation policies and strategies, on priorities for cooperation especially in areas that concern or directly affect them, and on the political dialogue;
- be provided with financial resources, under the conditions laid down in this Agreement in order to support local development processes;
- be involved in the implementation of cooperation project and programmes in areas that concern them or where these actors have a comparative advantage;
- be provided with capacity-building support in critical areas in order to reinforce the capabilities of these actors, particularly as regards organisation and representation, and the establishment of consultation mechanisms including channels of communication and dialogue, and to promote strategic alliances.

Article 5
Information
Cooperation will support operation to provide more information and create greater awareness of the basic features of ACP-EU Partnership. Cooperation will also:
- encourage partnership and build links between ACP and EU actors;
- strengthen networking and exchange of expertise and experience among the actors.

Article 6
Definitions
1. The actors of cooperation will include:
(a) State (local, national and regional);
(b) Non-State:
- Private sector;
- Economic and social partners, including trade union organisations;
- Civil Society in all its forms according to national characteristics.
2. Recognition by the parties of non-governmental actors shall depend on the extent to which they address the needs of the population, on their specific competencies and whether they are organised and managed democratically and transparently.

Article 7
Capacity building
The contribution of civil society to development can be enhanced by strengthening community organisations and non-profit non-governmental organisations in all spheres of cooperation. This will require:
- encouraging and supporting the creation and development of such organisations;
- establishing arrangements for involving such organisations in the design, implementation and evaluation of development strategies and programmes.

TITLE II
THE POLITICAL DIMENSION
Article 8
Political dialogue
1. The Parties shall regularly engage in a comprehensive, balanced and deep political dialogue leading to commitments on both sides.
2. The objective of this dialogue shall be to exchange information, to foster mutual understanding, and to facilitate the establishment of agreed priorities and shared agendas, in particular by recognising existing links between the different aspects of the relations between the Parties and the various areas of cooperation as laid down in this Agreement. The dialogue shall facilitate consultations between the Parties within international fora. The objectives of the dialogue shall also include preventing situations arising in which one Party might deem it necessary to have recourse to the non-execution clause.
3. The dialogue shall cover all the aims and objectives laid down in this Agreement as well as all questions of common, general, regional or sub-regional interest. Through dialogue, the Parties shall contribute to peace, security and stability and promote a stable and democratic political environment. It shall encompass cooperation strategies as well as global and sectoral policies, including environment, gender, migration and questions related to the cultural heritage.
4. The dialogue shall focus, inter alia, on specific political issues of mutual concern or of general significance for the attainment of the objectives of this Agreement, such as the arms trade, excessive military expenditure, drugs and organised crime, or ethnic, religious or racial discrimination. The dialogue shall also encompass a regular assessment of the developments concerning the respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance.
5. Broadly based policies to promote peace and to prevent, manage and resolve violent conflicts shall play a prominent role in this dialogue, as shall the need to take full account of the objective of peace and democratic stability in the definition of priority areas of cooperation.
6. The dialogue shall be conducted in a flexible manner. Dialogue shall be formal or informal according to the need, and conducted within and outside the institutional framework, in the appropriate format, and at the appropriate level including regional, sub-regional or national level.
7. Regional and sub-regional organisations as well as representatives of civil society organisations shall be associated with this dialogue.

Article 9
Essential Elements and Fundamental Element
1. Cooperation shall be directed towards sustainable development centred on the human person, who is the main protagonist and beneficiary of development; this entails respect for and promotion of all human rights.
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including respect for fundamental social rights, democracy based on the rule of law and transparent and accountable governance are an integral part of sustainable development.
2. The Parties refer to their international obligations and commitments concerning respect for human rights. They reiterate their deep attachment to human dignity and human rights, which are legitimate aspirations of individuals and peoples. Human rights are universal, indivisible and inter-related. The Parties undertake to promote and protect all fundamental freedoms and human rights, be they civil and political, or economic, social and cultural. In this context, the Parties reaffirm the equality of men and women.
The Parties reaffirm that democratisation, development and the protection of fundamental freedoms and human rights are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Democratic principles are universally recognised principles underpinning the organisation of the State to ensure the legitimacy of its authority, the legality of its actions reflected in its constitutional, legislative and regulatory system, and the existence of participatory mechanisms. On the basis of universally recognised principles, each country develops its democratic culture.
The structure of government and the prerogatives of the different powers shall be founded on rule of law, which shall entail in particular effective and accessible means of legal redress, an independent legal system guaranteeing equality before the law and an executive that is fully subject to the law.
Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which underpin the ACP-EU Partnership, shall underpin the domestic and international policies of the Parties and constitute the essential elements of this Agreement.
3. In the context of a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, good governance is the transparent and accountable management of human, natural, economic and financial resources for the purposes of equitable and sustainable development. It entails clear decision-making procedures at the level of public authorities, transparent and accountable institutions, the primacy of law in the management and distribution of resources and capacity building for elaborating and implementing measures aiming in particular at preventing and combating corruption.
Good governance, which underpins the ACP-EU Partnership, shall underpin the domestic and international policies of the Parties and constitute a fundamental element of this Agreement. The Parties agree that only serious cases of corruption, including acts of bribery leading to such corruption, as defined in Article 97 constitute a violation of that element.
4. The Partnership shall actively support the promotion of human rights, processes of democratisation, consolidation of the rule of law, and good governance.
These areas will be an important subject for the political dialogue. In the context of this dialogue, the Parties shall attach particular importance to the changes underway and to the continuity of the progress achieved. This regular assessment shall take into account each country's economic, social, cultural and historical context.
These areas will also be a focus of support for development strategies. The Community shall provide support for political, institutional and legal reforms and for building the capacity of public and private actors and civil society in the framework of strategies agreed jointly between the State concerned and the Community.

Article 10
Other elements of the political environment
1. The Parties consider the following elements as contributing to the maintenance and consolidation of a stable and democratic political environment:
- sustainable and equitable development involving, inter alia, access to productive resources, essential services and justice;
- greater involvement of an active and organised civil society and the private sector.
2. The Parties recognise that the principles of the market economy, supported by transparent competition rules and sound economic and social policies, contribute to achieving the objectives of the partnership.

Article 11
Peace-building policies, conflict prevention and resolution
1. The Parties shall pursue an active, comprehensive and integrated policy of peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution within the framework of the Partnership. This policy shall be based on the principle of ownership. It shall in particular focus on building regional, sub-regional and national capacities, and on preventing violent conflicts at an early stage by addressing their root-causes in a targeted manner, and with an adequate combination of all available instruments.
2. The activities in the field of peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution shall in particular include support for balancing political, economic, social and cultural opportunities among all segments of society, for strengthening the democratic legitimacy and effectiveness of governance, for establishing effective mechanisms for the peaceful conciliation of group interests, for bridging dividing lines among different segments of society as well as support for an active and organised civil society.
3. Relevant activities shall also include, inter alia, support for mediation, negotiation and reconciliation efforts, for effective regional management of shared, scarce natural resources, for demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants into the society, for addressing the problem of child soldiers, as well as for suitable action to set responsible limits to military expenditure and the arms trade, including through support for the promotion and application of agreed standards and codes of conduct. In this context, particular emphasis shall be given to the fight against anti-personnel landmines as well as to addressing an excessive and uncontrolled spread, illegal trafficking and accumulation of small arms and light weapons.
4. In situations of violent conflict the Parties shall take all suitable action to prevent an intensification of violence, to limit its territorial spread, and to facilitate a peaceful settlement of the existing disputes. Particular attention shall be paid to ensuring that financial resources for cooperation are used in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Partnership, and to preventing a diversion of funds for belligerent purposes.
5. In post-conflict situations, the Parties shall take all suitable action to facilitate the return to a non-violent, stable and self-sustainable situation. The Parties shall ensure the creation of the necessary links between emergency measures, rehabilitation and development cooperation.

Article 12
Coherence of Community policies and their impact on the implementation of this Agreement
Without prejudice to Article 96, where the Community intends, in the exercise of its powers, to take a measure which might affect the interests of the ACP States, as far as this Agreement's objectives are concerned, it shall inform in good time the said States of its intentions. Towards this end, the Commission shall communicate simultaneously to the Secretariat of the ACP States its proposal for such measures. Where necessary, a request for information may also take place on the initiative of the ACP States.
At their request, consultations shall be held promptly so that account may be taken of their concerns as to the impact of those measures before any final decision is made.
After such consultations have taken place, the ACP States may, in addition, transmit their concerns in writing to the Community as soon as possible and submit suggestions for amendments indicating the way their concerns should be met.
If the Community does not accede to the ACP States' submissions, it shall advise them as soon as possible giving its reasons.
The ACP States shall also be provided with adequate information on the entry into force of such decisions, in advance whenever possible.

Article 13
Migration
1. The issue of migration shall be the subject of in-depth dialogue in the framework of the ACP-EU Partnership.
The Parties reaffirm their existing obligations and commitments in international law to ensure respect for human rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination based particularly on origin, sex, race, language and religion.
2. The Parties agree to consider that a partnership implies, with relation to migration, fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on their territories, integration policy aiming at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of their citizens, enhancing non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural life and developing measures against racism and xenophobia.
3. The treatment accorded by each Member State to workers of ACP countries legally employed in its territory, shall be free from any discrimination based on nationality, as regards working conditions, remuneration and dismissal, relative to its own nationals. Further in this regard, each ACP State shall accord comparable non-discriminatory treatment to workers who are nationals of a Member State.
4. The Parties consider that strategies aiming at reducing poverty, improving living and working conditions, creating employment and developing training contribute in the long term to normalising migratory flows.
The Parties will take account, in the framework of development strategies and national and regional programming, of structural constraints associated with migratory flows with the purpose of supporting the economic and social development of the regions from which migrants originate and of reducing poverty.
The Community shall support, through national and regional Cooperation programmes, the training of ACP nationals in their country of origin, in another ACP country or in a Member State of the European Union. As regards training in a Member State, the Parties shall ensure that such action is geared towards the vocational integration of ACP nationals in their countries of origin.
The Parties shall develop cooperation programmes to facilitate the access of students from ACP States to education, in particular through the use of new communication technologies.
5. (a) In the framework of the political dialogue the Council of Ministers shall examine issues arising from illegal immigration with a view to establishing, where appropriate, the means for a prevention policy.
(b) In this context the Parties agree in particular to ensure that the rights and dignity of individuals are respected in any procedure initiated to return illegal immigrants to their countries of origin. In this connection the authorities concerned shall extend to them the administrative facilities necessary for their return.
(c) The Parties further agree that:
i) - each Member State of the European Union shall accept the return of and readmission of any of its nationals who are illegally present on the territory of an ACP State, at that State's request and without further formalities;
- each of the ACP States shall accept the return of and readmission of any of its nationals who are illegally present on the territory of a Member State of the European Union, at that Member State's request and without further formalities.
The Member States and the ACP States will provide their nationals with appropriate identity documents for such purposes.
In respect of the Member States of the European Union, the obligations in this paragraph apply only in respect of those persons who are to be considered their nationals for the Community purposes in accordance with Declaration No 2 to the Treaty establishing the European Community. In respect of ACP States, the obligations in this paragraph apply only in respect of those persons who are considered as their nationals in accordance with their respective legal system.
(ii) at the request of a Party, negotiations shall be initiated with ACP States aiming at concluding in good faith and with due regard for the relevant rules of international law, bilateral agreements governing specific obligations for the readmission and return of their nationals. These agreements shall also cover, if deemed necessary by any of the Parties, arrangements for the readmission of third country nationals and stateless persons. Such agreements will lay down the details about the categories of persons covered by these arrangements as well as the modalities of their readmission and return.
Adequate assistance to implement these agreements will be provided to the ACP States.
(iii) for the purposes of this point (c), the term "Parties" shall refer to the Community, any of its Member States and any ACP State.

ECONOMIC AND TRADE COOPERATION
CHAPTER 1
Objectives and principles
Article 34
Objectives
1. Economic and trade cooperation shall aim at fostering the smooth and gradual integration of the ACP States into the world economy, with due regard for their political choices and development priorities, thereby promoting their sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication in the ACP countries.
2. The ultimate objective of economic and trade cooperation is to enable the ACP States to play a full part in international trade. In this context, particular regard shall be had to the need for the ACP States to participate actively in multilateral trade negotiations. Given the current level of development of the ACP countries, economic and trade cooperation shall be directed at enabling the ACP States to manage the challenges of globalisation and to adapt progressively to new conditions of international trade thereby facilitating their transition to the liberalised global economy.
3. To this end economic and trade cooperation shall aim at enhancing the production, supply and trading capacity of the ACP countries as well as their capacity to attract investment. It shall further aim at creating a new trading dynamic between the Parties, at strengthening the ACP countries trade and investment policies and at improving the ACP countries' capacity to handle all issues related to trade.
4. Economic and trade cooperation shall be implemented in full conformity with the provisions of the WTO, including special and differential treatment, taking account of the Parties' mutual interests and their respective levels of development.

Article 35
Principles
1. Economic and trade cooperation shall be based on a true, strengthened and strategic partnership. It shall further be based on a comprehensive approach which builds on the strengths and achievements of the previous ACP-EC Conventions, using all means available to achieve the objectives set out above by addressing supply and demand side constraints. In this context, particular regard shall be had to trade development measures as a means of enhancing ACP States' competitiveness. Appropriate weight shall therefore be given to trade development within the ACP States' development strategies, which the Community shall support.
2. Economic and trade cooperation shall build on regional integration initiatives of ACP States, bearing in mind that regional integration is a key instrument for the integration of ACP countries into the world economy.
3. Economic and trade cooperation shall take account of the different needs and levels of development of the ACP countries and regions. In this context, the Parties reaffirm their attachment to ensuring special and differential treatment for all ACP countries and to maintaining special treatment for ACP LDCs and to taking due account of the vulnerability of small, landlocked and island countries.

CHAPTER 2
New trading arrangements
Article 36
Modalities
1. In view of the objectives and principles set out above, the Parties agree to conclude new World Trade Organisation (WTO) compatible trading arrangements, removing progressively barriers to trade between them and enhancing cooperation in all areas relevant to trade.
2. The Parties agree that the new trading arrangements shall be introduced gradually and recognise the need, therefore, for a preparatory period.
3. In order to facilitate the transition to the new trading arrangements, the non-reciprocal trade preferences applied under the Fourth ACP-EC Convention shall be maintained during the preparatory period for all ACP countries, under the conditions defined in Annex V to this Agreement.
4. In this context, the Parties reaffirm the importance of the commodity protocols, attached to Annex V of this Agreement. They agree on the need to review them in the context of the new trading arrangements, in particular as regards their compatibility with WTO rules, with a view to safeguarding the benefits derived therefrom, bearing in mind the special legal status of the Sugar Protocol.

Article 37
Procedures
1. Economic partnership agreements shall be negotiated during the preparatory period which shall end by 31 December 2007 at the latest. Formal negotiations of the new trading arrangements shall start in September 2002 and the new trading arrangements shall enter into force by 1 January 2008, unless earlier dates are agreed between the Parties.
2. All the necessary measures shall be taken so as to ensure that the negotiations are successfully concluded within the preparatory period. To this end, the period up to the start of the formal negotiations of the new trading arrangements shall be actively used to make initial preparations for these negotiations.
3. The preparatory period shall also be used for capacity-building in the public and private sectors of ACP countries, including measures to enhance competitiveness, for strengthening of regional organisations and for support to regional trade integration initiatives, where appropriate with assistance to budgetary adjustment and fiscal reform, as well as for infrastructure upgrading and development, and for investment promotion.
4. The Parties will regularly review the progress of the preparations and negotiations and, will in 2006 carry out a formal and comprehensive review of the arrangements planned for all countries to ensure that no further time is needed for preparations or negotiations.
5. Negotiations of the economic partnership agreements will be undertaken with ACP countries which consider themselves in a position to do so, at the level they consider appropriate and in accordance with the procedures agreed by the ACP Group, taking into account regional integration process within the ACP.
6. In 2004, the Community will assess the situation of the non-LDC which, after consultations with the Community decide that they are not in a position to enter into economic partnership agreements and will examine all alternative possibilities, in order to provide these countries with a new framework for trade which is equivalent to their existing situation and in conformity with WTO rules.
7. Negotiations of the economic partnership agreements shall aim notably at establishing the timetable for the progressive removal of barriers to trade between the Parties, in accordance with the relevant WTO rules. On the Community side trade liberalisation shall build on the acquis and shall aim at improving current market access for the ACP countries through inter alia, a review of the rules of origin. Negotiations shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries, and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process. Negotiations will therefore be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors, and the degree of asymmetry in terms of timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in conformity with WTO rules then prevailing.
8. The Parties shall closely cooperate and collaborate in the WTO with a view to defending the arrangements reached, in particular with regard to the degree of flexibility available.
9. The Community will start by the year 2000, a process which by the end of multilateral trade negotiations and at the latest 2005 will allow duty free access for essentially all products from all LDC building on the level of the existing trade provisions of the Fourth ACP-EC Convention and which will simplify and review the rules of origin, including cumulation provisions, that apply to their exports.

Article 38
Joint Ministerial Trade Committee
1. A Joint ACP-EC Ministerial Trade Committee shall be established.
2.

TITLE II
FINANCIAL COOPERATION
CHAPTER 1
Financial resources
Article 62
Overall amount
1. For the purposes set out in this Agreement, the overall amount of the Community's financial assistance and the detailed terms and conditions of financing are provided for in the Annexes to this Agreement.
2. Should an ACP State fail to ratify this Agreement or denounce it, the Parties shall adjust the amounts of the resources provided for in the Financial Protocol set out in Annex I. Adjustment of the financial resources shall also apply upon:
(a) the accession to the Agreement of new ACP States which did not take part in its negotiation; and
(b) the enlargement of the Community.

Article 63
Methods of financing
The methods of financing for each project or programme shall be determined jointly by the ACP State or States concerned and the Community by reference to:
(a) the level of development, the geographical situation and economic and financial circumstances of these States;
(b) the nature of the project or programme, its economic and financial return as well as its social and cultural impact; and
(c) in the case of loans, factors guaranteeing their servicing.

Article 64
On-lending operations
1. Financial assistance may be made available to or through the ACP States concerned or, subject to the provisions of this Agreement through eligible financial institutions or directly to any other eligible beneficiary. Where financial assistance is granted to the final recipient through an intermediary or directly to the final beneficiary in the private sector:
(a) the terms and conditions on which the assistance may be made available by the intermediary to the final recipient or directly to the final beneficiary in the private sector shall be laid down in the financing agreement or loan contract; and
(b) any financial benefit accruing to the intermediary from the on-lending transaction or resulting from direct lending operations to the final beneficiary in the private sector, shall be used for development purposes on the conditions laid down in the financing agreement or the loan contract, after taking into account administrative costs, exchange and financial risks and the cost of technical assistance given to the final recipient.
2. Where the financing is undertaken through an on-lending body based and/or operating in the ACP States, it shall be the responsibility of that body to select and appraise individual projects and to administer the funds placed at its disposal under the conditions provided for in this Agreement and by mutual agreement between the Parties.

Article 65
Co-financing
1. The financial resources provided for in this Agreement may be applied, at the request of the ACP States, to co-financing undertaken in particular with development agencies and institutions, Community Member States, ACP States, third countries or international or private financial institutions, firms or export credit agencies.
2. Special consideration shall be given to the possibility of co-financing in cases where Community participation will encourage the participation of other sources of finance and where such financing may lead to an advantageous financial package for the ACP State concerned.
3. Co-financing may be in the form of joint or parallel financing. Preference shall be given in each case to the solution, which is more suitable from the point of view of cost-effectiveness. In addition, measures shall be taken to coordinate and harmonise operations of the Community and those of other co-financing bodies in order to minimise the number of procedures to be undertaken by the ACP States and to render those procedures more flexible.
4. The process of consultation and coordination with other donors and co-financiers should be strengthened and developed, where possible, through the establishment of co-financing framework agreements and co-financing policies and procedures should be reviewed to ensure effectiveness and the best terms and conditions possible.

CHAPTER 2
Debt and structural adjustment support
Article 66
Support for debt relief
1. In order to attenuate the debt burden of the ACP States and their balance-of-payment problems, the Parties agree to use the resources provided for in this Agreement to contribute to debt relief initiatives approved at international level for the benefit of ACP countries. In addition, on a case by case basis, the use of resources which have not been committed in the framework of past indicative programmes shall be accelerated through the quick-disbursing instruments provided for in this Agreement. The Community furthermore commits itself to examine how in the longer term other resources than the EDF can be mobilised in support of internationally agreed debt relief initiatives.
2. At the request of an ACP State, the Community may grant:
(a) assistance in studying and finding practical solutions to indebtedness including domestic debt, debt-servicing difficulties and balance of payments problems;
(b) training in debt management and international financial negotiations as well as support for training workshops, courses and seminars in these fields; and
(c) assistance to develop flexible techniques and instruments of debt management.
3. In order to contribute to the servicing of the debt resulting from loans from the Bank's own resources, special loans and risk capital, the ACP States may, in accordance with arrangements to be made on a case-by-case basis with the Commission, use the available foreign currency referred to in this Agreement for such servicing, as and when debt repayment falls due and up to the amount required for payments in national currency.
4. Given the seriousness of the international debt problem and its impact on economic growth, the Parties declare their readiness to continue to exchange views, within the context of international discussions, on the general problem of debt, and without prejudice to specific discussions taking place in the relevant fora.

Article 67
Structural adjustment support
1. The Agreement shall provide support for macroeconomic and sectoral reforms implemented by the ACP States. In this framework, the Parties shall ensure that adjustment is economically viable and socially and politically bearable. Support shall be given in the context of a joint assessment between the Community and the ACP State concerned on the reform measures being undertaken or contemplated either at macroeconomic or sectoral level, and permit an overall evaluation of the reform efforts. Quick disbursement shall be an important feature of support programmes.
2. The ACP States and the Community recognise the necessity to encourage reform programmes at regional level ensuring that, in the preparation and execution of national programmes, due consideration is given to regional activities which have an influence on national development. To this end, support for structural adjustment shall also seek to:
(a) incorporate, from the beginning of the diagnosis, measures to encourage regional integration and take account of the consequences of trans-border adjustment;
(b) support the harmonisation and coordination of macroeconomic and sectoral policies, including fiscal and customs areas, so as to fulfil the dual aim of regional integration and of structural reform at national level; and
(c) take account of the effects of net transitional costs of regional integration on budget revenue and balance of payments, either through general import programmes or budgetary support.
3. ACP States undertaking or contemplating reform at the macroeconomic or sectoral level shall be eligible for structural adjustment assistance, giving consideration to the regional context, their effectiveness and the likely impact on the economic, social and political dimension of development and on economic and social hardships being experienced.
4. The ACP States undertaking reform programmes that are acknowledged and supported at least by the principal multilateral donors, or that are agreed with such donors but not necessarily financially supported by them, shall be treated as having automatically satisfied the requirements for adjustment assistance.
5. Structural adjustment support shall be mobilised in a flexible manner and in the form of sectoral and general import programmes or budgetary support.
6. The preparation, appraisal and financing decision for structural adjustment programmes shall be carried out according to the provisions on implementation procedures of this Agreement with due regard to the quick disbursing feature of structural adjustment programmes. On a case-by-case basis, retroactive financing of a limited part of imports of ACP-EC origin may be permissible.
7. The implementation of each support programme shall ensure that the eligibility of ACP economic operators for access to the resources of the programme is as wide and transparent as possible and that the procurement procedures accord with the administrative and commercial practices in the State concerned, while ensuring the best possible price/quality ratio on imported goods and the necessary consistency with the progress achieved internationally for harmonising the procedures for supporting structural adjustment.

CHAPTER 3
Support in cases of short-term fluctuations in export earnings
Article 68
1. The Parties recognise that instability of export earnings, particularly in the agricultural and mining sectors, may adversely affect the development of the ACP States and jeopardise the attainment of their development requirements. A system of additional support in order to mitigate the adverse effects of any instability in export earnings, including in the agricultural and mining sectors, is therefore set up within the financial envelope for support to long-term development.
2. The purpose of support in cases of short-term fluctuations in export earnings is to safeguard macroeconomic and sectoral reforms and policies that are at risk as a result of a drop in revenue and remedy the adverse effects of instability of export earnings in particular from agricultural and mining products.
3. The extreme dependence of the ACP States' economies on exports, in particular from the agricultural and mining sectors, shall be taken into account in the allocation of resources in the year of application. In this context, the least developed, landlocked and island ACP States shall receive more favourable treatment.
4. The additional resources shall be provided in accordance with the specific modalities of the support mechanism as set out in Annex II on Terms and Conditions of Financing.
5. The Community shall also provide support for market based insurance schemes designed for ACP States seeking to protect themselves against the risk of fluctuations in export earnings.

CHAPTER 4
Support for sectoral policies
Article 69
1. Cooperation shall support, through the various instruments and modalities provided for in the Agreement:
(a) social and economic sectoral policies and reforms;
(b) measures to enhance productive sector activity and export competitiveness;
(c) measures to expand social sector services; and
(d) thematic and cross cutting issues.
2. This support shall be provided as appropriate through:
(a) sectoral programmes;
(b) budgetary support;
(c) investments;
(d) rehabilitation;
(e) training;
(f) technical assistance; and
(g) institutional support.

CHAPTER 5
Microprojects and decentralised cooperation
Article 70
In order to respond to the needs of local communities with regard to development, and to encourage all agents of decentralised cooperation which are in a position to contribute to the autonomous development of the ACP States to put forward and implement initiatives, cooperation shall support, within the framework laid down in the rules and national legislation of the ACP States concerned and the provisions of the indicative programme, such development operations. In this context, cooperation shall support:
(a) micro-projects at local level which have an economic and social impact on the life of the people, meet a demonstrated and observed priority need, and shall be undertaken at the initiative and with the active participation of the local community which shall benefit therefrom; and
(b) decentralised cooperation, in particular where such operations combine efforts and resources of decentralised agents from the ACP States and their counterparts from the Community. This form of cooperation shall enable the mobilisation of capabilities, innovative operating methods and resources of decentralised agents for the development of the ACP State.

Article 71
1. Microprojects and decentralised cooperation operations may be supported from the financial resources of the Agreement. Projects or programmes under this form of cooperation may or may not be linked to programmes in the sectors of concentration of the indicative programmes, but may be a way of achieving the specific objectives of the indicative programme or the results of initiatives by local communities or decentralised agents.
2. Contributions for the financing of micro-projects and decentralised cooperation shall be made by the Fund, in which case the contribution shall not normally exceed three-quarters of the total cost of each project and may not exceed the limit set in the indicative programme. The remaining balance shall be provided:
(a) by the local community concerned in case of micro-projects (either in kind or in the form of services or cash and adapted to its capacity to contribute);
(b) by the agents of decentralised cooperation, provided that the financial, technical, material and other resources brought in by such agents shall not normally be less than 25 % of the estimated cost of the project/programme; and
(c) exceptionally by the ACP State concerned, either in the form of a financial contribution or through the use of public equipment or the supply of services.
3. The procedures applicable to projects and programmes financed within the framework of microprojects or decentralised cooperation shall be those laid down in the Agreement, in particular those referred to in multi-annual programmes.

CHAPTER 6
Humanitarian and emergency assistance
Article 72
1. Humanitarian and emergency assistance shall be accorded to the population in ACP States faced with serious economic and social difficulties of an exceptional nature resulting from natural disasters, man-made crises such as wars and other conflicts or extraordinary circumstances having comparable effects. The humanitarian and emergency assistance shall be maintained for as long as necessary to deal with the emergency needs resulting from these situations.
2. Humanitarian and emergency assistance shall be granted exclusively according to the needs and interests of victims of disasters and in line with the principles of international humanitarian law. In particular, there shall be no discrimination between victims on grounds of race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, age, nationality or political affiliation and free access to and protection of victims shall be guaranteed as well as the security of humanitarian personnel and equipment.
3. Humanitarian and emergency assistance shall aim to:
(a) safeguard human lives in crises and immediate post-crisis situations brought about by natural disasters, conflict or war;
(b) contribute to the financing and delivery of humanitarian aid and to the direct access to it of its intended beneficiaries by all logistical means available;
(c) carry out short-term rehabilitation and reconstruction to enable the parts of the population affected to benefit once more from a minimum of socio-economic integration and, as soon as possible, create the conditions for a resumption of development on the basis of long-term objectives set by the ACP country concerned;
(d) address the needs arising from the displacement of people (refugees, displaced persons and returnees) following natural or man-made disasters so as to meet, for as long as necessary, all the needs of refugees and displaced persons (wherever they may be) and facilitate action for their voluntary repatriation and re-integration in their country of origin; and
(e) assist the ACP State in setting up disaster prevention and preparedness mechanisms, including prediction and early-warning systems, with a view to reducing the consequences of disasters.
4. Similar assistance, as set out above, may be granted to ACP States taking in refugees or returnees to meet acute needs not covered by emergency assistance.
5. Underlining the developmental nature of the assistance granted in accordance with this Article, assistance may be used exceptionally together with the indicative programme at the request of the State concerned.
6. Humanitarian and emergency assistance operations shall be undertaken either at the request of the ACP country affected by the crisis situation, the Commission, international organisations or local or international non-State organisations. Such assistance shall be administered and implemented under procedures permitting operations that are rapid, flexible and effective. The Community shall take adequate steps to facilitate speedy action, which is required to meet the immediate needs for which emergency assistance is needed.

Article 73
1. Post-emergency action, aimed at physical and social rehabilitation consequent on the results of natural disasters or extraordinary circumstances having comparable effects, may be undertaken with Community assistance under this Agreement. Such action, using effective and flexible mechanisms, must ease the transition from the emergency phase to the development phase, promote the socio-economic reintegration of the parts of the population affected, remove as far as possible the causes of the crisis and strengthen institutions and the ownership by local and national actors of their role in formulating a sustainable development policy for the ACP country concerned.
2. Short-term emergency action shall only in exceptional circumstances be financed under the Fund where such assistance cannot be financed from the Community's budget.

CHAPTER 7
Investment and private sector development support
Article 74
Cooperation shall, through financial and technical assistance, support the policies and strategies for investment and private sector development as set out in this Agreement.

Article 75
Investment promotion
The ACP States, the Community and its Member States, within the scope of their respective competencies, recognising the importance of private investment in the promotion of their development cooperation and acknowledging the need to take steps to promote such investment, shall:
(a) implement measures to encourage participation in their development efforts by private investors who comply with the objectives and priorities of ACP-EC development cooperation and with the appropriate laws and regulations of their respective States;
(b) take measures and actions which help to create and maintain a predictable and secure investment climate as well as enter into negotiations on agreements which will improve such climate;
(c) encourage the EU private sector to invest and to provide specific assistance to its counterparts in the ACP countries under mutual business cooperation and partnerships;
(d) facilitate partnerships and joint ventures by encouraging co-financing;
(e) sponsor sectoral investment fora to promote partnerships and external investment;

(g) support capacity building for domestic investment promotion agencies and institutions involved in promoting and facilitating foreign investment;
(h) disseminate information on investment opportunities and business operating conditions in the ACP States; and
(i) promote national, regional and ACP-EU private sector business dialogue, cooperation and partnerships, in particular through an ACP-EU private sector business forum. Support for operations of an ACP-EU private sector business forum shall be provided in pursuit of the following objectives:
(i) to facilitate dialogue within the ACP/EU private sector and between the ACP/EU private sector and the bodies established under the Agreement;
(ii) to analyse and periodically provide the relevant bodies with information on the whole range of issues concerning relations between the ACP and EU private sectors in the context of the Agreement or, more generally, of economic relations between the Community and the ACP countries; and
(iii) to analyse and provide the relevant bodies with information on specific problems of a sectoral nature relating to, inter alia, branches of production or types of products at regional or sub-regional level.

Article 76
Investment finance and support
1. Cooperation shall provide long-term financial resources, including risk capital, to assist in promoting growth in the private sector and help to mobilise domestic and foreign capital for this purpose. To this end, cooperation shall provide, in particular:
(a) grants for financial and technical assistance to support policy reforms, human resource development, institutional capacity-building or other forms of institutional support related to a specific investment, measures to increase the competitiveness of enterprises and to strengthen the capacities of the private financial and non-financial intermediaries, investment facilitation and promotion and competitiveness enhancement activities;
(b) advisory and consultative services to assist in creating a responsive investment climate and information base to guide and encourage the flow of capital;
(c) risk-capital for equity or quasi-equity investments, guarantees in support of domestic and foreign private investment and loans or lines of credit on the conditions laid down in Annex II "Terms and Conditions of Financing" to this Agreement; and
(d) loans from the Bank's own resources.
2. Loans from the Bank's own resources shall be granted in accordance with its statute and with the terms and conditions laid down in Annex II to this Agreement.

Article 77
Investment guarantees
1. Investment guarantees are an increasingly important tool for development finance as they contribute to reducing project risks and inducing private capital flows. Cooperation shall therefore ensure the increasing availability and use of risk insurance as a risk-mitigating mechanism in order to boost investor confidence in the ACP States.
2. Cooperation shall offer guarantees and assist with guarantees funds covering risks for qualified investment. Specifically, cooperation shall provide support to:
(a) reinsurance schemes to cover foreign direct investment by eligible investors; against legal uncertainties and the major risks of expropriation, currency transfer restriction, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract. Investors may insure projects for any combination of the four types of coverage;
(b) guarantee programmes to cover risk in the form of partial guarantees for debt financing. Both partial risk and partial credit guarantee shall be available; and
(c) national and regional guarantee funds, involving, in particular, domestic financial institutions or investors for encouraging the development of the financial sector.
3. Cooperation shall also provide support to capacity-building, institutional support and participation in the core funding of national and/or regional initiatives to reduce the commercial risks for investors (inter alia guarantee funds, regulatory bodies, arbitration mechanisms and judiciary systems to enhance the protection of investments improving the export credit systems).
4. Cooperation shall provide such support on the basis of complementary and added value with respect to private and/or public initiatives and, whenever feasible, in partnership with private and other public organisations. The ACP and the EC will within the framework of the ACP-EC Development Finance Cooperation Committee undertake a joint study on the proposal to set up an ACP-EC Guarantee Agency to provide and manage investment guarantee programmes.

Article 78
Investment protection
1. The ACP States and the Community and its Member States, within the scope of their respective competencies, affirm the need to promote and protect either Party's investments on their respective territories, and in this context affirm the importance of concluding, in their mutual interest, investment promotion and protection agreements which could also provide the basis for insurance and guarantee schemes.
2. In order to encourage European investment in development projects of special importance to, and promoted by the ACP States, the Community and the Member States, on the one hand and the ACP States on the other, may also conclude agreements relating to specific projects of mutual interest where the Community and European enterprises contribute towards their financing.
3. The Parties also agree to introduce, within the economic partnership agreements, and while respecting the respective competencies of the Community and its Member States, general principles on protection and promotion of investments, which will endorse the best results agreed in the competent international fora or bilaterally.

TITLE III
TECHNICAL COOPERATION
Article 79
1. Technical cooperation shall assist the ACP States in the development of national and regional manpower resources, the sustained development of the institutions critical for development success, including inter alia strengthening ACP consulting firms and organisations, as well as exchange arrangements involving consultants from both ACP and EU firms.
2. Furthermore, technical cooperation, shall be cost-effective and relevant to the need for which it is intended, and shall also favour the transfer of know-how and increase national and regional capabilities. Technical cooperation shall contribute to the achievement of project and programme goals, including efforts to strengthen management capacity of the National and Regional Authorising Officers. Technical assistance shall:
(a) be demand-driven and thus made available only at the request of the ACP State or States concerned, and adapted to recipient needs;

(g) support intra-ACP technical assistance in order to promote the exchange between the ACP States of technical assistance, management and professional expertise;
(h) develop action programmes for long-term institution building and staff development as an integral part of project and programme planning, account being taken of the necessary financial requirements;
(i) support arrangements to enhance the capacity of the ACP States to build up their own expertise; and
(j) give special attention to the development of the ACP States' capacities in project planning, implementation and evaluation, as well budget management.
3. Technical assistance may be provided in all areas of cooperation and within the limits of the mandate of this Agreement. The activities covered would be diverse in scope and nature, and would be tailored to meet the needs of the ACP States.
4. Technical cooperation may be either of a specific or a general nature. The ACP-EC Development Finance Cooperation Committee shall establish the guidelines for the implementation of technical cooperation.

Article 80
With a view to reversing the brain drain from the ACP States, the Community shall assist ACP States which so request to facilitate the return of qualified ACP nationals resident in developed countries through appropriate re-installation incentives.

The instruments of ratification or approval of this Agreement shall be deposited in the case of the ACP States, with the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union and in the case of the Community and the Member States, with the General Secretariat of the ACP States. The Secretariats shall promptly notify the signatory States and the Community.
3. This Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date of deposit of the instruments of ratification of the Member States and of at least two-thirds of the ACP States, and of the instrument of approval of this Agreement by the Community.
4. An ACP signatory State that has not completed the procedures set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 by the date on which this Agreement enters into force as provided for in paragraph 3 may do so only within the 12 months following that date, without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 6.
For such States this Agreement shall become applicable on the first day of the second month following the completion of these procedures. These States shall recognise the validity of any measure taken to implement the Agreement after the date of its entry into force.

In this context, such countries will be able to draw on the funds provided for in Part 4 of this Agreement for financial and technical cooperation.
By way of derogation from paragraph 4, the countries concerned which are signatories to the Agreement may complete the ratification procedures within twelve months of the restoration of government institutions.

Article 94
Accession
1. Any request for accession to this Agreement made by an independent State whose structural characteristics and economic and social situation are comparable to those of the ACP States shall be presented to the Council of Ministers.
If the request is approved by the Council of Ministers, the State concerned shall accede to this Agreement by depositing an act of accession with the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union, which shall send a certified copy to the ACP Secretariat and notify the Member States. The Council of Ministers may lay down any amending measures that might be necessary.
The State concerned shall enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same obligations as the ACP States.

2. The Council of Ministers shall be advised of any request made by a third State to become a member of an economic grouping of ACP States.
3. The Council of Ministers shall be advised of any request made by a third State to become a member of the European Union. During the negotiations between the Union and the applicant State, the Community shall provide the ACP States with any relevant information and they in turn shall convey their concerns to the Community so that it can take them fully into account. The ACP Secretariat shall be notified by the Community of any accession to the European Union.
Any new Member State of the European Union shall become a Party to this Agreement from the date of its accession by means of a clause to that effect in the act of accession. If the act of accession to the Union does not provide for such automatic accession of the Member State to this Agreement, the Member State concerned shall accede by depositing an act of accession with the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union, which shall send a certified copy to the ACP Secretariat and notify the Member States.
The Parties shall review the effects of the accession of new Member States on this Agreement. The Council of Ministers may decide on any transitional or amending measures that might be necessary.

This shall not apply, however, to the provisions on economic and trade cooperation, for which a special review procedure is provided for. Notwithstanding this time limit, if one Party requests the review of any provisions of the Agreement, the other Party shall have a period of two months in which to request the extension of the review to other provisions related to those which were the subject of the initial request.
Ten months before the expiry of this five-year period, the Parties shall enter into negotiations with a view to examining any possible amendments to the provisions that were the subject of the notification.
Article 93 shall also apply to the amendments made.
The Council of Ministers shall adopt any transitional measures that may be required in respect of the amended provisions until they come into force.
4. Eighteen months before the end of the total period of the Agreement, the Parties shall enter into negotiations in order to examine what provisions shall subsequently govern their relations.

Article 96
Essential elements: consultation procedure and appropriate measures as regards human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law
1. Within the meaning of this Article, the term "Party" refers to the Community and the Member States of the European Union, of the one part, and each ACP State, of the other part.
2. (a) If, despite the political dialogue conducted regularly between the Parties, a Party considers that the other Party has failed to fulfil an obligation stemming from respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 9, it shall, except in cases of special urgency, supply the other Party and the Council of Ministers with the relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. To this end, it shall invite the other Party to hold consultations that focus on the measures taken or to be taken by the party concerned to remedy the situation.
The consultations shall be conducted at the level and in the form considered most appropriate for finding a solution.
The consultations shall begin no later than 15 days after the invitation and shall continue for a period established by mutual agreement, depending on the nature and gravity of the violation. In any case, the consultations shall last no longer than 60 days.
If the consultations do not lead to a solution acceptable to both Parties, if consultation is refused, or in cases of special urgency, appropriate measures may be taken. These measures shall be revoked as soon as the reasons for taking them have disappeared.
(b) The term "cases of special urgency" shall refer to exceptional cases of particularly serious and flagrant violation of one of the essential elements referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 9, that require an immediate reaction.
The Party resorting to the special urgency procedure shall inform the other Party and the Council of Ministers separately of the fact unless it does not have time to do so.
(c) The "appropriate measures" referred to in this Article are measures taken in accordance with international law, and proportional to the violation. In the selection of these measures, priority must be given to those which least disrupt the application of this agreement. It is understood that suspension would be a measure of last resort.
If measures are taken in cases of special urgency, they shall be immediately notified to the other Party and the Council of Ministers. At the request of the Party concerned, consultations may then be called in order to examine the situation thoroughly and, if possible, find solutions. These consultations shall be conducted according to the arrangements set out in the second and third subparagraphs of paragraph (a).

Article 97
Consultation procedure and appropriate measures as regards corruption
1. The Parties consider that when the Community is a significant partner in terms of financial support to economic and sectoral policies and programmes, serious cases of corruption should give rise to consultations between the Parties.
2. In such cases either Party may invite the other to enter into consultations. Such consultations shall begin no later than 21 days after the invitation and shall last no longer than 60 days.
3. If the consultations do not lead to a solution acceptable to both Parties or if consultation is refused, the Parties shall take the appropriate measures. In all cases, it is above all incumbent on the Party where the serious cases of corruption have occurred to take the measures necessary to remedy the situation immediately. The measures taken by either Party must be proportional to the seriousness of the situation. In the selection of these measures, priority must be given to those which least disrupt the application of this agreement. It is understood that suspension would be a measure of last resort.
4. Within the meaning of this Article, the term "Party" refers to the Community and the Member States of the European Union, of the one part, and each ACP State, of the other part.

Article 98
Dispute settlement
1. Any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Agreement between one or more Member States or the Community, on the one hand, and one or more ACP States on the other, shall be submitted to the Council of Ministers.
Between meetings of the Council of Ministers, such disputes shall be submitted to the Committee of Ambassadors.
2. (a) If the Council of Ministers does not succeed in settling the dispute, either Party may request settlement of the dispute by arbitration. To this end, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator within thirty days of the request for arbitration. In the event of failure to do so, either Party may ask the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration to appoint the second arbitrator.
(b) The two arbitrators shall in turn appoint a third arbitrator within thirty days. In the event of failure to do so, either Party may ask the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration to appoint the third arbitrator.
(c) Unless the arbitrators decide otherwise, the procedure applied shall be that laid down in the optional arbitration regulation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration for International Organisations and States. The arbitrators' decisions shall be taken by majority vote within three months.
(d) Each Party to the dispute shall be bound to take the measures necessary to carry out the decision of the arbitrators.
(e) For the application of this procedure, the Community and the Member States shall be deemed to be one Party to the dispute.

Article 99
Denunciation clause
This Agreement may be denounced by the Community and its Member States in respect of each ACP State and by each ACP State in respect of the Community and its Member States, upon six months' notice.

Article 100
Status of the texts
The Protocols and Annexes attached to this Agreement shall form an integral part thereof. Annexes II, III, IV and VI may be revised, reviewed and/or amended by the Council of Ministers on the basis of a recommendation from the ACP-EC Development Finance Cooperation Committee. This Agreement, drawn up in two copies in the Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish languages, all texts being equally authentic, shall be deposited in the archives of the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union and the Secretariat of the ACP States, which shall both transmit a certified copy to the government of each of the Signatory States.

ANNEX II

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF FINANCING
CHAPTER 1
INVESTMENT FINANCING
Article 1
The terms and conditions of financing in relation to the operations of the Investment Facility (Facility), the loans from own resources of the European Investment Bank (Bank) and special operations shall be as laid down in this Chapter. These resources may be channelled to eligible enterprises, either directly or indirectly, through eligible investment funds and/or financial intermediaries.

Article 2
Resources of the investment facility
1. The resources of the Facility may be used, inter alia, to:
(a) provide risk capital in the form of:
(i) equity participation in ACP enterprises, including financial institutions;
(ii) quasi-capital assistance to ACP enterprises, including financial institutions; and
(iii) guarantees and other credit enhancements which may be used to cover political and other investment-related risks, both for foreign and local investors or lenders.
(b) provide ordinary loans.
2. Equity participation shall normally be for non-controlling minority holdings and shall be remunerated on the basis of the performance of the project concerned.
3. Quasi-capital assistance may consist of shareholders' advances, convertible bonds, conditional, subordinated and participating loans or any other similar form of assistance. Such assistance may consist in particular of:
(a) conditional loans, the servicing and/or the duration of which shall be linked to the fulfilment of certain conditions with regard to the performance of the project; in the specific case of conditional loans for pre-investment studies or other project-related technical assistance, servicing may be waived if the investment is not carried out;
(b) participating loans, the servicing and/or the duration of which shall be linked to the financial return of the project; and
(c) subordinated loans, which shall be repaid only after other claims have been settled.
4. The remuneration of each operation shall be specified when the loan is made. However:
(a) in the case of conditional or participating loans, the remuneration shall normally comprise a fixed interest rate of not more than 3 % and a variable component related to the performance of the project; and
(b) in the case of subordinated loans, the interest rate shall be market related.
5. Guarantees shall be priced so as to reflect the risks insured and the particular characteristics of the operation.
6. The interest rate of ordinary loans shall comprise a reference rate applied by the Bank for comparable loans with the same terms and conditions as to grace and repayment periods and a mark up determined by the Bank.
7. Ordinary loans may be extended on concessional terms and conditions in the following cases:
(a) for infrastructure projects in the Least Developed Countries or in post-conflict countries that are prerequisites for private sector development. In such cases, the interest rate of the loan will be reduced by 3 %; and
(b) for projects which involve restructuring operations in the framework of privatisation or for projects with substantial and clearly demonstrable social or environmental benefits. In such cases, loans may be extended with an interest rate subsidy the amount and form of which will be decided with respect to the particular characteristics of the project. However, the interest rate subsidy shall not be higher than 3 %.
The final interest rate shall, in any case, never be less than 50 % of the reference rate.
8. The funds to be provided for these concessional purposes will be made available from the Investment Facility and shall not exceed 5 % of the overall amount allocated for investment financing by the Investment Facility and by the Bank from its own resources.
9. Interest subsidies may be capitalised or may be used in the form of grants to support project-related technical assistance, particularly for financial institutions in the ACP countries.

Article 3
Operations of the investment facility
1. The Investment Facility shall operate in all economic sectors and support investments of private and commercially run public sector entities, including revenue generating economic and technological infrastructure critical for the private sector. The Facility shall:
(a) be managed as a revolving fund and aim at being financially sustainable. Its operations shall be on market-related terms and conditions and shall avoid creating distortions on local markets and displacing private sources of finances; and
(b) endeavour to have a catalytic effect by encouraging the mobilisation of long-term local resources and attracting foreign private investors and lenders to projects in the ACP States.
2. On expiry of the Financial Protocol, and in the absence of a specific decision by the Council of Ministers, the cumulative net reflows to the Investment Facility shall be carried over to the next Protocol.

Article 4
Bank own resource loans
1. The Bank shall:
(a) contribute, through the resources it manages, to the economic and industrial development of the ACP States on a national and regional basis; and to this end, finance as a priority productive projects and programmes or other investments aimed at promoting the private sector in all economic sectors;
(b) establish close cooperation links with national and regional development banks and with banking and financial institutions of the ACP States and of the EU; and
(c) in consultation with the ACP State concerned, adapt the arrangements and procedures for implementing development finance cooperation, as set out in this Agreement, if necessary, to take account of the nature of the projects and programmes and to act in accordance with the objectives of this Agreement, within the framework of the procedures laid down by its statute.
2. Loans from the Bank's own resources shall be granted under the following terms and conditions:
(a) the reference rate of interest shall be the rate applied by the Bank for a loan with the same conditions as to currency, and repayment period on the day of signature of the contract or on the date of disbursement;
(b) however:
(i) in principle, public sector projects shall be eligible for an interest rate subsidy of 3 %;
(ii) private sector projects falling into the categories specified in Article 2 (7)(b) shall be eligible for interest rates subsidies on the same terms as those specified in Article 2(7)(b).
The final interest rate shall, in any case, never be less than 50 % of the reference rate.
(c) the amount of the interest rate subsidy calculated in terms of its value at the times of disbursement of the loan shall be charged against the interest subsidy allocation of the Investment Facility as defined in Article 2(8) and 2(9), and paid directly to the Bank; and
(d) the repayment period of loans made by the Bank from its own resources shall be determined on the basis of the economic and financial characteristics of the project, but may not exceed 25 years. These loans shall normally comprise a grace period fixed by reference to the construction period of the project.
3. For investments financed by the Bank from its own resources in public sector companies, specific project-related guarantees or undertakings may be required from the ACP State concerned.

Article 5
Conditions for foreign exchange rate risk
In order to minimise the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, the problems of exchange rate risk shall be dealt with in the following way:
(a) in the case of equity participation designed to strengthen an enterprise's own funds, the exchange rate risk shall, as a general rule, be borne by the Investment Facility;
(b) in the case of risk capital financing for small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the exchange rate risk shall, as a general rule, be shared by the Community, on the one part, and by the other parties involved, on the other. On average, the foreign exchange rate risk shall be shared equally; and
(c) where feasible and appropriate, particularly in countries characterised by macroeconomic and financial stability, the Facility will endeavour to extend loans in local ACP currencies, thus de facto taking the foreign exchange risk.

Article 6
Conditions for foreign exchange transfer
The ACP States concerned shall, in respect of operations under the Agreement, and in respect of which they have given their written approval within the framework of this Agreement:
(a) grant exemption from all national or local duties, fiscal charges on interest, commission and amortisation of loans due in accordance with the law or laws of the ACP State or States concerned;
(b) place at the disposal of the beneficiaries the currency necessary for the payment of interest, commission and the amortisation of loans due in terms of financing contracts granted for the implementation of projects and programmes on their territories; and
(c) make available to the Bank the foreign currency necessary for the transfer of all sums received by it in national currency at the exchange rate applicable between the Euro or other currencies of transfer and the national currency at the date of the transfer. These include all forms of remuneration, such as, inter alia, interest, dividends, commissions and fees, as well as the amortisation of loans and the proceeds from the sale of shares due in terms of financing contracts granted for the implementation of projects and programmes on their territories.

CHAPTER 2
SPECIAL OPERATIONS
Article 7
1. Cooperation shall support from the grant allocation:
(a) low-income housing to promote long-term development of the housing sector, including secondary mortgage facilities;
(b) micro-finance to promote SMEs and micro-enterprises; and
(c) capacity building to strengthen and facilitate the effective participation of the private sector in social and economic development.
2. The ACP-EC Council of Ministers shall, after the signature of this Agreement and on a proposal by the ACP-EC Development Finance Cooperation Committee, decide on the modalities and the amount of resources allocated from the long-term development envelope to attain these objectives.

CHAPTER 3
FINANCING FOR SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN EXPORT EARNINGS
Article 8
1. The Parties recognise that losses of export earnings as a result of short-term fluctuations may jeopardise the development financing requirements and the implementation of macroeconomic and sectoral policies. The degree of dependence of an ACP State's economy on the export of goods, and in particular from agricultural and mining products shall, therefore, be a criterion for determining the allocation of long-term development.
2. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of instability of export earnings and safeguard the development programme jeopardised by the drop in revenue, additional financial support may be mobilised from the programmable resources for the country's long-term development on the basis of Articles 9 and 10.

Article 9
Eligibility criteria
1. Eligibility for additional resources shall be established by:
a) - a 10 % (2 % in the case of least-developed countries) loss of export earnings from goods compared with the arithmetical average of the earnings in the first three years of the first four years preceding the application year;
- or
- a 10 % (2 % in the case of least-developed countries ) loss of export earnings from the total of agricultural or mineral products compared with the arithmetical average of the earnings in the first three years of the first four years preceding the application year for countries where the agricultural or mineral export revenues represent more than 40 % of total export revenues from goods; and
(b) a 10 % worsening in the programmed public deficit programmed for the year in question or forecast for the following year.
2. Entitlement to additional support shall be limited to four successive years.
3. The additional resources shall be reflected in the public accounts of the country concerned. They shall be utilised in accordance with programming rules and methods including the specific provisions in Annex IV "Implementation and management procedures", on the basis of agreements drawn up in advance between the Community and the ACP State concerned in the year following the application. By agreement of both Parties the resources may be used to finance programmes included in national budget. However a part of the additional resources may also be set aside for specific sectors.

Article 1 0
Advances
The system for allocating additional resources shall provide for advances to cover any delays in obtaining consolidated trade statistics and to ensure that the resources in question can be included in the budget of the year following the application year. Advances shall be mobilised on the basis of provisional export statistics drawn up by the government and submitted to the Commission in advance of the official final consolidated statistics. The maximum advance shall be 80 % of the estimated amount of additional resources for the application year. The amounts thus mobilised shall be adjusted by common agreement between the Commission and the government in the light of final consolidated export statistics and the final figure of the public deficit.

Article 1 1
The provisions in this Chapter shall be subject to review at the latest after two years of operation and subsequently at the request of either Party..

CHAPTER 4
OTHER PROVISIONS
Article 12
Current payments and capital movements
1. Without prejudice to paragraph 3 hereafter, the Parties undertake to impose no restrictions on any payments, in freely convertible currency, on the current account of balance of payments between residents of the Community and of the ACP States.
2. With regard to transactions on the capital account of balance of payments, the Parties undertake to impose no restrictions on the free movement of capital relating to direct investments made in companies formed in accordance with the law of the host country and investments made in accordance with this Agreement, and the liquidation or repatriation of these investments and of any profit stemming therefrom.
3. Where one or more ACP State or one or more Member State of the Community is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under threat thereof, the ACP State, the Member State or the Community may, in accordance with the conditions established under the GATT, GATS and Article VIII and XIV of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, adopt restrictions on current transactions which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Party taking the measures shall inform the other Parties forthwith and shall submit to them as soon as possible a timetable for the elimination of the measures concerned.

Article 13
Qualification and treatment of business entities
As regards arrangements that may be applied in matters of establishment and provision of services, the ACP States, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other, shall treat nationals and companies or firms of the ACP States and nationals and companies or firms of the Member States respectively on a non-discriminatory basis. However, if, for a given activity, an ACP State or a Member State is unable to provide such treatment, the ACP State or the Member State, as the case may be, shall not be bound to accord such treatment for that activity to the nationals and companies or firms of the State concerned.

Article 14
Definition of "companies and firms"
1. For the purpose of this Agreement, "companies or firms of a Member State or an ACP State" mean companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including corporations, whether public or otherwise, cooperative societies and other legal persons and partnerships governed by public or private law, save for those which are non-profit-making, formed in accordance with the law of a Member State or an ACP State and whose statutory office, central administration or principal place of business is a Member State or an ACP State.
2. However, a company or firm having only its statutory office in a Member State or an ACP State must be engaged in an activity which has an effective and continuous link with the economy of that Member State or ACP State.

CHAPTER 5
INVESTMENT PROTECTION AGREEMENTS

The Contracting Parties confirm that retroactivity shall not apply as a general principle unless Contracting States stipulate otherwise.
2. With a view to facilitating the negotiation of bilateral agreements on investment promotion and protection, the Contracting Parties agree to study the main clauses of a model protection agreement. The study, drawing on the provisions of the existing bilateral agreements between the States Parties, will give particular attention to the following issues:
(a) legal guarantees to ensure fair and equitable treatment and protection of foreign investors;
(b) the most-favoured-investor clause;
(c) protection in the event of expropiation and nationalisation;
(d) the transfer of capital and profits, and

ANNEX IV

IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES
CHAPTER 1
PROGRAMMING (NATIONAL)
Article 1
Operations financed by grants within the framework of this Agreement shall be programmed at the beginning of the period covered by the Financial Protocol. Programming for this purpose shall mean:
(a) the preparation and development of a Country Support Strategy (CSS) based on the country's own medium-term development objectives and strategies;
(b) a clear indication from the Community of the indicative programmable financial allocation from which the country may benefit during the five-year period as well as any other relevant information;
(c) the preparation and adoption of an indicative programme for implementing the CSS; and
(d) a review process covering the CSS, the indicative programme and the volume of resources allocated to it.

Article 2
Country support strategy
The CSS shall be prepared by the ACP State concerned and the EU following consultations with a wide range of actors in the development process, and shall draw on lessons learned and best practices. Each CSS shall be adapted to the needs and respond to the specific circumstances of each ACP State. The CSS shall be an instrument to prioritise activities and to build local ownership of cooperation programmes. Any divergences between the country's own analysis and that of the Community shall be noted. The CSS shall include the following standard elements:
(a) an analysis of the political, economic and social country context, constraints, capacities and prospects including an assessment of basic needs, such as income per capita, population size and social indicators, and vulnerability;
(b) a detailed outline of the country's medium-term development strategy, clearly defined priorities and expected financing requirements;
(c) an outline of relevant plans and actions of other donors present in the country, in particular including those of the EU Member States in their capacity as bilateral donors;
(d) response strategies, detailing the specific contribution the EU can provide. These shall, to the extent possible, enable complementarity with operations financed by the ACP State itself and by other donors present in the country; and
(e) a definition of the nature and scope of the most appropriate support mechanisms to be applied in implementing the above strategies.

Article 3
Resource allocation
1. Resource allocation shall be based on needs and performance, as defined in this Agreement. In this context:
(a) needs shall be assessed on the basis of criteria pertaining to per capita income, population size, social indicators and level of indebtedness, export earning losses and dependence on export earnings, in particular from the sectors of agriculture and mining. Special treatment shall be accorded to the least developed ACP States and the vulnerability of island and landlocked states shall duly be taken into account. In addition, account shall be taken of the particular difficulties of post-conflict countries; and
(b) performance shall be assessed in an objective and transparent manner on the basis of the following parameters: progress in implementing institutional reforms, country performance in the use of resources, effective implementation of current operations, poverty alleviation or reduction, sustainable development measures and macroeconomic and sectoral policy performance.
2. The allocated resources shall comprise two elements:
(a) an allocation to cover macroeconomic support, sectoral policies, programmes and projects in support of the focal or non focal areas of Community assistance; and
(b) an allocation to cover unforeseen needs such as emergency assistance where such support cannot be financed from the EU budget, contributions to internationally agreed debt relief initiatives and support to mitigate adverse effects of instability in export earnings.
3. This indicative amount shall facilitate the long-term programming of Community aid for the country concerned. Together with the uncommitted balances of resources allocated to the country under previous EDF, and wherever possible Community budget resources, these allocations shall be the basis for the preparation of the indicative programme for the country concerned.
4. Provision will be made for those countries which, due to exceptional circumstances, can not access normal programmable resources.

Article 4
Preparation and adoption of the indicative programme
1. Upon receipt of the information referred to above, each ACP State shall draw up and submit to the Community a draft indicative programme on the basis of and consistent with its development objectives and priorities as expressed in the CSS. The draft indicative programme shall contain:
(a) the focal sector, sectors or areas on which support should be concentrated;
(b) the most appropriate measures and operations for attaining the objectives and targets in the focal sector, sectors or areas;
(c) the resources reserved for projects and programmes outside the focal sector(s) and/or the broad outlines of such activities, as well as an indication of the resources to be deployed for each of these elements;
(d) identification of eligible non-State actors and the resources allocated for non-State actors;
(e) proposals for regional projects and programmes; and
(f) a reserve for insurance against possible claims and to cover cost increases and contingencies.
2. The draft indicative programme shall, as appropriate, contain the resources reserved to reinforce human, material and institutional ACP capacity for preparing and implementing national and regional indicative programmes and for improving the management of the ACP States' public investment projects cycle.
3. The draft indicative programme shall be the subject of an exchange of views between the ACP State concerned and the Community. The indicative programme shall be adopted by common agreement between the Community and the ACP State concerned. It shall, when adopted, be binding on both the Community and that State. This indicative programme shall be annexed to the CSS and shall in addition contain:
(a) specific and clearly identified operations, especially those that can be committed before the next review;
(b) a timetable for implementation and review of the indicative programme, including commitments and disbursements of resources; and
(c) the parameters and criteria for the reviews.
4. The Community and the ACP State concerned shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the programming process is completed within the shortest possible time and, save in exceptional circumstances, within twelve months of the signing of the Financial Protocol. In this context, the preparation of the CSS and the indicative programme must be part of a continuous process leading to the adoption of a single document.

Article 5
Review process
1. Financial cooperation between the ACP State and the Community shall be sufficiently flexible to ensure that operations are kept constantly in line with the objectives of this Agreement and to take account of any changes occurring in the economic situation, priorities and objectives of the ACP State concerned. In this context, the National Authorising Officer and the Head of Delegation shall:
(a) annually undertake an operational review of the indicative programme; and
(b) undertake a mid-term and end-of-term review of the CSS and the indicative programme in the light of current needs and performance.
2. In exceptional circumstances referred to in the provisions on humanitarian and emergency assistance, the review can be carried out on the demand of either Party.
3. The National Authorising Officer and the Head of Delegation shall:
(a) take all necessary measures to ensure adherence to the provisions of the indicative programme, including ensuring that the timetable of commitments and disbursements agreed at the time of programming is adhered to; and
(b) determine any causes of delay in implementation and propose suitable measures to remedy the situation.
4. The annual operational review of the indicative programme shall consist of a joint assessment of the implementation of the programme and take into account the results of relevant activities of monitoring and evaluation. This review shall be conducted locally and shall be finalised between the National Authorising Officer and the Head of Delegation within a period of 60 days. It shall in particular cover an assessment of:
(a) the results achieved in the focal sector(s) measured against the identified targets and impact indicators and sectoral policy commitments;
(b) projects and programmes outside the focal sector(s) and/or in the framework of multi-annual programmes;
(c) the use of resources set aside for non-State actors;
(d) the effectiveness in implementation of current operations and the extent to which the timetable for commitments and payments have been respected; and
(e) an extension of the programming perspective for the following years.
5. The National Authorising Officer and the Head of Delegation shall submit the report on the conclusion of the annual review to the Development Finance Cooperation Committee, within 30 days of the completion of the operational review. The Committee shall examine the report in accordance with its responsibilities and powers under the Agreement.
6. In the light of the annual operational reviews, the National Authorising Officer and the Head of Delegation may at the mid-term and end-of-term reviews, and within the above time frames, review and adapt the CSS:
(a) where operational reviews indicate specific problems; and/or
(b) in the light of changed circumstances of an ACP State.
Such reviews shall be completed within a further period of 30 days of the finalisation of the mid-term and end-of-term reviews. The end of Financial Protocol review shall also include adaptation for the new financial protocol in terms of both resource allocation and preparation for the next programme.
7. Following the completion of mid-term and end-of-term reviews, the Community may revise the resource allocation in the light of current needs and performance of the ACP State concerned.

CHAPTER 2
PROGRAMMING AND PREPARATION (REGIONAL)
Article 6
Participation
1. Regional cooperation shall cover operations benefiting and involving:
(a) two or more or all ACP States; and/or
(b) a regional body of which at least two ACP States are members.
2. Regional cooperation can also involve Overseas Countries and Territories and outermost regions. The funding to enable participation of these territories shall be additional to funds allocated to the ACP States under the Agreement.

Article 7
Regional programmes
The ACP States concerned shall decide on the definition of geographical regions. To the maximum extent possible, regional integration programmes should correspond to programmes of existing regional organisations with a mandate for economic integration. In principle, in case the membership of several relevant regional organisations overlaps, the regional integration programme should correspond to the combined membership of these organisations. In this context, the Community will provide specific support from regional programmes to groups of ACP States who are committed to negotiate economic partnership agreements with the EU.

Article 8
Regional programming
1. Programming shall take place at the level of each region. The programming shall be a result of an exchange of views between the Commission and the duly mandated regional organisation(s) concerned, and in the absence of such a mandate, the National Authorising Officers of the countries in that region. Where appropriate, programming may include a consultation with eligible non-State actors.
2. Programming for this purpose shall mean:
(a) preparation and development of a Regional Support Strategy (RSS) based on the region's own medium-term development objectives and strategies;
(b) a clear indication from the Community of the indicative resource allocation from which the region may benefit during the five-year period as well as any other relevant information;
(c) preparation and adoption of a Regional Indicative Programme (RIP) for implementing the RSS; and
(d) a review process covering the RSS, the RIP and the volume of resources allocated to each region.
3. The RSS shall be prepared by the Commission and the duly mandated regional organisation(s) in collaboration with the ACP States in the region concerned. The RSS will be an instrument to prioritise activities and to build local ownership of supported programmes. The RSS shall include the following standard elements:
(a) an analysis of the political, economic and social context of the region;
(b) an assessment of the process and prospects of regional economic integration and integration into the world economy;
(c) an outline of the regional strategies and priorities pursued and the expected financing requirements;
(d) an outline of relevant activities of other external partners in regional cooperation; and
(e) an outline of the specific EU contribution towards achievement of the goals for regional cooperation and integration, complementary insofar as possible to operations financed by the ACP States themselves and by other external partners, particularly the EU Member States.

Article 9
Resource allocation
At the beginning of the period covered by the Financial Protocol, each region shall receive from the Community an indication of the volume of resources from which it may benefit during a five-year period. The indicative resource allocation shall be based on an estimate of need and the progress and prospects in the process of regional cooperation and integration. In order to achieve an adequate scale and to increase efficiency, regional and national funds may be mixed for financing regional operations with a distinct national component.

Article 10
Regional indicative programme
1. On the basis of the resource allocation indicated above, the duly mandated regional organisation(s), and in the absence of such a mandate, the National Authorising Officers of the countries in the region, shall draw up a draft Regional Indicative Programme. In particular, the draft programme shall specify:
(a) the focal sectors and themes of Community aid;
(b) the most appropriate measures and operations to achieve the objectives set for those sectors and themes; and
(c) the projects and programmes enabling those objectives to be attained, insofar as they have been clearly identified as well as an indication of the resources to be deployed for each of these elements and a timetable for their implementation.
2. The Regional Indicative Programmes shall be adopted by common agreement between the Community and the ACP States concerned.

Article 11
Review process
Financial cooperation between each ACP region and the Community shall be sufficiently flexible to ensure that operations are kept constantly in line with the objectives of this Agreement and to take account of any changes occurring in the economic situation, priorities and objectives of the region concerned. A mid-term and end-of-term review of the regional indicative programmes shall be undertaken to adapt the indicative programme to evolving circumstances and to ensure that they are correctly implemented. Following the completion of mid-term and end-of-term reviews, the Community may revise the resource allocation in the light of current needs and performance.

Article 12
Intra-ACP cooperation
At the beginning of the period covered by the Financial Protocol, the Community shall indicate to the ACP Council of Ministers the part of the funds earmarked for regional operations that shall be set aside for operations that benefit many or all ACP States. Such operations may transcend the concept of geographic location.

Article 13
Requests for financing
1. Requests for financing of regional programmes shall be submitted by:
(a) a duly mandated regional body or organisation; or
(b) a duly mandated sub-regional body, organisation or an ACP State in the region concerned at the programming stage, provided that the operation has been identified in the RIP.
2. Requests for intra-ACP programmes shall be submitted by:
(a) at least 3 mandated regional bodies or organisations belonging to different geographic regions, or the National Authorising Officers of such regions; or
(b) the ACP Council of Ministers, or, by specific delegation, the ACP Committee of Ambassadors; or
(c) international organisations carrying out operations that contribute to the objectives of regional cooperation and integration, subject to prior approval by the ACP Committee of Ambassadors.

Article 14
Procedures for implementation
1. Regional programmes shall be implemented by the requesting body or any other duly authorised institution or body.
2. Intra-ACP programmes shall be implemented by the requesting body or their duly authorised agent. In the absence of a duly authorised implementing body, and without prejudice to ad hoc projects and programmes managed by the ACP Secretariat, the Commission shall be responsible for the implementation of intra-ACP operations.
3. Account being taken of the objectives and inherent characteristics of regional cooperation, operations undertaken in this sphere shall be governed by the procedures established for development finance cooperation where applicable.

CHAPTER 3
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Article 15
Project identification, preparation and appraisal
1. Projects and programmes that have been presented by the ACP State shall be subject to joint appraisal. The ACP-EC Development Finance Cooperation Committee shall develop the general guidelines and criteria for appraisal of projects and programmes.
2. Project or programme dossiers prepared and submitted for financing must contain all information necessary for the appraisal of the projects or programmes or, where such projects and programmes have not been completely defined, provide the broad outlines necessary for their appraisal. Such dossiers shall be officially transmitted to the Community by the ACP States or the other eligible beneficiaries in accordance with this Agreement.
3. Project and programme appraisal shall, take due account of national human resource constraints and ensure a strategy favourable to the promotion of such resources. It shall also take into account the specific characteristics and constraints of each ACP State.

Article 16
Financing proposal and decision
1. The conclusions of the appraisal shall be summarised in a financing proposal drawn up by the Community in close collaboration with the ACP State concerned. This financing proposal shall be submitted for approval by the Commission's decision-making body.
2. The financing proposal shall contain an advance timetable for the technical and financial implementation of the project or programme, including multi-annual programmes and global allocations for operations of a small financial scale, and shall deal with the duration of the different phases of implementation. The financing proposal shall:
(a) take into account the comments of the ACP State or States concerned; and
(b) be forwarded simultaneously to the ACP State or States concerned and the Community.
3. The Commission shall finalise the financing proposal and forward it, with or without amendment, to the Community's decision-making body. The ACP State or States concerned shall be given an opportunity to comment on any amendment of substance which the Commission intends to make to the document. These comments shall be reflected in the amended financing proposal.
4. The Community's decision-making body shall communicate its decision within 120 days from the date of communication of the financial proposal referred to above.
5. Where the financing proposal is not adopted by the Community, the ACP State or States concerned shall be informed immediately of the reasons for that decision. In such a case, the representatives of the ACP State or States concerned may, within 60 days thereafter, request either:
(a) that the matter be referred to the ACP-EC Development Finance Cooperation Committee set up under the Agreement; or
(b) that they be given a hearing by the Community's decision-making body.
6. Following such a hearing, a definitive decision to adopt or reject the financing proposal shall be taken by the relevant Community body to which the ACP State or States concerned may forward, before the decision is taken, any facts which may appear necessary to supplement the information available to it.
7. Multi-annual programmes shall, inter alia, finance training, decentralised operations, micro-projects, trade promotion and trade development, sets of operations of a limited scale in a specific sector, project/programme management support and technical cooperation.
8. In cases referred to above, the ACP State concerned may submit to the Head of Delegation a multi-annual programme setting out its broad outlines, the types of actions envisaged and the financial commitment proposed:
(a) the financing decision on each multi-annual programme shall be taken by the Chief Authorising Officer. The letter from the Chief Authorising Officer to the National Authorising Officer notifying such decision shall constitute the financing agreement; and
(b) within the framework of multi-annual programmes thus adopted, the National Authorising Officer or, when the case arises, the agent of decentralised cooperation which has been delegated functions for this purpose or, in appropriate cases, other eligible beneficiaries shall implement each individual action in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement and the terms of the financing agreement referred to above. Where implementation is to be carried out by agents of decentralised cooperation or other eligible beneficiaries, the National Authorising Officer and the Head of Delegation shall maintain financial responsibility and monitor the operations regularly with a view to enabling them, inter alia, to carry out their obligations.
9. At the end of each year, the National Authorising Officer in consultation with the Head of Delegation, shall forward a report to the Commission on the implementation of the multi-annual programmes.

Article 17
Financing agreement
1. Save as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, for any project or programme financed by a grant from the Fund, a financing agreement shall be drawn up between the Commission and the ACP State or States concerned. Where the direct beneficiary is not an ACP State, the Commission shall formalise the financing decision by means of an exchange of letters with the beneficiary concerned.
2. The financing agreement shall be drawn up between the Commission and the ACP State or States concerned within 60 days of the decision of the Community's decision-making body. The agreement shall:
(a) specify, in particular the details of the Fund's financial commitment and the financing arrangements and terms, the general and specific provisions relating to the project or programme concerned and shall also incorporate the advance timetable for the technical implementation of the project or programme contained in the financing proposal; and
(b) make adequate provision for appropriations to cover cost increases and contingencies.
3. Once the financing agreement has been signed, disbursements shall be made in accordance with the financing plan laid down therein. Any unexpended balance left upon closure of the accounts of projects and programmes shall accrue to the ACP State concerned and shall be so specified in the Fund's books. It may be used in the manner laid down in this Agreement for the financing of projects and programmes.

Article 18
Cost over-runs
1. Once it appears that cost over-runs beyond the limit set in the financing agreement are likely to be incurred, the National Authorising Officer shall, through the Head of Delegation, notify the Chief Authorising Officer accordingly, as well as of the measures which the National Authorising Officer intends to take in order to cover such cost over-runs over the allocated appropriations, either by reducing the scale of the project or programme or by calling on national or other non-Community resources.
2. If it is decided by agreement with the Community not to scale down the project or programme or if it is not possible to cover them by other resources, then such over-runs may be financed up to 20% of the financial commitment for the project or programme concerned from the indicative programme.

Article 19
Retroactive financing
1. In order to ensure early project start-up, avoid gaps between sequential projects and prevent delays, the ACP States, in agreement with the Commission, may, on completion of project appraisal and before the financing decision is taken:
(a) issue invitations to tender for all types of contracts, with a suspension clause; and
(b) pre-finance activities linked to the start-up of programmes, preliminary and seasonal work, orders for equipment with long delivery lead times as well as some on-going operations. Such expenditures must satisfy the procedures provided for in the Agreement.
2. These provisions do not prejudge the powers of the Community's decision-making body.
3. Expenditure made by the ACP State in pursuance of this provision shall be retroactively financed under the project or programme, once the financing agreement is signed.

CHAPTER 4

(b) If, during the application of this Annex, the ACP States request that new lines of agricultural production or agricultural products which are not the subject of specific arrangements when this Annex enters into force should benefit from such arrangements, the Community shall examine these requests in consultation with the ACP States.
(c) Notwithstanding the above, the Community shall, in the context of the special relations and special nature of ACP-EC cooperation, examine on a case-by-case basis the requests from the ACP States for preferential access for their agricultural products to the Community market and shall notify its decision on these reasoned requests if possible within four months, and in any case not more than six months after the date of their submission.

3. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall in no case constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction of trade generally.
In cases where implementation of the measures referred to in paragraph 2 affects the interests of one or more ACP States, consultation shall be held at the request of the latter, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of this Agreement, with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution.

Article 3
1.

Article 9
1. Prior consultation shall take place concerning the application of the safeguard clause, both when such measures are first adopted and when they are extended. The Community shall provide the ACP States with all the information required for such consultations and shall provide the data from which to determine to what extent imports from an ACP State of a specific product have caused the effects referred to in Article 8(1).
2. Where consultations have taken place, safeguard measures, or arrangements jointly agreed upon by the ACP States concerned and the Community, shall enter into force thereafter.

TITLE II
DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF "ORIGINATING PRODUCTS"
Article 2
General requirements
1. For the purpose of implementing the trade co-operation provisions of ANNEX V, the following products shall be considered as originating in the ACP States:
(a) products wholly obtained in the ACP States within the meaning of Article 3 of this Protocol;
(b) products obtained in the ACP States incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the ACP States within the meaning of Article 4 of this Protocol.
2. For the purpose of implementing paragraph 1, the territories of the ACP States shall be considered as being one territory.
Originating products made up of materials wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in two or more ACP States shall be considered as products originating in the ACP State where the last working or processing took place, provided the working or processing carried out there goes beyond that referred to in Article 5 of this Protocol.

Article 3
Wholly obtained products
1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained, in the ACP States or in the Community, or in the overseas countries and territories defined in Annex III, hereafter referred to as the OCT:
(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;
(b) vegetable products harvested there;
(c) live animals born and raised there;
(d) products from live animals raised there;
(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;
(f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters by their vessels;
(g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);
(h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;
(i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;
(j) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;
(k) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (j).
2. The terms "their vessels" and "their factory ships" in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:
(a) which are registered or recorded in an EC Member State, in an ACP State or in an OCT
(b) which sail under the flag of an EC Member State, of an ACP State or of an OCT;
(c) which are owned to an extent of at least 50 per cent by nationals of States party to the Agreement, or of an OCT, or by a company with its head office in one of these States or OCT, of which the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of States party to the Agreement, or of an OCT, and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States party to the Agreement or to public bodies or nationals of the said States, or of an OCT;
(d) of which at least 50 % of the crew, master and officers included, are nationals of States party to the Agreement, or of an OCT.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the Community shall recognise, upon request of an ACP State, that vessels chartered or leased by the ACP State be treated as "their vessels" to undertake fisheries activities in its exclusive economic zone under the following conditions:
- that the ACP State offered the Community the opportunity to negotiate a fisheries agreement and the Community did not accept this offer;
- that at least 50 % of the crew, master and officers included are nationals of States party to the Agreement, or of an OCT;
- that the charter or lease contract has been accepted by the ACP-EC Customs Cooperation Committee as providing adequate opportunities for developing the capacity of the ACP State to fish on its own account and in particular as conferring on the ACP State the responsibility for the nautical and commercial management of the vessel placed at its disposal for a significant period of time.

Article 4
Sufficiently worked or processed products
1. For the purposes of this Protocol, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed in the ACP States, or in the Community or in the OCT, when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.
The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, should not be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that:
(a) their total value does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the product;
(b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply except as provided in Article 5.

Article 5
Insufficient working or processing operations
1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 4 are satisfied:
(a) operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);
(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;
c) (i) changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of packages;
(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packaging operations;
(d) affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;
(e) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds, where one or more components of the mixtures do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating in an ACP State, in the Community or in the OCT;
(f) simple assembly of parts to constitute a complete product;
(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);
(h) slaughter of animals.
2. All the operations carried out in either the ACP States, the Community or the OCT on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.

Article 6
Cumulation of origin
Cumulation with the OCT and the Community
1. Materials originating in the Community or in the OCT shall be considered as materials originating in the ACP States when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 5.
2. Working and processing carried out in the Community or in the OCT shall be considered as having been carried out in the ACP States, when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in the ACP States.
Cumulation with South Africa
3. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, materials originating in South Africa shall be considered as originating in the ACP States when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing.
4. Products which have acquired originating status by virtue of paragraph 3 shall only continue to be considered as products originating in the ACP States when the value added there exceeds the value of the materials used originating in South Africa. If this is not so, the products concerned shall be considered as originating in South Africa. In the allocation of origin, no account shall be taken of materials originating in South Africa which have undergone sufficient working or processing in the ACP States.
5. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 3 may only be applied after 3 years for the products listed in Annex XI and 6 years for the products listed in Annex XII respectively, as from the provisional application of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Co-operation between the European Community and the Republic of South Africa. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 3 shall not be applicable to the products listed in Annex XIII.
6. Notwithstanding paragraph 5, the cumulation provided for in paragraph 3 may be applied at the request of the ACP States for the products listed in Annexes XI and XII. The ACP-EC Committee of Ambassadors shall decide on the ACP requests, product per product, on the basis of a report drawn up by the ACP-EC Customs Co-operation Committee in accordance with Article 37. In the examination of requests, account shall be taken of the risk of the circumvention of the trade provisions of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Co-operation between the European Community and the Republic of South Africa.
7. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 3 shall only be applicable to the products listed in Annex XIV when the tariffs on these products in the framework of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Co-operation between the European Community and the Republic of South Africa have been eliminated. The European Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities (C series) the date on which the conditions of this paragraph have been fulfilled.
8. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 3 may only be applied where the South African materials used have acquired the status of originating products by an application of the rules of origin identical to those set out in this Protocol. The ACP States shall provide the Community with details of agreements and their corresponding rules of origin which have been concluded with South Africa. The European Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities (C series) the date on which the ACP States have met the obligations laid down in this paragraph.
9. Without prejudice to paragraphs 5 and 7, working and processing carried out in South Africa shall be considered as having been carried out in an other Member State of the South African Customs Union (SACU) when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in that other Member State of SACU.
10. Without prejudice to paragraphs 5 and 7 and at the request of the ACP States, working and processing carried out in South Africa, shall be considered as having been carried out in the ACP States, when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in an ACP State within the context of a regional economic integration agreement.
Unless there is a specific request by either party for a referral of the decision to the ACP-EC Council of Ministers, the ACP-EC Customs Cooperation Committee shall decide on the ACP requests in accordance with Article 37.
Cumulation with neighbouring developing countries
11. At the request of the ACP States, materials originating in a neighbouring developing country, other than an ACP State, belonging to a coherent geographical entity, shall be considered as materials originating in the ACP States when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided that:
- the working or processing carried out in the ACP State exceeds the operations listed in Article 5. However, products of Chapter 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System shall in addition undergo in the ACP State at least working or processing as a result of which the product obtained is classified in a heading which is different from those in which the materials originating in the non-ACP developing country used in its manufacture, are classified. For products listed in Annex IX to this Protocol, only the specific processing referred to in column 3 shall apply, whether or not it involves a change of heading,
- the ACP States, the Community and the other countries concerned have concluded an agreement on adequate administrative procedures which will ensure correct implementation of this paragraph.
This paragraph shall not apply to tuna products classified under Harmonised System Chapters 3 or 16, rice products of HS Code 1006 or the textile products listed in Annex X to this Protocol.
For the purpose of determining whether the products originate in the non-ACP developing country, the provisions of this Protocol shall apply.
Unless there is a specific request by either party for a referral of the decision to the ACP-EC Council of Ministers, the ACP-EC Customs Cooperation Committee shall decide on the ACP requests in accordance with Article 37.

Article 7
Unit of qualification
1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.
Accordingly, it follows that:
- when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonized System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;
- when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.
2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.

Article 8
Accessories, spare parts and tools
Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.

Article 9
Sets
Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.

Article 10
Neutral elements
In order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:
(a) energy and fuel;
(b) plant and equipment;
(c) machines and tools;
(d) goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.

However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, transshipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.
Originating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of an ACP State, of the Community or of an OCT.
2. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:

(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.

Article 13
Exhibitions
1. Originating products, sent from an ACP State for exhibition in a country other than those referred to in Article 6 and sold after the exhibition for importation into the Community shall benefit on importation from the provisions of Annex V provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:
(a) an exporter has consigned these products from an ACP State to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;
(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the Community;
(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and

Discrepancies and formal errors
1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.
2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.

When carrying out this review, the Community shall ensure that there will be no decrease in the amounts to be used in any national currency and shall furthermore consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.
3. When the products are invoiced in the currency of another EC Member State, the importing country shall recognize the amount notified by the Member State concerned.

TITLE V
ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION
Article 31
Mutual assistance
1. The ACP States shall send to the Commission specimens of the stamps used together with the addresses of the customs authorities competent to issue movement certificates EUR.1 and carry out the subsequent verification of movement certificates EUR.1 and invoice declarations.
Movement certificates EUR.1 and invoice declarations shall be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment from the date the information is received by the Commission.
The Commission shall send this information to the customs authorities of the Member States.
2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Community, the OCT, the ACP States shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1, the invoice declarations or supplier's declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.
The authorities consulted shall furnish the relevant information concerning the conditions under which the product has been made, indicating especially the conditions in which the rules of origin have been respected in the various ACP States, Member States, OCT concerned.

Article 32
Verification of proofs of origin
1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing country have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.
2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof or origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.
3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting country. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.
4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.
5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the ACP States or in one of the countries referred to in Article 6 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.
6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.
7. Where the verification procedure or any other available information appears to indicate that the provisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the ACP State on its own initiative or at the request of the Community shall carry out appropriate enquires or arrange for such enquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions and for this purpose the ACP State concerned may invite the participation of the Community in these enquiries.

Article 33
Verification of suppliers' declarations
1. Verification of suppliers' declaration may be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of the document or the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the true origin of the materials in question.
2. The customs authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made to issue an information certificate, a specimen of which appears in Annex VII to this Protocol. Alternatively, the customs authorities to which a supplier's declaration is submitted may request the exporter to produce an information certificate issued by the customs authorities of the State where the declaration was made.
A copy of the information certificate shall be preserved by the office which has issued it for at least three years.
3. The requesting customs authorities shall be informed of the results of the verification as soon as possible. The results must be such as to indicate positively whether the declaration concerning the status of the materials is correct.
4. For the purpose of verification, suppliers shall keep for not less than three years a copy of the document containing the declaration together with all necessary evidence showing the true status of the materials.
5. The customs authorities in the State where the supplier's declaration is established shall have the right to call for any evidence or to carry out any check which they consider appropriate in order to verify the correctness of any supplier's declaration.
6. Any movement certificate EUR.1 or invoice declaration issued or made out on the basis of an incorrect supplier's declaration shall be considered null and void.

Article 34
Dispute settlement
Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Articles 32 and 33 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Customs Cooperation Committee.
In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing country shall be under the legislation of the said country.

Article 35
Penalties
Penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.

Article 36
Free zones
1. The ACP States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin or a supplier's declaration and which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.
2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when originating products are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.

Article 37
Customs Cooperation Committee
1. A Customs Cooperation Committee, hereinafter referred to as "the Committee", shall be set up and charged with carrying out administrative cooperation with a view to the correct and uniform application of this Protocol and with carrying out any other task in the customs field which may be entrusted to it.
2. The Committee shall examine regularly the effect on the ACP States and in particular on the least developed ACP States of application of the rules of origin and shall recommend to the Council of Ministers appropriate measures.
3. The Committee shall take decisions on cumulation under the conditions laid down in Article 6.
4. The Committee shall take decisions on derogations from this Protocol, under the conditions laid down in Article 38.
5. The Committee shall meet regularly, in particular to prepare the decisions of the Council of Ministers pursuant to Article 40.
6. The Committee shall be composed on the one hand of experts from the Member States and of Commission officials responsible for customs questions, and on the other hand of experts representing the ACP States and of officials of regional groupings of the ACP States who are responsible for customs questions. The Committee may call upon appropriate expertise where necessary.

Article 38
Derogations
1. Derogations from this Protocol may be adopted by the Committee where the development of existing industries or the creation of new industries justifies them.
The ACP State or States concerned shall, either before or when the ACP States submit the matter to the Committee, notify the Community of its request for a derogation together with the reasons for the request in accordance with paragraph 2.
The Community shall respond positively to all the ACP requests which are duly justified in conformity with this Article and which cannot cause serious injury to an established Community industry.
2. In order to facilitate the examination by the Committee of requests for derogation, the ACP State making the request shall, by means of the form given in Annex VIII to this Protocol, furnish in support of its request the fullest possible information covering in particular the points listed below:
- description of the finished product,
- nature and quantity of materials originating in a third country,
- nature and quantity of materials originating in ACP States, the Community or the OCT, or which have been processed there,
- manufacturing processes,
- value added,
- number of employees in the enterprise concerned,
- anticipated volume of exports to the Community,
- other possible sources of supply for raw materials
- reasons for the duration requested in the light of efforts made to find new sources of supply,
- other observations.
The same rules shall apply to any requests for extension.
The Committee may modify the form.
3. The examination of requests shall in particular take into account:
(a) the level of development or the geographical situation of the ACP State or States concerned;
(b) cases where the application of the existing rules of origin would significantly affect the ability of an existing industry in an ACP State to continue its exports to the Community, with particular reference to cases where this could lead to cessation of its activities;
(c) specific cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that significant investment in an industry could be deterred by the rules of origin and where a derogation favouring the realisation of the investment programme would enable these rules to be satisfied by stages.
4. In every case an examination shall be made to ascertain whether the rules relating to cumulation of origin do not provide a solution to the problem.
5. In addition when a request for derogation concerns a least-developed or an island ACP State, its examination shall be carried out with a favourable bias having particular regard to:
(a) the economic and social impact of the decision to be taken especially in respect of employment;
(b) the need to apply the derogation for a period taking into account the particular situation of the ACP State concerned and its difficulties.
6. In the examination of requests, special account shall be taken, case by case, of the possibility of conferring originating status on products which include in their composition materials originating in neighbouring developing countries, least-developed countries or developing countries with which one or more ACP States have special relations, provided that satisfactory administrative co-operation can be established.
7. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 6, the derogation shall be granted where the value added to the non-originating products used in the ACP State or States concerned is at least 45 % of the value of the finished product, provided that the derogation is not such as to cause serious injury to an economic sector of the Community or of one or more Member States.
8. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 to 7, derogations concerning canned tuna and tuna loins shall only be granted within an annual quota of 8000 tonnes for canned tuna and within an annual quota of 2000 tonnes for tuna loins.
Applications for such derogations shall be submitted by the ACP States in accordance with the abovementioned quota to the Committee, which shall grant them automatically and put them into force by means of a decision.
9. The Committee shall take steps necessary to ensure that a decision is reached as quickly as possible and in any case not later than seventy-five working days after the request is received by the EC Co-chairman of the Committee. If the Community does not inform the ACP States of its position on the request within this period, the request shall be deemed to have been accepted. In the event of a decision not being taken by the Committee, the Committee of Ambassadors shall be called upon to decide within one month of the date on which the matter is referred to it.
10. (a) The derogation shall be valid for a period, generally of five years, to be determined by the Committee.
(b) The derogation decision may provide for renewals without a new decision of the Committee being necessary, provided that the ACP State or States concerned submit, three months before the end of each period, proof that they are still unable to meet the conditions of this Protocol which have been derogated from.
If any objection is made to the extension, the Committee shall examine it as soon as possible and decide whether to prolong the derogation. The Committee shall proceed as provided for in paragraph 9. All necessary measures shall be taken to avoid interruptions in the application of the derogation.
(c) In the periods referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b), the Committee may review the terms for implementing the derogation should a significant change be found to have taken place in the substantive factors governing the decision to grant the derogation. On conclusion of its review the Committee may decide to amend the terms of its decision as regards the scope of derogation or any other condition previously laid down.

Annex I to Protocol 1

INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX II
Note 1:
The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 4 of the Protocol.
Note 2:
1. first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rules in columns 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.
2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.
3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4.
4. Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.
Note 3:
1. The provisions of Article 4 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in the ACP States.
Example:
An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from "other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging" of heading No ex 7224.
If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.
2. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus if a rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.
3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that "materials of any heading" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression "manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No ..." means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.
4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.
Example:
The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.
5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.3 below in relation to textiles).
Example:
The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.
However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.
Example:
In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.
6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.
Note 4:
1. The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.
2. The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.
3. The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.
4. The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.
Note 5:
1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials, used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 per cent or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).
2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.
The following are the basic textile materials:
- silk,
- wool,
- coarse animal hair,
- fine animal hair,
- horsehair,
- cotton,
- paper-making materials and paper,
- flax,
- true hemp,
- jute and other textile bast fibres,
- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,
- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,
- synthetic man-made filaments,
- artificial man-made filaments,
- current conducting filaments,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide,
- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride,
- other synthetic man-made staple fibres,
- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,
- other artificial man-made staple fibres,
- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped,
- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped,
- products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,
- other products of heading No 5605.
Example:
A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.
Example:
A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used provided their total weight does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the fabric.
Example:
Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.
Example:
If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.
3. In the case of products incorporating "yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped" this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn.
4. In the case of products incorporating "strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two layers of plastic film", this tolerance is 30 per cent in respect of this strip.
Note 6:
1. In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.
Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63. Linings and interlinings are not be regarded as trimmings or accessories.
2. Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5.
3. In accordance with Note 3.5, any non-originating non-textile trimmings and accessories or other product, which do not contain any textiles, may, anyway, be used freely where they cannot be made from the materials listed in column 3.
- For example(1), if a rule in the list says that for a particular textile item, such as a blouse, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because they cannot be made from textile materials.
4. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.
Note 7:
1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the "specific processes" are the following:
(a) vacuum distillation;
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(2);
(c) cracking;
(d) reforming;
(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;
(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;
(g) polymerization;
(h) alkylation;
(i) isomerization.
2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the "specific processes" are the following:
(a) vacuum distillation;
(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(3)
(c) cracking;
(d) reforming;
(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;
(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;

(l) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorization) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;
(m) in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 per cent of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C by the ASTM D 86 method;
(n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.
3. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.

It is possible that in particular manufacturing operations, the accomplishment of finishing operations, especially in the case of a combination of operations, is of such importance that these operations must be considered as going beyond simple finishing. In these particular cases, the non-accomplishing of finishing operations will deprive the making-up of its complete nature.

>TABLE>


PROTOCOL 2
on the implementation of Article 9

1. The Parties agree that every endeavour should be made to avoid recourse being had to the safeguard measures provided for under Article 8.
2. Both Parties are guided by the conviction that the implementation of Article 9 (4) and (5) would enable them to recognize, at an early stage, problems which could arise and, taking account of all relevant factors, avoid as far as possible recourse to measures which the Community would prefer not to adopt vis-à-vis its preferential trading partners.
3. Both Parties acknowledge the need for implementation of the mechanism of advance information provided for under Article 9 (4), the objective of which is to limit, in the case of sensitive products, the risks of sudden or unforeseen recourse to safeguard measures. These arrangements will permit the maintenance of a regular flow of trade information and the simultaneous implementation of regular consultation procedures. Thus the two Parties will be in a position to follow closely the trends in the sensitive sectors and detect problems which could arise.
4. The following two procedures result from this:
(a) The statistical surveillance mechanism
Without prejudice to internal arrangements that the Community may apply to control its imports, Article 9 (4) provides for the institution of a mechanism intended to ensure statistical surveillance of certain ACP exports to the Community and thus facilitate the examination of occurrences such as to cause market disturbances.
This mechanism, the sole objective of which is to facilitate the exchange of information between the parties, should apply only to products, which the Community considers, insofar as it is concerned, as sensitive.
The implementation of this mechanism will be the subject of a joint agreement on the basis of data to be furnished by the Community and with the help of statistical information to be communicated by the ACP States to the Commission at the latter's request.
For the effective implementation of this mechanism it is necessary that the ACP States concerned provide the Commission, as far as possible on a monthly basis, with statistics relating to their exports to the Community and to each of its Member States of products considered by the Community to be sensitive.
(b) A procedure for regular consultation
The statistical surveillance mechanism mentioned above will enable the two Parties better to follow the trends in trade likely to cause concern. On the basis of this information and in accordance with Article 9(5), the Community and the ACP States will have the possibility of holding periodic consultations in order to ensure that the objectives of that Article are fulfilled. These consultations will take place at the request of either Party.
5. If the conditions of application of safeguard measures as provided for in Article 8 are fulfilled, it would be the responsibility of the Community, in accordance with Article 9(1) relating to prior consultations concerning the application of safeguard measures, to enter immediately into consultations with the ACP States concerned by providing them with all the information necessary for those consultations, especially the necessary data from which to determine to what extent imports of a specific product from an ACP State or States have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to the Community's domestic producers of like or directly competitive products or serious disturbances in a sector of the economy of the Community or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region of the Community.
6. If no other arrangement has been concluded in the meanwhile with the ACP State or States concerned, the competent authorities of the Community may, at the end of the twenty-one day period provided for in respect of those consultations, take the appropriate measures for the implementation of Article 8. These measures shall be communicated immediately to the ACP States and become immediately applicable.
7. This procedure would apply without prejudice to measures, which could be taken in the event of special factors within the meaning of Article 9(3). In this case all relevant information will be supplied promptly to the ACP States.
8. In this case, the interests of the least developed, landlocked and island ACP States will receive particular attention, in accordance with Article 2 of the Agreement.

Article 6
Purchase at the guaranteed price, referred to in Article 5 (3), shall be assured through the medium of the intervention agencies or of other agents appointed by the Community.

Article 7
1. If, during any delivery period, a sugar-exporting ACP State fails to deliver its agreed quantity in full for reasons of force majeure the Commission shall, at the request of the State concerned, allow the necessary additional period for delivery.
2. If a sugar-exporting ACP State informs the Commission during the course of a delivery period that it will be unable to deliver its agreed quantity in full and that it does not wish to have the additional period referred to in paragraph 1, the shortfall shall be reallocated by the Commission for delivery during the delivery period in question. Such reallocation shall be made by the Commission after consultation with the States concerned.
3. If, during any delivery period, a sugar-exporting ACP State fails to deliver its agreed quantity in full for reasons other than force majeure, that quantity shall be reduced in respect of each subsequent delivery period by the undelivered quantity.
4. It may be decided by the Commission that, in respect of subsequent delivery periods, the undelivered quantity shall be reallocated between the other States, which are referred to in Article 3. Such reallocation shall be made in consultation with the States concerned.

Article 8
1. At the request of one or more of the States supplying sugar under the terms of this Protocol, or of the Community, consultations relating to all measures necessary for the application of this Protocol shall take place within an appropriate institutional framework to be adopted by the Contracting Parties.

DECLARATION I
Joint Declaration on the actors of the partnership (Article 6)
The Parties agree that the definition of civil society may differ significantly according to the socio-economic and cultural conditions of each ACP country. However, they believe that this definition may include inter alia the following organisations: human rights groups and agencies, grassroots organisations, women's associations, youth organisations, child-protection organisations, environmental movements, farmers' organisations, consumers' associations, religious organisations, development support structures (NGOs, teaching and research establishments), cultural associations and the media.
DECLARATION II
Declaration of the Commission and the Council of the European Union on the clause concerning the return and readmission of illegal immigrants [Article 13(5)]
Article 13(5) shall be without prejudice to the internal division of powers between the Community and its Member States for the conclusion of readmission agreements.
DECLARATION III
Joint Declaration on participation in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly [Article 17(1)]
The Parties reaffirm the role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in promoting and defending democratic processes through dialogue between members of parliament, and agree that the participation of representatives who are not members of a parliament, as set out in Article 17, shall be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. Such participation shall be subject to the approval of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly before each session.
DECLARATION IV
Community Declaration on the financing of the ACP Secretariat
The Community shall contribute to the cost of running the ACP Secretariat from intra-ACP cooperation resources.
DECLARATION V
Community Declaration on the financing of the joint institutions
The Community, being aware that expenditure in connection with interpreting at meetings and the translation of documents is expenditure incurred essentially for its own requirements, is prepared to continue past practice and meet this expenditure both for meetings of the institutions of the Agreement which take place in the territory of a Member State and those which take place in the territory of an ACP State.
DECLARATION VI
Community Declaration relating to the Protocol on privileges and immunities
The Protocol on privileges and immunities is a multilateral act from the point of view of international law. However, any specific problems that may arise in the host State regarding the application of this Protocol should be settled by bilateral agreement with that State.
The Community has noted the ACP States' requests that certain provisions of Protocol 2 be modified, notably as regards the status of the staff of the ACP Secretariat, the Centre for the Development of Enterprise (CDE) and the Centre for the Development of Agriculture (CTA).
The Community is willing to seek jointly appropriate solutions in respect of the ACP States' requests with a view to establishing a separate legal instrument as referred to above.
In this context, the host country will, without derogating from the present benefits enjoyed by the ACP Secretariat, the CDE, the CTA and their staff:
(1) Show understanding as regards the interpretation of the expression "staff of senior rank", such an interpretation to be arrived at by mutual agreement;
(2) Recognise the powers delegated by the President of the Council of ACP Ministers to the Chairman of the ACP-EC Committee of Ambassadors, in order to simplify implementation of Article 9 of the Protocol;
(3) Agree to grant certain facilities to the staff of the ACP Secretariat, the CDE and the CTA to facilitate initial installation in the host country;
(4) Examine in an appropriate way tax-related questions concerning the ACP Secretariat, the CDE and the CTA and their staff.
DECLARATION VII
Declaration by the Member States relating to the Protocol on privileges and immunities
The Member States shall strive, in the context of their respective regulations, to facilitate throughout their respective territories, the movement in pursuit of their official duties of ACP diplomats accredited to the Community, members of the ACP Secretariat referred to in Article 7 of Protocol 2, whose names and positions shall be communicated in accordance with Article 9 of that Protocol, and the ACP executives of the CDE and the CTA.
DECLARATION VIII
Joint Declaration relating to the Protocol on privileges and immunities
Within the context of their respective regulations, the ACP States shall grant Commission delegations privileges and immunities similar to those granted to diplomatic missions so that they are able to carry out the functions incumbent on them under the Agreement in a satisfactory and effective manner.
DECLARATION IX
Joint Declaration on Article 49(2) on trade and environment
Keenly aware of the specific risks attaching to radioactive waste, the Parties will refrain from any practice of discharging such waste which would encroach upon the sovereignty of States or threaten the environment or public health in other countries. They attach the greatest importance to developing international cooperation to protect the environment and public health against such risks. They accordingly affirm their determination to play an active part in the work being done in the IAEA to produce an internationally approved code of good practice.
Council Directive 92/3/Euratom of 3 February 1992 on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste between Member States and into and out of the Community defines the term "radioactive waste" as any material, which contains or is contaminated by radio-nuclides and for which no use is foreseen. The Directive is applicable to shipments of radioactive waste between Member States and into and out of the Community whenever the quantities and concentration exceed the levels laid down in Article 3(2)(a) and (b) of the Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996. The defined levels ensure basic safety standards for the protection of health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.
Shipments of radioactive waste are subject to a system of prior authorisation as defined in Directive 92/3/Euratom of 3 February 1992 on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste between Member States and into and out of the Community. Article 11(1)b of the Directive stipulates that the competent authorities of Member States shall not authorise shipments of radioactive waste to a State party to the Fourth ACP-EEC Convention which is not a member of the Community, taking account, however, of Article 14. The Community ensures that Article 11 of Directive 92/3/Euratom will be revised to cover all Parties of this Agreement which are not members of the Community. Until then, the Community will act, as if the abovementioned parties would already be covered.
The Parties shall make every effort to sign and ratify as quickly as possible the Basle Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, as well as the 1995 amendment to the Convention, as laid down in Decision III/1.
DECLARATION X
ACP Declaration on trade and environment
The ACP States are seriously concerned about environmental problems in general and the transboundary movement of hazardous, nuclear and other radioactive wastes in particular.
In interpreting and implementing the provisions of Article 32(1)(d) of the Agreement, the ACP States have expressed their determination to be guided by the principles and the provisions of the OAU Resolution on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal in Africa as contained in AHG 182 (XXV).
DECLARATION XI
Joint Declaration on the ACP cultural heritage
1. The Parties express their common will to promote the preservation and enhancement of the cultural heritage of each ACP country, at the international, bilateral and private level and in the context of this Agreement.
2. The Parties acknowledge the need to facilitate the access of ACP historians and researchers to archives with a view to promoting the development of exchange of information on the cultural heritage of ACP States.
3. They acknowledge the usefulness of providing assistance for the appropriate activities conducted especially in the area of training, for the preservation, protection and exhibition of cultural properties, monuments and objects, including the promulgation and implementation of appropriate legislation.
4. They underpin the importance of undertaking common cultural activities, facilitating the mobility of ACP and European artists, as well as the exchanges of cultural objects which are symbolic of their cultures and civilisations with a view to enhancing mutual understanding and solidarity between their respective populations.
DECLARATION XII
Declaration by the ACP States on return or restitution of cultural property
The ACP States urge the Community and its Member States, insofar as they acknowledge the legitimate right of the ACP States to cultural identity, to promote the return or restitution of cultural property taken from ACP States and now to be found in Member States.
DECLARATION XIII
Joint Declaration on copyright
The Parties acknowledge that promotion of copyright protection is an integral part of cultural cooperation, the aim of which is to enhance all forms of human expression. Furthermore, such protection is a prerequisite for nurturing and developing production, dissemination and publishing activities.
Consequently, the two Parties shall, in the context of ACP-EC cultural cooperation, seek to promote and foster respect for copyright and related rights.
In this context, and in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down by the Agreement, the Community may offer financial and technical support for disseminating copyright information, training economic operators in the protection of such rights and drafting national legislation for their better protection.
DECLARATION XIV
Joint Declaration on regional cooperation and the outermost regions (Article 28)
The reference to the outermost regions concerns the Spanish autonomous community of the Canary Islands, the four French overseas departments, namely Guadeloupe, Guyana, Martinique and Réunion, and the Portuguese autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira.
DECLARATION XV
Joint Declaration on accession
Any accession of a third State to this Agreement shall be made in compliance with the provisions of Article 1 and the objectives of Article 2 laid down by the ACP Group in the Georgetown Agreement as amended in November 1992.
DECLARATION XVI
Joint Declaration on accession of the overseas countries and territories referred to in Part Four of the EC Treaty
The Community and the ACP States are prepared to allow the overseas countries and territories referred to in Part Four of the Treaty which have become independent to accede to this Agreement, if they wish to continue their relations with the Community in this form.
DECLARATION XVII
Joint Declaration on Article 66 (debt relief) of the Agreement
The Parties agree on the following principles:
(a) In the longer-term, the Parties will seek an improvement of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative and promote a deepening, broadening and speeding up debt relief to ACP Countries;
(b) The Parties will also seek the mobilisation and establishment of support mechanisms for debt reduction in favour of ACP countries who are not yet eligible for the HIPC initiative.
DECLARATION XVIII
EU Declaration on the Financial Protocol
Within the overall amount of EUR 13500 million of the 9th EDF, EUR 12500 million shall be made available immediately upon the entry into force of the Financial Protocol. The remaining EUR 1000 million shall be released on the basis of the performance review referred to in paragraph 7 of the Financial Protocol that shall be undertaken in 2004.
In evaluating the need for new resources, full account shall be taken of this performance review as well as of a date beyond which the funds of the 9th EDF will not be committed.
DECLARATION XIX
Declaration by the Council and the Commission on the Programming Process
The Community and its Member States reaffirm their attachment to the agreement on a reform of the programming process for implementation of assistance financed from the 9th EDF.
In this context, the Community and its Member States regard a properly implemented review mechanism as the most important tool for successful programming. The review process that has been agreed for governing the implementation of the 9th EDF will ensure continuity in the programming process while allowing for regular adjustments of the Country Support Strategy to reflect developments in needs and performance of the ACP State concerned.
In order to reap the full benefits of the reform and ensure the efficiency of the programming process, the Community and its Member States reaffirm the political commitment to the following principles:
The reviews must as far as possible be carried out in the ACP State concerned. Localising the reviews shall not imply that the Member States or the Commission Headquarters shall be prevented from following and being involved in the programming process as appropriate.
The time frames that have been set for completion of the reviews shall be respected.
The reviews must not be an isolated event in the programming process. The reviews shall be regarded as management tools, which synthesise the results of the regular (monthly) dialogue between the National Authorising Officer and the Commission's Head of Delegation.
The reviews must not increase the administrative burden of either of the Parties concerned. The procedures and reporting requirements surrounding the programming process must therefore be managed in a disciplined manner. To this end, the respective roles of the Member States and the Commission in the decision making process will be reviewed and adapted.
DECLARATION XX
Joint Declaration on the Impact of Export Revenue Fluctuations on Vulnerable Small, Island and Landlocked ACP States
The Parties note the concern of ACP States that the modalities of the mechanism for additional support to countries suffering from fluctuation of export revenues may not provide sufficient support to vulnerable small, island and landlocked States subject to volatile export revenues.
From the second year of operation of the mechanism, and on request of one or more ACP States who have met with difficulties, the Parties agree to re-examine the modalities of the mechanism on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, with a view, where necessary, to remedy the effects of such fluctuations.
DECLARATION XXI
Community Declaration on Article 3 of Annex IV
The notification of the indicative amount referred to in Article 3 of Annex IV, will not apply to the ACP States with whom the Community has suspended its cooperation.
DECLARATION XXII
Joint declaration concerning agricultural products referred to in article 1(2)(a) of annex V
The Parties have taken note that the Community intends to take the measures mentioned in the Annex, and which are laid down at the date of signing of the Agreement, with a view to granting ACP States the preferential treatment provided for in Article 1(2)(a), for certain agricultural and processed products.
They have taken note that the Community declares that it will take all the measures required to ensure that the corresponding agricultural regulations are adopted in good time and that, wherever possible, they come into force at the same time as the interim arrangements which will be introduced after the signing of the successor Agreement to the Fourth ACP-EC Convention signed in Lomé on 15 December 1989.
Preferential treatment applicable to agricultural products and foodstuffs originating in the ACP States
>TABLE>
DECLARATION XXIII
Joint Declaration on market access in the ACP-EC Partnership
The Parties accept the fact that both sides expect to take part in the negotiations and implementation of agreements leading to further multilateral and bilateral trade liberalisation.
The Parties note the Community's commitment to provide least developed countries with free market access for essentially all products by 2005.
At the same time they recognise, with respect to ACP preferential access to the Community market, that this wider process of liberalisation could lead to a deterioration in the relative competitive position of the ACP States which would threaten their development efforts, which the Community is concerned to support.
The Parties therefore agree to examine all necessary measures in order to maintain the competitive position of the ACP States on the Community market during the preparatory period. This examination may include, inter alia, calendar requirements, rules of origin, sanitary and phytosanitary measures and implementation of specific measures addressing supply side constraints in the ACP countries. The objective will be to offer ACP countries possibilities to exploit their existing and potential comparative advantage on the Community market. Bearing in mind their commitment to cooperation in the WTO, the Parties agree that this examination will also take into account any extension within the WTO of the trade advantages which may be offered by member countries to developing countries. To this end, the Joint Ministerial Trade Committee should make recommendations on the basis of an initial review to be prepared by the Commission and the ACP Secretariat. The EC Council will examine these recommendations on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, with a view to preserving the benefits of the ACP-EC trade arrangement.
The Council of the European Union, for its part, underlines its obligation to take into account the effect of any agreement or other measures to be taken by the EC on ACP-EC trade. It requests the Commission to carry out the necessary impact assessments on a systematic basis.
The measures will relate to the preparatory period and will take due account of the Community's common agricultural policy.
The Joint Ministerial Trade Committee shall monitor the implementation of this Declaration and make appropriate reports to the Council of Ministers.
DECLARATION XXIV
Joint Declaration on rice
1. The Parties recognise the importance of rice for the economic development of a number of ACP countries in terms of employment, foreign exchange and social and political stability.
2. They further recognise the importance of the Community market for rice. The Community reaffirms its commitment to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the ACP rice sector in order to maintain a viable and sustainable industry and thereby contribute to the smooth integration of ACP countries into the world economy.
3. The Community is prepared to provide sufficient funds to finance during the preparatory period, in consultation with the ACP sector concerned, an integrated sector-specific programme for the development of ACP exporters of rice which could in particular include the following measures:
- improvement of conditions of production and enhancement of quality through action in the areas of research, harvesting and handling;
- transport and storage;
- enhancing the competitiveness of existing exporters of rice;
- assisting ACP rice producers to meet environmental and waste management standards and other norms in the international markets, including the Community;
- marketing and trade promotion;
- programmes designed to develop value added by-products.
This package of measures will be financed in ACP rice exporting nations on a national basis, by agreement of both Parties, through specific sectoral programmes in accordance with programming rules and methods and in the short term through unallocated EDF resources after a decision of the Council of Ministers.
4. The Parties reiterate their commitment to cooperate closely in order to ensure that the ACP States can benefit fully from the Community trade preferences for rice. They agree on the importance of effective and transparent implementation of all rice exports to the Community of ACP origin.
5. The Community will examine after the entry into force of the agreement the position of the ACP rice sector in the light of future changes occurring on the Community's rice market. To this end, the Parties agree to create with the ACP and representatives of the sector concerned, a joint working party, which shall meet annually. The Community further undertakes to consult the ACP States on any bilateral or multilateral decisions which may have an impact on the competitive position of the ACP rice industry in the Community market.
DECLARATION XXV
Joint Declaration on rum
The Parties recognise the importance of the rum sector for the economic and social development of several ACP countries and regions and its major contribution in providing employment, export earnings and Government revenues. They acknowledge that rum is a value added agro-industrial ACP product capable, if appropriate efforts are undertaken, of competing in a global economy. They therefore acknowledge the need to take all measures that might be necessary to overcome the competitive disadvantage, which ACP producers are presently facing. In this context they also note the undertaking contained in the Council and Commission Declaration of 24 March 1997 to fully take into account in any future negotiations and arrangements related to the rum sector, the impact of the EC-US agreement to eliminate the duty on certain spirituous beverages of the same date. They also recognise the urgent need for ACP producers to become less dependent on the commodity rum market.
The Parties therefore agree on the need for the rapid development of the ACP rum industry so as to allow exporters of ACP rum to compete on the Community and the international spirits markets. To this end, they agree to implement the following measures:
(1) Rum, arak and tafia originating in the ACP countries or regions falling under HS Code 22 08 40 shall be imported under this Agreement and any successor agreement to this Agreement, duty free and without quantitative limitations.
(2) The Community undertakes to ensure fair competition in the Community market and that ACP rum is not disadvantaged or discriminated against in the EU market, in relation to third country rum producers.
(3) The Community will, when considering any request for derogation to the provisions of Article 1.4(1) and (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1576/1989 of 29 March 1989 consult with and take account of the particular interests of ACP countries.
(4) The Community is prepared to provide sufficient funds to finance during the preparatory period, in consultation with the ACP sector concerned, an integrated sector-specific programme for the development of ACP exporters of rum, which could in particular include the following measures:
- enhancing the competitiveness of existing exporters of rum;
- assist in creation of rum marques or brands by ACP region or country;
- enabling marketing campaigns to be designed and implemented;
- assist ACP rum producers to meet environmental and waste management standards and other norms in the international markets including the Community market;
- assist the ACP rum industry to move out of bulk commodity production into higher value branded rum products.
This package of measures will be financed on a national and regional basis, by agreement of both parties, through specific sectoral programmes in accordance with programming rules and methods and, in the short term, through unallocated EDF resources after a decision of the Council of Ministers.
(5) The Community commits itself to examine the impact on the ACP industry of the indexation of the price point incorporated in the Memorandum of Understanding on rum in the agreement on white spirits of March 1997 at which duties on non-ACP rum are applied. In this light it will take, where necessary, appropriate measures.
(6) The Community undertakes to conduct appropriate consultations with the ACP through a joint working party, which shall meet regularly, on specific issues arising from these undertakings. The Community further undertakes to consult the ACP States on any bilateral or multilateral decisions, including tariff reductions and the enlargement of the Community, which may impact on the competitive position of the ACP rum industry in the Community market.
DECLARATION XXVI
Joint Declaration on beef and veal
1. The Community undertakes to ensure that the ACP States, beneficiaries of the Protocol on beef and veal, derive full benefits therefrom. To this end, it commits itself to give effect to the provisions of this protocol by enacting in a timely fashion appropriate rules and procedures.
2. The Community further undertakes to implement the protocol so that ACP States can market their beef and veal throughout the year without undue restrictions. In addition, the EC will assist the ACP beef and veal exporters to improve their competitiveness through, inter alia, addressing supply-side constraints, in accordance with the development strategies set out in this Agreement and within the context of National and Regional Indicative Programmes.
3. The Community will examine the requests of ACP Least-Developed-Countries to export their beef and veal under preferential conditions in the context of the actions it intends to take under the WTO's Integrated Framework for Least-Developed-Countries.
DECLARATION XXVII
Joint Declaration on the arrangements governing access to the markets of the French overseas departments for products originating in the ACP States referred to in Article 1(2) of Annex V
The Parties reaffirm that the provisions of Annex V apply to the relations between the French overseas departments and the ACP States.
The Community shall have the right during the life of the Agreement to amend, in the light of the economic development requirements of the French overseas departments, the arrangements governing access to the latter's markets for products originating in the ACP States referred to in Article 1(2) of Annex V.
When examining the possible application of this right, the Community will take into consideration the direct trade between the ACP States and the French overseas departments. Information and consultation procedures shall apply between the parties concerned in accordance with Article 12 of Annex V.
DECLARATION XXVIII
Joint Declaration on cooperation between ACP States and the neighbouring overseas countries and territories and French overseas departments
The Parties shall encourage greater regional cooperation in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean involving ACP States and the neighbouring overseas countries and territories and French overseas departments.
The Parties call upon interested Parties to consult each other on the procedure for promoting such cooperation and, in this context, to take measures, in line with their respective policies and their specific situation in the region, which will permit initiatives in the economic field, including the development of trade, as well as in the social and cultural fields.
Where there are trade agreements involving French overseas departments, such agreements may provide for specific measures in favour of products from those departments.
Issues relating to cooperation in these different areas shall be brought to the attention of the Council of Ministers, so that it can be duly informed of the progress achieved.
DECLARATION XXIX
Joint Declaration on products covered by the common agricultural policy
The Parties recognise that products covered by the common agricultural policy follow specific rules and regulations, in particular with regard to safeguard measures. The provisions of the Agreement concerning the safeguard clause may be applied to these products only insofar as they are consistent with the specific nature of these rules and regulations.
DECLARATION XXX
ACP Declaration on Article 1 of Annex V
Conscious of the imbalance and the discriminatory effect resulting from the most-favoured-nation treatment applicable to products originating in the ACP States on the Community market under Article 1(2)(a) of Annex V, the ACP States reaffirm their understanding that the consultations provided for under this Article shall ensure that the ACP States' main exportable products benefit from treatment at least as favourable as that granted by the Community to countries enjoying the most-favoured-third-state treatment.
In addition similar consultations shall take place in cases where:
(a) one or more ACP States show potentialities for one or more specific products for which preferential third states enjoy more favourable treatment;
(b) one or more ACP States envisage exporting to the Community one or more specific products for which preferential third states enjoy more favourable treatment.
DECLARATION XXXI
Community Declaration on Article 5(2)(a) of Annex V
While agreeing to the reproduction of the text of Article 9(2)(a) of the Second ACP-EEC Convention in Article 5(2)(a) of Annex V, the Community reaffirms the interpretation of that text, namely that the ACP States shall grant to the Community treatment no less favourable than that which they grant to developed States under trade agreements where those States do not grant the ACP States greater preferences than those granted by the Community.
DECLARATION XXXII
Joint Declaration on non-discrimination
The Parties agree that notwithstanding specific provisions of Annex V to this Agreement, the Community shall not discriminate between ACP States in the trade regime provided for in the framework of that Annex, taking account however of the provisions of this Agreement and of specific autonomous initiatives in the multilateral context, such as that in favour of the least developed countries pursued by the Community.
DECLARATION XXXIII
Community Declaration on Article 8(3) of Annex V
Were the Community to adopt the strictly necessary measures referred to in this Article, it would endeavour to seek those which, by reason of their geographical scope or the types of products concerned, would least disturb the exports of the ACP States.
DECLARATION XXXIV
Joint Declaration on Article 12 of Annex V
The Parties agree that the consultations referred to in Article 12 of Annex V should take place in accordance with the following procedures:
(i) the two Parties will provide all necessary and relevant information on the specific issue(s) in good time to enable an early initiation of the discussions, and in any event not later than one month after the request for consultation is received,
(ii) the three-month consultation period will start from the date of receipt of this information. Within these three months, technical examination of such information shall be completed within one month, and joint consultations at the level of the Committee of Ambassadors shall be completed within two further months,
(iii) if the conclusion arrived at is not mutually acceptable, the matter shall be referred to the Council of Ministers,
(iv) in the event that no mutually acceptable solution is adopted by the Council of Ministers, the Council will decide what other steps should be taken in order to resolve the differences identified in the consultations.
DECLARATION XXXV
Joint Declaration relating to Protocol 1 of Annex V
If special tariff treatment were to be applied by the ACP States to imports of products originating in the Community, including Ceuta and Melilla, the provisions of Protocol 1 would apply mutatis mutandis. In all other cases where the treatment applied to imports by the ACP States necessitates the provision of proof of origin, those States shall accept certificates of origin drawn up in accordance with the relevant international agreements.
DECLARATION XXXVI
Joint Declaration relating to Protocol 1 of Annex V
1. For the purposes of applying Article 12(2)(c) of the Protocol, the shipping certificate, issued in the first port of embarkation for the Community, shall be equivalent to the through bill of lading for products covered by movement certificates issued in landlocked ACP States.
2. Products exported from landlocked ACP States which are warehoused elsewhere than in the ACP States or the countries and territories referred to in Annex III to the Protocol may be the subject of movement certificates issued under the circumstances referred to in Article 16 thereof.
3. For the purposes of Article 15(4) of the Protocol, certificates EUR.1 issued by a competent authority and endorsed by the customs authorities will be accepted.
4. In order to help ACP enterprises in their efforts to find new sources of supply with a view to benefiting to the maximum extent from the provisions of the Protocol as regards cumulation of origin, steps will be taken to ensure that the Centre for the Development of Enterprise provides assistance to ACP operators in the establishment of appropriate contacts with suppliers in the ACP States, the Community and the countries and territories, as well as to promote relations in the field of industrial cooperation among the operators concerned.
DECLARATION XXXVII
Joint Declaration relating to Protocol 1 of Annex V on the origin of fishery products
The Community acknowledges the right of the coastal ACP States to the development and rational exploitation of the fishery resources in all waters within their jurisdiction.
The Parties agree that the existing rules of origin have to be examined in order to determine what possible changes may have to be made in the light of the first paragraph.
Conscious of their respective concerns and interests, the ACP States and the Community agree to continue examining the problem posed by the entry, onto Community markets, of fishery products from catches made in zones within the national jurisdiction of the ACP States, with a view to arriving at a solution satisfactory to both sides. This examination will take place in the Customs Cooperation Committee, assisted, when necessary, by the appropriate experts, after entry into force of the Agreement. The results of this examination shall be submitted, within the first year of application of the Agreement, to the Committee of Ambassadors and, at the latest during the second year, to the Council of Ministers for their consideration with a view to arriving at a solution satisfactory to both sides.
For the time being, as regards the processing of fishery products in the ACP States, the Community declares that it is willing to examine with an open mind requests for derogations from the rules of origin for processed products in this production sector based on the existence of compulsory landing requirements provided for in fishery agreements with third countries. The examination the Community is to make will take into account in particular the fact that the third countries concerned should ensure the normal market for such productions, following processing, insofar as the latter are not intended for national or regional consumption.
DECLARATION XXXVIII
Community Declaration relating to Protocol 1 of Annex V on the extent of territorial waters
The Community, recalling that the relevant acknowledged principles of international law restrict the maximum extent of territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, declares that it will take account of this limit in applying the provisions of the Protocol wherever the latter refers to this concept.
DECLARATION XXXIX
ACP Declaration relating to Protocol 1 of Annex V on the origin of fishery products
The ACP States reaffirm the point of view they expressed throughout the negotiations on the rules of origin in respect of fishery products and consequently maintain that following the exercise of their sovereign rights over fishery resources in the waters within their national jurisdiction, including the exclusive economic zone, as defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, all catches effected in those waters and obligatorily landed in ports of the ACP States for processing should enjoy originating status.
DECLARATION XL
Joint Declaration on the application of the value tolerance rule in the tuna sector
The European Community undertakes to implement adequate provisions to give full effect to the application in the tuna sector of the value tolerance rule, provided for in Article 4(2) of Protocol 1 of Annex V. To this end, the Community will submit by the date of signature of this Agreement the conditions under which the 15 % non-originating tuna may be used pursuant to this Article.
The Community proposal will specify how the method of calculation shall be based on the EUR. 1 movement certificate.
The two Parties agree, if difficulties arise in achieving the flexibility aimed at by the application of this method, to undertake a revision of the method after two years of its application.
DECLARATION XLI
Joint Declaration on Article 6(11) of Protocol 1 of Annex V
The Community agrees to consider, in the light of Article 40 of Protocol 1, and on a case-by-case basis, any substantiated requests presented after the signing of the Agreement regarding textile products excluded from cumulation with neighbouring developing countries (Article 6(11) of Protocol 1).
DECLARATION XLII
Joint Declaration on rules of origin: cumulation with South Africa
The ACP-EC Customs Cooperation Committee is prepared to examine as soon as possible any requests for cumulation of working and processing under Article 6(10) of Protocol 1 of Annex V coming from regional bodies representing a high level of regional economic integration.
DECLARATION XLIII
Joint Declaration on Annex 2 to Protocol 1 of Annex V
If in the application of the rules contained in Annex II, ACP States' exports are adversely affected, the Community will examine and, where necessary, adopt appropriate corrective measures to remedy the situation with a view to re-establishing the ex-ante situation (Decision 2/97 of the Council of Ministers).
The Community has noted the requests made by ACP States on rules of origin in the context of the negotiations. The Community agrees to consider any substantiated requests for improvment of the rules of origin contained in Annex II in the light of Article 40 of Protocol 1 and on a case-by-case basis.
