in a directly associated location such as the chartroom or bridge control room at all times;.2 radio operators are responsible for maintaining a continuous radio watch on appropriate frequencies during their periods of duty;.3 officers in charge of an engineering watch, as defined in the stcw code and under the direction of the chief engineer officer, shall be immediately available and on
