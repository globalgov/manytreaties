Party may apply a bilateral safeguard measure on a provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary
determination that there is clear evidence that imports of an originating good from the other Party

and that such imports cause serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The
duration of any provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the Party shall
comply with the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 3.11 (Conditions and Limitations).

safeguard measure shall provide an opportunity for such consultations no later than 30 days after
the application of the bilateral safeguard measure.
2. If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an agreement on trade liberalising
compensation within 30 days after the consultations begin, the Party whose goods are subject to the
safeguard measure may suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the Party
applying the safeguard measure. The exporting Party shall notify the other Party in writing at least
30 days before suspending concessions under this paragraph.
3. The right of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first
24 months during which a bilateral safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the safeguard
measure conforms to the provisions of this Agreement.

their standardising bodies accept and comply with the Code of Good Practice for the Preparation,
Adoption and Application of Standards in Annex 3 to the TBT Agreement.
2. With a view to harmonising standards on as wide a basis as possible, each Party shall
encourage its standardising bodies, as well as the regional standardising bodies of which they or
their standardising bodies are Members, to cooperate with the relevant standardisation bodies of the
other Party in international standardisation activities.
3. The Parties undertake to exchange information on:
(a) their use of standards in support of technical regulations;
(b) each other's standardisation processes, and the extent of use of international standards or
regional standards as a base for their national standards; and
(c) cooperation agreements implemented by either Party on standardisation, provided the
information can be made available to the public.
EU/SG/en 37
ARTICLE 4.6
Technical Regulations
The Parties agree to make best use of good regulatory practice with regard to the preparation,
adoption and application of technical regulations, as provided for in the TBT Agreement including:
(a) considering, when developing a technical regulation, inter alia, the impact of the envisaged
technical regulation and the available regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives to the
proposed technical regulation which may fulfil the Party's legitimate objectives;
(b) using, consistent with Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement and to the maximum extent possible,
relevant international standards as a basis for their technical regulations, except when such
international standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of
the legitimate objectives pursued; where international standards have not been used as a basis,
to explain upon request to the other Party the reasons why such standards have been
considered inappropriate or ineffective for the aim pursued; and
(c) specifying, consistent with Article 2.8 of the TBT Agreement and wherever appropriate,
technical regulations based on product requirements in terms of performance rather than in
terms of design or descriptive characteristics.
EU/SG/en 38
ARTICLE 4.7
Conformity Assessment Procedures
1. The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the acceptance of
the results of conformity assessment procedures, including:
(a) the importing Party's reliance on a supplier's declaration of conformity;
(b) agreements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures with
respect to specific technical regulations conducted by bodies located in the territory of the
other Party;
(c) the use of accreditation procedures to qualify conformity assessment bodies;
(d) government designation of conformity assessment bodies, including bodies located in the
territory of the other Party;
(e) unilateral recognition by a Party of the results of conformity assessment procedures conducted
in the territory of the other Party;
(f) voluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies in the respective territories of
each Party; and
EU/SG/en 39
(g) the use of regional or international multilateral recognition agreements and arrangements of
which the Parties are parties.
2. Having regard, in particular, to those considerations, the Parties shall:
(a) intensify their exchange of information regarding these and other mechanisms, with a view to
facilitating the acceptance of conformity assessment results;
(b) exchange information on the criteria used to select appropriate conformity assessment
procedures for specific products and, in line with Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement, require
that conformity assessment procedures shall not be more strict or be applied more strictly than
is necessary to give the importing Party adequate confidence that products conform with the
applicable technical regulations or standards, taking account of the risks non-conformity
would create;
(c) exchange information on accreditation policies and consider how to make the best use of
international standards for accreditation and the best use of international agreements involving
the Parties' accreditation bodies, for example through the mechanisms of the International
Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation and the International Accreditation Forum; and
(d) ensure that, insofar as two or more conformity assessment bodies are authorised by a Party to
carry out conformity assessment procedures required for placing the product on the market,
economic operators may choose among them.
EU/SG/en 40
3. The Parties reaffirm their obligation under Article 5.2.5 of the TBT Agreement that fees
imposed for mandatory conformity assessment of imported products shall be equitable in relation to
any fees chargeable for assessing the conformity of like products of national origin or originating in
any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other costs arising from
differences between location of facilities of the applicant and the conformity assessment body.
4. Upon request by either Party, the Parties may decide to engage in consultations with a view to
defining sectoral initiatives regarding the use of conformity assessment procedures or the
facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results that are appropriate for the respective
sectors. The Party making the request should substantiate it with relevant information on how this
sectoral initiative would facilitate trade between the Parties. In these consultations, all mechanisms
described in paragraph 1 may be considered. Where a Party declines such a request from the other
Party, it shall, upon request, explain its reasons.
ARTICLE 4.8
Transparency
The Parties reaffirm their transparency obligations under the TBT Agreement with regard to the
preparation, adoption and application of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment
procedures, and agree:
(a) where a part of the process of developing a technical regulation is open to public consultation,
to take the other Party's views into account and, without discrimination, to provide reasonable
opportunities for the other Party and its interested persons to make comments;
EU/SG/en 41
(b) when making notifications in accordance with Article 2.9 of the TBT Agreement, to allow at
least 60 days following the notification for the other Party to provide comments in writing on
the proposal and where practicable, to give appropriate consideration to reasonable requests
for extending the comment period;
(c) to allow sufficient time between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into
force for economic operators of the other Party to adapt, except where urgent problems of
safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise; and
(d) to make available to the other Party or its economic operators relevant information (for
example through a public website, if available) on technical regulations, standards and
conformity assessment procedures in force and, as appropriate and available, written guidance
on compliance with its technical regulations, upon request and without undue delay.
ARTICLE 4.9

The Parties undertake to exchange information on market surveillance and enforcement activities.
EU/SG/en 42
ARTICLE 4.10
Marking and Labelling
1. The Parties note that, according to paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the TBT Agreement, a technical
regulation may include or deal exclusively with marking or labelling requirements, and they agree,
where their technical regulations contain mandatory marking or labelling, to ensure that such
regulations are not prepared with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to
international trade, and that such regulations are not more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a
legitimate objective, as referred to under Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement.
2. The Parties agree that where a Party requires the mandatory marking or labelling of products:
(a) that Party shall endeavour to restrict its requirements only to those which are relevant for
consumers or users of the product or are relevant to indicate the product's conformity with the
mandatory requirements;
(b) that Party may specify the information to be provided on the label, and may require
compliance with certain regulatory requirements for the affixing of the label, but shall not
require any prior approval or certification of labels and markings as a precondition for sale of
the products on its market, unless this is deemed necessary in the light of the risk of the
product to human, animal or plant health or life;
EU/SG/en 43
(c) where that Party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic operators,
that Party shall ensure that such numbers are issued to the relevant economic operators
without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis;
(d) provided it is not misleading, contradictory or confusing in relation to the information
required in the importing Party of the goods, that Party shall permit the following to be used
in the marking or labelling of products:
(i) information in other languages in addition to the information in the language required
by the importing Party of the goods;
(ii) internationally-accepted nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or graphics; and
(iii) additional information to that required in the importing Party of the goods;
(e) that Party shall accept that labelling, including re-labelling and corrections to labelling, may
take place, where relevant, in authorised premises (for example, in customs warehouses at the
point of import) in the territory of the importing Party prior to the distribution and sale of the
product, as an alternative to labelling in the place of origin, unless such labelling in the place
of origin is required for reasons of public health or safety; and
(f) that Party shall endeavour, in cases where it considers that legitimate objectives under the
TBT Agreement are not compromised thereby, to accept non-permanent or detachable labels,
or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than physically attached to
the product.
EU/SG/en 44
3. Without prejudice to the Parties' rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement,
paragraph 2 shall apply to agricultural products, industrial products, and processed agricultural food
products, including beverages and spirits.

or areas of low pest or disease prevalence, it shall provide relevant evidence in order to objectively
demonstrate to the importing Party that such areas are, and are likely to remain, pest- or disease-free
areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence, as the case may be. For this purpose, reasonable
access shall be given, upon request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing and other relevant
procedures.
6. The Parties recognise the principle of compartmentalisation of the OIE and pest-free
production sites of the IPPC. The SPS Committee referred to in Article 5.15 (Committee on
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) will assess any OIE and IPPC recommendations that may be
issued on this matter in the future and may issue recommendations accordingly.

Article 5.12 (Consultations), the Parties shall hold consultations regarding the situation
within 15 calendar days of the notification. These consultations shall be carried out in order to avoid
unnecessary disruptions to trade. The Parties may consider options for the facilitation of the
implementation or the replacement of the measures.
ARTICLE 5.14
Equivalence
1. The Parties may recognise the equivalence of an individual measure, groups of measures or
systems applicable to a sector or to a part of a sector in accordance with paragraphs 4 to 7. The
recognition of equivalence shall be applied to trade between the Parties in animals and animal
products, plants and plant products, or, as appropriate, to related goods.
2. Where equivalence has not been recognised, trade shall take place under the conditions
required by the importing Party to meet its appropriate level of protection.
EU/SG/en 60
3. The recognition of equivalence requires an assessment and acceptance of:
(a) existing SPS measures in legislation, standards and procedures, including controls related to
inspection and certification systems to ensure that the SPS measures of both the exporting
Party and the importing Party are met;
(b) the documented structure of the competent authorities, their powers, their chain of command,
their modus operandi and the resources available to them; and
(c) the performance of the competent authority in relation to the control programmes and
assurances.
4. In their assessments, the Parties shall take account of experience already acquired.
5. The importing Party shall accept a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of the exporting Party as
equivalent if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates that its measure achieves the importing
Party's appropriate level of protection. For this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon
request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.
6. The Parties will take into account guidance of the Codex Alimentarius, OIE, IPPC and the
WTO SPS Committee in recognising equivalence.

energy from renewable and sustainable non-fossil sources, the Parties shall use those standards, or
the relevant parts of those standards, as a basis for their technical regulations except when such
international standards or relevant parts would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the

International Electrotechnical Commission (hereinafter referred to as "IEC"), in particular, shall be
considered relevant international standard-setting bodies.

EU/SG/en 81
2. For greater certainty, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a
manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the
Parties' products, service suppliers or investors where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised
restriction on trade and investment between the Parties, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as
preventing a Party from the adoption or enforcement of measures necessary for the safe operation of
the energy networks concerned, or the safety of energy supply.
ARTICLE 7.7
Implementation and Cooperation
1. The Parties shall cooperate and exchange information on any issues relevant for the
implementation of this Chapter in the Trade Committee established pursuant to Article 16.1 (Trade
Committee). The Parties may, by decision of the Trade Committee, adopt appropriate implementing

National Treatment
1. In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule of Specific Commitments and subject to any
conditions and qualifications set out therein, with respect to all measures affecting establishment2,
each Party shall accord to establishments and entrepreneurs of the other Party treatment no less
favourable than that it accords to its own like establishments and entrepreneurs.
2. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to establishments and
entrepreneurs of the other Party, either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment
to that it accords to its own like establishments and entrepreneurs.
 1 For greater certainty, measures or limitations relating specifically to key personnel and
graduate trainees shall be subject to Article 8.14 (Key Personnel and Graduate Trainees).
2 The obligations in this Article apply also to measures governing the composition of boards of
directors of an establishment, such as nationality and residency requirements.
EU/SG/en 99
3. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if
it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of establishments and entrepreneurs of the Party
compared to like establishments and entrepreneurs of the other Party.

compensate for any inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of
the relevant establishments or entrepreneurs.

purposes. Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the
administrative decision concerned, each Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an
objective and impartial review.
This paragraph shall not be construed as requiring a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures
where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system.
ARTICLE 8.20
Licensing and Qualification Procedures
1. Each Party shall ensure that licensing and qualification procedures and formalities are as
simple as possible and do not unduly complicate or delay the supply of the service. Any licensing or
authorisation fees1 which the applicants may incur from their application should be reasonable and

 1 Licensing or authorisation fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or other nondiscriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service
provision.
EU/SG/en 111
2. Each Party shall ensure that the competent authority uses procedures and takes decisions in

EU/SG/en 112
7. Where the competent authority rejects an application, it shall inform the applicant in writing
without undue delay. In principle, the applicant should, where it so requests, also be informed of the
reasons for rejection of the application and of the timeframe for an appeal against the decision.
Where applicable, an applicant should be permitted, within reasonable time limits, to resubmit an
application.
8. Each Party shall ensure that a licence or an authorisation, once granted, enters into effect
without undue delay in accordance with the terms and conditions specified therein.

Purposes).
EU/SG/en 113
2. The Parties understand that CPC1 84, the United Nations code used for describing computer
and related services, covers all computer and related services. Technological developments have led
to the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of related services that can include
some or all of the basic functions listed in paragraph 3. For example, services such as web or
domain hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic
computer services functions.
3. Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network,
including the Internet, include all services that provide any of the following or any combination
thereof:
(a) consulting, adaptation, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development,
installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical
assistance or management of or for computers or computer systems;
(b) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation,
implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support,
technical assistance, management or use of or for software2;
 1 "CPC" means the Central Products Classification as set out in Statistical Office of the United
Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, N° 77, CPC prov, 1991.
2 The term "software" means the sets of instructions required to make computers work and
communicate. A number of different programmes may be developed for specific applications
(application software), and the customer may have a choice of using ready-made programmes
off the shelf (packaged software), developing specific programmes for particular requirements
(customised software) or using a combination of the two.
EU/SG/en 114
(c) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services;
(d) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers;
and
(e) training services for staff of clients, related to software, computers or computer systems, and
not elsewhere classified.
4. The Parties understand that, in many cases, computer and related services enable the provision
of other services1 by both electronic and other means. However, in such cases, there is an important
distinction between the computer and related service (e.g., web-hosting or application hosting) and
the other service2 enabled by the computer and related service. The other service, regardless of
whether it is enabled by a computer and related service, is not covered by CPC 84.

of the designation of a service supplier as having significant market power and the decision of
regulators, based upon such analysis, to impose, maintain, amend or withdraw such rights and
obligations.

regulatory body does not hold any financial interest or control in such a supplier.

Valuation
6. In estimating the value of a procurement for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is a
covered procurement, a procuring entity shall:
(a) neither divide a procurement into separate procurements nor select or use a particular
valuation method for estimating the value of a procurement with the intention of totally or
partially excluding it from the application of this Chapter; and
(b) include the estimated maximum total value of the procurement over its entire duration,
whether awarded to one or more suppliers, taking into account all forms of remuneration,

options.
EU/SG/en 167
7. Where an individual requirement for a procurement results in the award of more than one
contract, or in the award of contracts in separate parts (hereafter referred to as "recurring
procurements"), the calculation of the estimated maximum total value shall be based on:
(a) the value of recurring procurements of the same type of good or service awarded during the
preceding twelve months or the procuring entity's preceding fiscal year, adjusted where
possible to take into account anticipated changes in the quantity or value of the good or
service being procured over the subsequent twelve months; or
(b) the estimated value of recurring procurements of the same type of good or service to be
awarded during the twelve months subsequent to the initial contract award or the procuring
entity's fiscal year.
8. In the case of procurement by lease, rental, or hire purchase of goods or services, or
procurement for which a total price is not specified, the basis for valuation shall be:
(a) in the case of a fixed-term contract:
(i) where the term of the contract is twelve months or less, the total estimated maximum
value for its duration; or
(ii) where the term of the contract exceeds twelve months, the total estimated maximum
value, including any estimated residual value;

(b) where the contract is for an indefinite period, the estimated monthly instalment multiplied
by 48; and
(c) where it is not certain whether the contract is to be a fixed-term contract, subparagraph (b)
shall be used.
ARTICLE 9.3
Security and General Exceptions
1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as preventing a Party from taking any action or
from not disclosing any information that it considers necessary for the protection of its essential
security interests relating to the procurement of arms, ammunition, or war materials, or to
procurement indispensable for national security or for national defence purposes.
2. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that would
constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties where the same
conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Chapter shall be
construed to prevent any Party from imposing or enforcing measures:
(a) necessary to protect public morals, order, or safety;
(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;
EU/SG/en 169

General Principles
National Treatment and Non-Discrimination
1. With respect to any measure regarding covered procurement, each Party, including its
procuring entities, shall immediately and unconditionally accord to the goods and services of the
other Party and to the suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment
the Party, including its procuring entities, accords to domestic goods, services, and suppliers.
2. With respect to any measure regarding covered procurement, a Party, including its procuring
entities, shall not:
(a) treat a locally established supplier of the other Party less favourably than another locally
established supplier on the basis of degree of foreign affiliation or ownership; or
(b) discriminate against a locally established supplier on the basis that the goods or services
offered by that supplier for a particular procurement are goods or services of the other Party.
EU/SG/en 170
Use of Electronic Means
3. When conducting covered procurement by electronic means, procuring entities shall:
(a) ensure that the procurement is conducted using information technology systems and software,
including those related to authentication and encryption of information, that are generally
available and interoperable with other generally available information technology systems and
software; and
(b) maintain mechanisms that ensure the integrity of requests for participation and tenders,
including establishment of the time of receipt and the prevention of inappropriate access.
Conduct of Procurement

that:
(a) is consistent with this Chapter, using methods such as open tendering, selective tendering, and
limited tendering;
(b) avoids conflicts of interest; and
(c) prevents corrupt practices.
EU/SG/en 171
Rules of Origin
5. For the purposes of covered procurement, neither Party may apply rules of origin to goods or
services imported from or supplied from the other Party that are different from the rules of origin
the Party applies at the same time in the normal course of trade to imports or supplies of the same
goods or services from the other Party.
Offsets
6. With regard to covered procurement, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not seek,
take account of, impose, or enforce any offsets.
Measures Not Specific to Procurement
7. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on, or
in connection with, importation, the method of levying such duties and charges, other import
regulations or formalities, and measures affecting trade in services other than measures governing
covered procurement.
EU/SG/en 172
ARTICLE 9.5
Information on the Procurement System
1. Each Party shall:
(a) promptly publish any law, regulation, judicial decision, administrative ruling of general
application, standard contract clause mandated by law or regulation and incorporated by

4. Procuring entities are encouraged to publish by electronic means through the single point of
access used for the publication of notices of intended procurement as early as possible in each fiscal

planned procurement"). That notice of planned procurement should include the subject-matter of the
procurement and the planned date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement.
EU/SG/en 176
5. Procuring entities covered by Annexes 9-B or 9-C may use a notice of planned procurement
as a notice of intended procurement, provided that the notice of planned procurement includes as
much of the information referred to in paragraph 2 as is available and a statement that interested
suppliers should express their interest in the procurement to the procuring entity.
ARTICLE 9.7
Conditions for Participation
1. Procuring entities shall limit the conditions for participation in a given procurement to those
that are essential to ensure that a supplier has the legal, commercial, technical, and financial ability
to undertake the relevant procurement.
2. In establishing the conditions for participation, procuring entities:
(a) shall not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement, the
supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of a Party,
or that the supplier has prior experience in the territory of that Party; but
(b) may require relevant prior experience where essential to meet the requirements of the
procurement.
EU/SG/en 177
3. In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for participation, procuring entities:
(a) shall evaluate the financial capacity and the commercial and technical abilities of a supplier
on the basis of that supplier's business activities both inside and outside the territory of the
Party of the procuring entity; and
(b) shall base their evaluation on the conditions that they specified in advance in notices or tender
documentation.
4. Where there is supporting evidence, a Party, including its procuring entities, may exclude a
supplier on grounds such as:
(a) bankruptcy;
(b) false declarations;
(c) significant or persistent deficiencies in performance of any substantive requirement or
obligation under a prior contract or contracts;

which interested suppliers are required to register and provide certain information.
2. Each Party shall ensure that:
(a) its procuring entities make efforts to minimise differences in their qualification procedures;
and
(b) where its procuring entities maintain registration systems, those procuring entities make
efforts to minimise differences in their registration systems.
3. Neither Party, including its procuring entities, shall adopt or apply any registration system or
qualification procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to the
participation of suppliers of the other Party in its procurement.
EU/SG/en 179
Selective Tendering
4. Where a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, that procuring entity shall:
(a) in the notice of intended procurement include at least the information in subparagraphs 2(a),
(b), (f), (g), (j), (k), and (l) of Article 9.6 (Notices) and invite suppliers to submit a request for
participation; and
(b) by the commencement of the time period for tendering, provide at least the information in
subparagraphs 2(c), (d), (e), (h), and (i) of Article 9.6 (Notices) to the qualified suppliers that
it notifies in accordance with subparagraph 3(b) of Article 9.10 (Time Periods).
5. Procuring entities shall allow all qualified suppliers to participate in a particular procurement,
unless the procuring entity sets a limit in the notice of intended on the number of suppliers that will
be permitted to tender and states the criteria for selecting the limited number of suppliers. In any
case, the number of suppliers permitted to submit a tender shall be sufficient to ensure competition
without affecting the operational efficiency of the procurement system.
6. Where the tender documentation is not made publicly available from the date of publication
of the notice referred to in paragraph 4, the procuring entity shall ensure that those documents are
made available at the same time to all the qualified suppliers that have been selected in accordance
with paragraph 5.
EU/SG/en 180
Multi-Use Lists
7. Procuring entities may maintain a multi-use list of suppliers, provided that a notice inviting
interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list is:
(a) published annually; and
(b) where published by electronic means, made available continuously, in the appropriate
medium listed in Annex 9-H.
8. The notice provided for in paragraph 7 shall include:
(a) a description of the goods or services, or categories thereof, for which the list may be used;
(b) the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers for inclusion on the list and the
methods that the procuring entity will use to verify that a supplier satisfies the conditions;

EU/SG/en 181
9. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, where a multi-use list will be valid for three years or less,

the period of validity of the list, provided that the notice:
(a) states the period of validity and that further notices will not be published; and
(b) is published by electronic means and is made available continuously during the period of its
validity.
10. Procuring entities shall allow suppliers to apply at any time for inclusion on a multi-use list
and shall include on the list all qualified suppliers within a reasonably short time.
11. Where a supplier that is not included on a multi-use list submits a request for participation in a
procurement based on a multi-use list and all required documents relating thereto within the time
period provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 9.10 (Time Periods), the procuring entity shall
examine the request. The procuring entity shall not exclude the supplier from consideration in
respect of the procurement on the grounds that the procuring entity has insufficient time to examine
the request unless, in exceptional cases, due to the complexity of the procurement, the procuring
entity is not able to complete the examination of the request within the time period allowed for the
submission of tenders.
EU/SG/en 182
Annex 9-C Entities
12. Procuring entities covered under Annex 9-C may use a notice inviting suppliers to apply for
inclusion on a multi-use list as a notice of intended procurement, provided that:
(a) the notice is published in accordance with paragraph 7 and includes the information in
paragraph 8, as much of the information in paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices) as is available,
and a statement that it constitutes a notice of intended procurement or that only the suppliers
on the multi-use list will receive further notices of procurement covered by the multi-use list;
and
(b) the procuring entity promptly provides to suppliers that have expressed an interest to the
procuring entity in a given procurement, sufficient information to permit them to assess their
interest in the procurement, including all remaining information required in paragraph 2 of
Article 9.6 (Notices), to the extent such information is available.
13. Procuring entities covered under Annex 9-C may allow a supplier that has applied for
inclusion on a multi-use list in accordance with paragraph 10 to tender in a given procurement,
where there is sufficient time for the procuring entity to examine whether the supplier satisfies the
conditions for participation.
Information on Procuring Entity Decisions
14. Procuring entities shall promptly inform any supplier that submits a request for participation
or application for inclusion on a multi-use list of the procuring entity's decision with respect to the
request.
EU/SG/en 183
15. Where a procuring entity rejects a supplier's request for participation or application for
inclusion on a multi-use list, ceases to recognise a supplier as qualified, or removes a supplier from
a multi-use list, that procuring entity shall promptly inform the supplier and, at the request of the
supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written explanation of the reasons for its decision.
ARTICLE 9.9
Technical Specifications and Tender Documentation
Technical Specifications
1. Procuring entities shall not prepare, adopt, or apply any technical specification or prescribe
any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary
obstacles to international trade.
2. In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or services being procured, procuring
entities shall, where appropriate:
(a) set out the technical specification in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather
than design or descriptive characteristics; and
(b) base the technical specification on international standards, where such exist; otherwise, on
national technical regulations, recognised national standards, or building codes.
EU/SG/en 184
3. Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the technical specifications, procuring
entities should indicate, where appropriate, that they will consider tenders of equivalent goods or
services that demonstrably fulfil the requirements of the procurement by including words such as
"or equivalent" in the tender documentation.
4. Procuring entities shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a
particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer, or
supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the
procurement requirements, and provided that, in such cases, the procuring entity include words such
as "or equivalent" in the tender documentation.
5. Procuring entities shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of
precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical
specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the
procurement.
6. For greater certainty, each Party, including its procuring entities, may, in accordance with this
Article, prepare, adopt, or apply technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural
resources or protect the environment.
EU/SG/en 185
7. Where procuring entities lay down environmental characteristics in terms of performance or
functional requirement, as referred to in paragraph 2(a), they may consider using the detailed
specification or, if necessary, parts thereof, as defined by eco-labels existing within the Union and
green labels existing in Singapore, provided that:
(a) those specifications are appropriate to define the characteristics of the supplies or services that
are the object of the contract;
(b) the requirements of the label are drawn up on the basis of scientific information; and
(c) those specifications are accessible to all interested parties.
Tender Documentation
8. Procuring entities shall provide to suppliers tender documentation that includes all
information necessary to permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders. Unless already
provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall include a complete
description of:
(a) the procurement, including the nature and the quantity of the goods or services to be procured
or, where the quantity is not known, the estimated quantity and any requirements to be
fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity assessment certification, plans,
drawings, or instructional materials;
EU/SG/en 186
(b) any conditions for participation of suppliers, including a list of information and documents
that suppliers are required to submit in connection with the conditions for participation;
(c) all evaluation criteria that the procuring entity will apply in the awarding of the contract and,
except where price is the sole criterion, the relative importance of such criteria;
(d) where the procuring entity will conduct the procurement by electronic means, any
authentication and encryption requirements or other requirements related to the submission of
information by electronic means;
(e) where the procuring entity will hold an electronic auction, the rules, including identification
of the elements of the tender related to the evaluation criteria, on which the auction will be
conducted;
(f) where there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time, and place for the opening and,
where appropriate, the persons authorised to be present;
(g) any other terms or conditions, including terms of payment and any limitation on the means by
which tenders may be submitted, such as whether on paper or by electronic means; and
(h) any dates for the delivery of goods or the supply of services. 9. In establishing any delivery date for the goods or services being procured, procuring entities
shall take into account such factors as the complexity of the procurement, the extent of
subcontracting anticipated and the realistic time required for production, de-stocking and transport
of goods from the point of supply or for supply of services.
10. Procuring entities may lay down environmental conditions relating to the performance of a
procurement, provided that these are compatible with the rules established by this Chapter and are
indicated in the notice of intended procurement or in another notice used as a notice of intended
procurement1 or tender documentation.
11. The evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or in another notice used
as a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation may include, among others, price and
other cost factors, quality, technical merit, environmental characteristics, and terms of delivery.
12. Procuring entities shall promptly:
(a) make available tender documentation to ensure that interested suppliers have sufficient time
to submit responsive tenders;
 1 For the purposes of paragraphs 10, 11 and 13 of this Article and paragraph 2 of Article
9.11 (Negotiations), "another notice used as a notice of intended procurement" means a notice
of planned procurement falling within paragraph 5 of Article 9.6 (Notices) and a notice
inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion on a multi-use list falling within paragraph 12 of
Article 9.8 (Qualification of Suppliers).
EU/SG/en 188
(b) provide, on request, the tender documentation to any interested supplier; and
(c) reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by any interested or participating
supplier, provided that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over other
suppliers.
Modifications
13. Where, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the criteria or
requirements set out in a notice of intended procurement or in another notice used as a notice of
intended procurement or tender documentation provided to participating suppliers, or amends or
reissues a notice or tender documentation, it shall transmit in writing all such modifications or
amended or re-issued notices or tender documentation:
(a) to all suppliers that are participating at the time of the modification, amendment or
re-issuance, where such suppliers are known to the procuring entity, and in all other cases, in
the same manner as the original information was made available; and
(b) in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and re-submit amended tenders, as
appropriate.
EU/SG/en 189
ARTICLE 9.10
Time Periods
General
1. Procuring entities shall, consistent with their own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time
for suppliers to prepare and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders, taking into
account such factors as:
(a) the nature and complexity of the procurement;
(b) the extent of subcontracting anticipated; and
(c) the time necessary for transmitting tenders by non-electronic means from foreign as well as
domestic points, where electronic means are not used.
Such time-periods, including any extension of the time periods, shall be the same for all interested
or participating suppliers.
Deadlines
2. Procuring entities that use selective tendering shall establish that, in principle, the final date
for the submission of requests for participation shall not be less than 25 days from the date of
publication of the notice of intended procurement. Where a state of urgency duly substantiated by
the procuring entity renders this time period impracticable, the time period may be reduced to not
less than ten days.
EU/SG/en 190
3. Except as provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 8, procuring entities shall establish that the
final date for the submission of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date on which:
(a) in the case of open tendering, the notice of intended procurement is published; or
(b) in the case of selective tendering, the procuring entity notifies suppliers that they will be
invited to submit tenders, whether or not it uses a multi-use list.
4. Procuring entities may reduce the time-period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to not less
than ten days where:
(a) the procuring entity published a notice of planned procurement under paragraph 4 of
Article 9.6 (Notices) at least 40 days and not more than twelve months in advance of the
publication of the notice of intended procurement, and the notice of planned procurement
contains:
(i) a description of the procurement;
(ii) the approximate final dates for the submission of tenders or requests for participation;
(iii) a statement that interested suppliers should express their interest in the procurement to
the procuring entity;
(iv) the address from which documents relating to the procurement may be obtained; and
EU/SG/en 191
(v) as much of the information that is required under paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices)
for the notice of intended procurement, as is available;
(b) the procuring entity, for procurements of a recurring nature, indicated in an initial notice of
intended procurement that subsequent notices will provide time periods for tendering based
on this paragraph; or
(c) a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity has rendered the time period for
tendering established in accordance with paragraph 3 impracticable.
5. Procuring entities may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 by five days
for each one of the following circumstances:
(a) the notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means;
(b) all the tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the date of the
publication of the notice of intended procurement; and
(c) the tenders can be received by electronic means by the procuring entity.
6. The use of paragraph 5, in conjunction with paragraph 4, shall in no case result in the
reduction of the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to less than ten days from the date
on which the notice of intended procurement is published.
EU/SG/en 192
7. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article, where a procuring entity purchases
commercial goods or services, or any combination thereof, it may reduce the time period for
tendering set out in paragraph 3 to not less than thirteen days, provided that it publishes by
electronic means, at the same time, both the notice of intended procurement and the tender
documentation. In addition, where the procuring entity also accepts tenders for commercial goods
and services by electronic means, it may reduce the time period set out in paragraph 3 to not less
than ten days.
8. Where a procuring entity covered under Annexes 9-B or 9-C has selected all or a limited
number of qualified suppliers, the time period for tendering may be fixed by mutual agreement
between the procuring entity and the selected suppliers. In the absence of agreement, the period
shall not be less than ten days.
ARTICLE 9.11
Negotiations
1. Each Party may provide for its procuring entities to conduct negotiations:
(a) where the procuring entity has indicated its intent to conduct negotiations in the notice of
intended procurement required under paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices); or
(b) where it appears from the evaluation that no one tender is obviously the most advantageous in
terms of the specific evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or in
another notice used as a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation.
EU/SG/en 193
2. Procuring entities shall:
(a) ensure that any elimination of suppliers participating in negotiations is carried out in
accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or in
another notice used as a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation; and
(b) where negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the remaining participating
suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.
ARTICLE 9.12
Limited Tendering
1. Provided that they do not use this provision for the purpose of avoiding competition among
suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of the other Party or protects domestic
suppliers, procuring entities may use limited tendering and may choose not to apply
Article 9.6 (Notices), Article 9.7 (Conditions for Participation), Article 9.8 (Qualification of
Suppliers), paragraphs 8 to 13 of Article 9.9 (Technical Specifications and Tender Documentation),
Article 9.10 (Time Periods), Article 9.11 (Negotiations), Article 9.13 (Electronic Auctions), and
Article 9.14 (Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts) only under any of the following
circumstances:
(a) where:
(i) no tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation;
EU/SG/en 194
(ii) no tenders that conform to the essential requirements of the tender documentation were
submitted;
(iii) no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or
(iv) the tenders submitted have been collusive;
provided that the procuring entity does not substantially modify the requirements set out in
the tender documentation;
(b) where the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable
alternative or substitute goods or services exist for any of the following reasons:
(i) the requirement is for a work of art;
(ii) the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or
(iii) due to an absence of competition for technical reasons;
(c) for additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods and services that were not included
in the initial procurement where a change of supplier for such additional goods and services:
(i) cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of
interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services, or
installations procured under the initial procurement; and
EU/SG/en 195
(ii) would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the
procuring entity;
(d) insofar as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events
unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time
using open tendering or selective tendering;
(e) for goods purchased on a commodity market;
(f) where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its
request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or
original development. Original development of a first good or service may include limited
production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that
the good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity at acceptable quality
standards, but does not include quantity production, supply for the purpose of establishing
commercial viability, or the recovery of research and development costs;
(g) for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the very
short term in the case of unusual disposals, such as those arising from liquidation,
receivership, or bankruptcy, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers; and
(h) where a contract is awarded to a winner of a design contest, provided that:
(i) the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with the principles of this
Chapter, in particular relating to the publication of a notice of intended procurement;
and
EU/SG/en 196
(ii) the participants are judged by an independent jury with a view to a design contract
being awarded to a winner.
2. Procuring entities shall prepare a report in writing on each contract awarded under
paragraph 1. The report shall include the name of the procuring entity, the value and kind of goods
or services procured, and a statement indicating the circumstances and conditions described in
paragraph 1 that justified the use of limited tendering.
ARTICLE 9.13
Electronic Auctions
Where a procuring entity intends to conduct a covered procurement using an electronic auction, the
procuring entity shall provide each participant, before commencing the electronic auction, with:
(a) the automatic evaluation method, including the mathematical formula, that is based on the
evaluation criteria set out in the tender documentation and that will be used in the automatic
ranking or re-ranking during the auction;
(b) the results of any initial evaluation of the elements of its tender where the contract is to be
awarded on the basis of the most advantageous tender; and
(c) any other relevant information relating to the conduct of the auction.

Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts
Treatment of Tenders
1. Procuring entities shall receive, open, and treat all tenders in accordance with procedures that
guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement process, and the confidentiality of
tenders.
2. Procuring entities shall not penalise any supplier whose tender is received after the time
specified for receiving tenders if the delay was due solely to mishandling on the part of the
procuring entity.
3. Where a procuring entity provides a supplier with an opportunity to correct unintentional
errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity
shall provide the same opportunity to all participating suppliers.
Awarding of Contracts
4. To be considered for an award, a tender shall have been submitted in writing and shall, at the
time of opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in the notices and tender
documentation, and shall be from a supplier that satisfies the conditions for participation.
EU/SG/en 198
5. Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, the
procuring entity shall award the contract to the supplier that the procuring entity has determined to
be capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the evaluation criteria
specified in the notices and tender documentation, has submitted:
(a) the most advantageous tender; or
(b) where price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.
6. Where a procuring entity receives a tender with a price that is abnormally lower than the
prices in other tenders submitted, it may verify with the supplier that it satisfies the conditions for
participation and is capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract, and whether the price takes into
account the grant of subsidies.
7. Where a procuring entity establishes that a tender is abnormally low because the supplier has
obtained subsidies, it may reject the tender on that ground alone only after having consulted with
the supplier and the latter is unable to prove, within a sufficient period fixed by the procuring entity,
that the subsidy in question was granted in compliance with the disciplines relating to subsidies laid
down in this Agreement.
8. A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a procurement, or modify awarded contracts,
in a manner that circumvents the obligations under this Chapter.
EU/SG/en 199
ARTICLE 9.15
Transparency of Procurement Information
Information Provided to Suppliers
1. Procuring entities shall promptly inform participating suppliers of the procuring entity's
contract award decisions and, upon the request of a supplier, shall do so in writing. Subject to
paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 9.16 (Disclosure of Information), procuring entities shall, upon
request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the procuring
entity did not select its tender and the relative advantages of the successful supplier's tender.
Publication of Award Information
2. Not later than 72 days after the award of each contract covered by this Chapter, the procuring
entity shall publish a notice in the appropriate paper or electronic medium listed in Annex 9-H.
Where the procuring entity publishes the notice only in an electronic medium, the information shall
remain readily accessible for a reasonable period of time. The notice shall include at least the
following information:
(a) a description of the goods or services procured;
(b) the name and address of the procuring entity;
(c) the name and address of the successful supplier;
EU/SG/en 200
(d) the value of the successful tender or the highest and lowest offers taken into account in the

to Article 9.12 (Limited Tendering), a description of the circumstances justifying the use of
limited tendering.
Maintenance of Documentation, Reports, and Electronic Traceability
3. Each procuring entity shall, for a period of at least three years from the date it awards a
contract, maintain:
(a) the documentation and reports of tendering procedures and contract awards relating to
covered procurement, including the reports required under Article 9.12 (Limited Tendering);
and
(b) data that ensure the appropriate traceability of the conduct of covered procurement by
electronic means.

4. Each Party agrees to communicate to the other Party the available and comparable statistical
data relevant to the procurement covered by this Chapter.
EU/SG/en 201
ARTICLE 9.16
Disclosure of Information
Provision of Information to Parties
1. Upon the request of a Party, the other Party shall promptly provide any information necessary
to determine whether a procurement was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with this
Chapter, including information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful
tender. In cases where release of the information would prejudice competition in future tenders, the
Party that receives that information shall not disclose such information to any supplier, except after
consultation with, and the agreement of, the Party that provided the information.
Non-Disclosure of Information
2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party, including its procuring entities,
shall not provide to any particular supplier information that might prejudice fair competition
between suppliers.
3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as requiring a Party, including its procuring
entities, authorities, and review bodies, to disclose confidential information where disclosure:
(a) would impede law enforcement;
(b) might prejudice fair competition between suppliers;
EU/SG/en 202
(c) would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons, including the
protection of intellectual property; or
(d) would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.
ARTICLE 9.17
Domestic Review Procedures
1. Each Party shall provide a timely, effective, transparent, and non-discriminatory
administrative or judicial review procedure through which a supplier may challenge:
(a) a breach of this Chapter; or
(b) where the supplier does not have the right to challenge a breach of this Chapter directly under
the domestic law of that Party, a failure to comply with that Party's measures implementing
this Chapter,
arising in the context of a covered procurement in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest. In
any case, each Party shall ensure that the review body, upon a challenge by a supplier, can examine
decisions taken by their respective procuring entities on whether a particular procurement falls
within the procurement that is covered by this Chapter.
EU/SG/en 203
The procedural rules for all challenges shall be in writing and made generally available through
electronic means or a paper medium.
2. In the event of a complaint by a supplier, that there has been a breach or a failure as referred
to in paragraph 1 arising in the context of covered procurement in which the supplier has, or has
had, an interest, the Party of the procuring entity conducting the procurement shall encourage the
procuring entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the complaint through consultations. The
procuring entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any such complaint in a manner
that is not prejudicial to the supplier's participation in on-going or future procurement or to its right
to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial review procedure.
3. Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and submit a challenge,
which in no case shall be less than ten days from the time when the basis of the challenge became
known to the supplier or reasonably should have become known to the supplier.
4. Each Party shall establish or designate at least one impartial administrative or judicial
authority that is independent of its procuring entities for the purpose of receiving and reviewing
challenges by suppliers arising in the context of covered procurements.
5. Where a body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 4 initially reviews a challenge,
the relevant Party shall ensure that the supplier may appeal the initial decision to an impartial
administrative or judicial authority that is independent of the procuring entity whose procurement is
the subject of the challenge.
EU/SG/en 204
6. Each Party shall ensure that a review body that is not a court shall have its decision subject to
judicial review or have procedures that provide that:
(a) the procuring entity shall respond in writing to the challenge and disclose all relevant
documents to the review body;
(b) the participants to the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as "participants") shall have the
right to be heard prior to the decision of the review body on the challenge;
(c) the participants shall have the right to be represented and accompanied;
(d) the participants shall have access to all proceedings;
(e) the participants shall have the right to request that the proceedings take place in public and
that witnesses may be presented; and
(f) the review body shall make its decisions or recommendations, in a timely fashion, in writing,
and shall include an explanation of the basis for each decision or recommendation.
7. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for rapid interim measures to
preserve the supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement. Such interim measures may
result in suspension of the procurement process. The procedures may provide that overriding
adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into
account when deciding whether such measures should be applied. Just cause for not acting shall be
provided in writing.
EU/SG/en 205
8. Each Party shall provide that where a review body has determined that there has been a
breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1, the review body may impose corrective action or
grant compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to either the costs for
the preparation of the tender or the costs relating to the challenge. Where a contract has already
been awarded, the Parties may provide that corrective action is not available.
ARTICLE 9.18
Modification and Rectification of Coverage
Notification of Proposed Modification
1. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any proposed rectification of Annexes 9-A to 9-I,
any transfer of an entity from one of those Annexes to another, any withdrawal of an entity from
those Annexes, or any other modification to those Annexes (such acts collectively referred
hereinafter to as a "modification").
2. For any proposed withdrawal by a Party of a procuring entity from Annexes 9-A to 9-C on the
grounds that government control or influence over the procuring entity's covered procurement has
been effectively eliminated, the Party proposing the modification (hereinafter referred to as
"modifying Party") shall include in the notification evidence that such government control or
influence has been effectively eliminated. Government control or influence over the covered
procurement of entities covered under Annex 9-C is deemed to be effectively eliminated if:
(a) in the case of the Union, the procuring entity performs a competitive activity; and
EU/SG/en 206
(b) in the case of Singapore, the procuring entity has been privatised.
Where government control or influence over the covered procurement of a procuring entity of a
Party has been effectively eliminated, the other Party shall not be entitled to compensatory
adjustments.
3. For any other proposed modification, the modifying Party shall include in the notification
information as to the likely consequences of the change for the coverage provided in this Chapter.
Where the modifying Party proposes to make minor amendments or technical rectifications of a
purely formal nature not affecting covered procurement, it shall notify these modifications at least
every two years.
Resolution of Objection
4. Where the other Party (hereinafter referred to as "objecting Party") objects to the notification
by the modifying Party, the Parties shall seek to resolve the objection through consultations,
including if necessary, consultations at the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and
Government Procurement established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees). In such
consultations, the Parties shall consider:
(a) evidence pertaining to the effective elimination of government control or influence over an
entity's covered procurement in the case of a notification under paragraph 2;
(b) evidence that the proposed modification does not affect coverage in the case of a notification
under paragraph 3; and
EU/SG/en 207
(c) any claims relating to the need for compensatory adjustments arising from modifications
notified according to paragraph 1 or to the level of such adjustments. Such adjustments may
consist either of the compensatory expansion of coverage by the modifying Party or of a
withdrawal of equivalent coverage by the objecting Party, in both cases with a view to
maintaining a balance of rights and obligations and a comparable level of mutually agreed
coverage provided in this Chapter.
5. The Parties may have recourse to the dispute settlement mechanism under
Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) where the objecting Party, after consultations under
paragraph 4, considers that one or more of the following situations exist:
(a) in the case of subparagraph 4(a), government control or influence over an entity's covered
procurement has not been effectively eliminated;
(b) in the case of subparagraph 4(b), a modification does not meet the criteria in paragraph 3 and
which affects coverage, and should be subject to compensatory adjustments; or
(c) in the case of subparagraph 4(c), compensatory adjustments proposed during the consultation
between the Parties are not adequate to maintain a comparable level of mutually agreed
coverage.
EU/SG/en 208
Implementation
6. A proposed modification shall only become effective where:
(a) the objecting Party has not submitted a written objection to the proposed modification to the
modifying Party within 45 days of the date of the notification of the proposed modifications;
(b) the objecting Party has notified the modifying Party of the withdrawal of its objection;
(c) the Parties have reached an agreement after due consultations under paragraph 4; or
(d) the objection has been resolved through the dispute settlement mechanism under paragraph 5.

(g) exchange information relating to government procurement opportunities in each Party,
including those at sub-central levels; and

2. In the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government Procurement established
pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), the Parties may take any decision required for
the purposes of subparagraphs (a) to (h).

Without prejudice to the scope of copyright or related rights contained in each Party's
domestic law, technological measures shall be deemed effective where the use of protected
works, performances, or phonograms is controlled by authors, performers or producers of
phonograms through the application of a relevant access control or protection process, such as
encryption or scrambling, or a copy control mechanism, which achieves the objective of
protection.
2 Nothing in this Chapter shall require Singapore to restrict the importation or domestic sale of
a device that does not render effective a technological measure which sole purpose is to
control market segmentation for legitimate copies of motion pictures, and is not otherwise a
violation of its domestic law.

SUB-SECTION C
GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS1
ARTICLE 10.16
Scope
1. Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) applies to the recognition and protection of
geographical indications for wines, spirits, agricultural products and foodstuffs which are
originating in the territories of the Parties.
2. Geographical indications of a Party that are to be protected by the other Party shall only be
subject to Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) if they are recognised and declared as
geographical indications in their country of origin.
 1 For the purposes of this Chapter, "geographical indications" means indications which identify
a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a
given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its
geographical origin.
EU/SG/en 224
ARTICLE 10.17
System of Protection of Geographical Indications
1. Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, each Party shall establish systems for the
registration and protection of geographical indications in its territory for such categories of wines
and spirits and agricultural products and foodstuffs as it deems appropriate.
2. The systems referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain elements such as:
(a) a domestic register;
(b) an administrative process to verify that the geographical indications entered, or to be entered,
on the domestic register referred to in subparagraph 2(a), identify a good as originating in the
territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that Party's territory, where a given quality,
reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to their geographical
origin;
(c) an objection procedure that allows the legitimate interests of third parties to be taken into
account; and
(d) legal means that permit the rectification and cancellation of entries on the domestic register
referred to in subparagraph 2(a), that take into account the legitimate interests of third parties
and the right holders of the registered geographical indications in question.
EU/SG/en 225
3. The Parties shall, as soon as practicable after the procedures for protection of geographical
indications in each Party1 have been concluded for all the names listed in Annex 10-A, meet to
adopt a decision in the Trade Committee referred to under Article 16.1 (Trade Committee)
regarding the listing in Annex 10-B of the names from Annex 10-A of each Party that have been
and remain protected as geographical indications under the respective Party's system referred to in
paragraph 2.
ARTICLE 10.18
Amendment of List of Geographical Indications
The Parties agree on the possibility of amending the list of geographical indications for wines,
spirits, agricultural products and foodstuffs listed in Annex 10-B to be protected by each Party
under Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications). Such amendments to Annex 10-B shall be subject
to the geographical indications having been and remaining protected as geographical indications
under the respective Party's system referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection
of Geographical Indications).
 1 For the purposes of Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications), in the case of Singapore, the
procedure for protection of geographical indications refers to the domestic registration
procedure under the system established by Singapore pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 10.17
(System of Protection of Geographical Indications).
EU/SG/en 226
ARTICLE 10.19
Scope of Protection of Geographical Indications
1. Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications for wines,
spirits, agricultural products and foodstuffs listed in Annex 10-B that remain protected as
geographical indications under its system as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of
Protection of Geographical Indications), each Party shall provide the legal means for interested
parties to prevent:
(a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests
that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than its true place of origin in
a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good; and
(b) any other use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of
Article 10bis (Unfair Competition) of the Paris Convention.
2. Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications for wines and
spirits listed in Annex 10-B that remain protected as geographical indications under its system as
referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), each
Party shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent the use of any such geographical
indication identifying wines for wines not originating in the place indicated by the geographical
indication in question or identifying spirits for spirits not originating in the place indicated by the
geographical indication in question, even where:
(a) the true origin of the good is indicated;
EU/SG/en 227
(b) the geographical indication is used in translation; or
(c) the geographical indication is accompanied by expressions such as "kind", "type", "style",
"imitation", or the like.
3. Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications for
agricultural products and foodstuffs listed in Annex 10-B that remain protected as geographical
indications under the Party's system as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of
Protection of Geographical Indications), each Party shall provide the legal means for interested
parties to prevent the use of any such geographical indication identifying a good for a like good1 not
originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question, even where:
(a) the true origin of the good is indicated;
(b) the geographical indication is used in translation;2 or
 1 For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 1 of Article 10.21 (Relationship with
Trademarks), the term "like good", in relation to a good for which a geographical indication
has been protected in a Party's system as referred to in Article 10.17 (System of Protection of
Geographical Indications), means a good that would fall within the same category of good in
that Party's register as the good for which a geographical indication has been registered.
2 For greater certainty, it is understood that this is assessed on a case-by-case basis. This
provision does not apply where evidence is provided that there is no link between the
protected geographical indication and the translated term. It is further understood that this
provision applies without prejudice to the general rules of Sub-Section C (Geographical
Indications).
EU/SG/en 228
(c) the geographical indication is accompanied by expressions such as "kind", "type", "style",
"imitation", or the like.
4. Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its
provisions in respect of a geographical indication in the case of the failure of a right holder to:
(a) renew the registration of the geographical indication in that Party's market; or
(b) maintain minimal commercial activity or interest in the geographical indication in that Party's
market, including commercialisation, promotion or market monitoring.
5. Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement, each Party shall
determine the practical conditions under which homonymous geographical indications will be
differentiated from each other in its territory, taking into account the need to ensure equitable
treatment of the producers concerned and the need to ensure that consumers are not misled.
6. Where a Party receives an application for registration or protection of a geographical
indication that is homonymous with one of the geographical indications in Annex 10-B, that Party
will take into consideration the views and submissions of the applicant and the producers
concerned1 in determining the conditions under which the homonymous geographical indications
will be differentiated from each other.
 1 In the case of Singapore, "the producers concerned" refers to the right holders in question.
EU/SG/en 229
ARTICLE 10.20
Right of Use of Geographical Indications
The persons who may use a geographical indication protected under Sub-Section C (Geographical
Indications) are not limited to the applicant, provided that such use relates to the goods as identified
by that geographical indication.
ARTICLE 10.21
Relationship with Trademarks
1. Subject to Article 10.22 (General Rules), in respect of geographical indications listed in
Annex 10-B that remain protected as geographical indications under a Party's system as referred to
in paragraph 2 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of Geographical Indications), the registration
of a trademark for goods which contains or consists of a geographical indication that identifies like
goods shall be refused or invalidated ex officio if that Party's domestic law so permits, or at the
request of an interested party, with respect to goods not having the origin of the geographical
indication concerned, provided that the application to register the trademark is submitted after the
date of application for the registration of the geographical indication in the territory concerned.
EU/SG/en 230
2. Without prejudice to paragraph 4, the Parties acknowledge that the existence of a prior
conflicting trademark in the territory of a Party would not completely preclude the registration of a
subsequent geographical indication for like goods in that Party.1
3. Where a trademark has been applied for or has been registered in good faith, or where rights
to a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith, if that possibility is provided by the
Parties' respective domestic laws, and such application, registration or acquisition takes place either:
(a) before the date of application for protection of the geographical indication in the territory
concerned; or
(b) before the geographical indication is protected in its country of origin,
any measures adopted to implement Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall not prejudice
the eligibility for or the validity of the registration of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, on
the basis that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, a geographical indication.
4. The Parties shall have no obligation to protect a geographical indication pursuant to
Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) where, in the light of a reputed or well-known trademark,
such protection is liable to mislead consumers as to the true identity of the product.
 1 In the case of Singapore, a geographical indication which conflicts with a prior existing
trademark is capable of being registered with the consent of the prior existing trademark
rights holder. In the case of the Union, such consent is not a prerequisite to the registration of
a geographical indication which conflicts with a prior existing trademark.
EU/SG/en 231
ARTICLE 10.22
General Rules
1. The conditions for import, export and commercialisation of the products referred to in SubSection C (Geographical Indications) in the territory of a Party shall be governed by the domestic
law of that Party.
2. For agricultural products and foodstuffs, nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications)
shall require a Party to prevent the continued and similar use by any of its nationals or domiciliaries
of any geographical indication of the other Party in connection with goods or services, where those
nationals or domiciliaries have used that geographical indication in a continuous manner with
regard to the same or related goods or services in the territory of that Party either:
(a) for at least ten years preceding 1st January 2004; or
(b) in good faith preceding that date.
3. In relation to the geographical indications to be listed in Annex 10-B, where prior use has
been determined pursuant to:
(a) the opposition proceedings during the domestic registration procedures; or
(b) any legal proceedings,
EU/SG/en 232
such prior use shall be listed in Annex 10-B, in respect of the geographical indication in question, in
accordance with:
(i) the mechanism established in paragraph 3 of Article 10.17 (System of Protection of
Geographical Indications), in the case of subparagraph 3(a); and
(ii) the mechanism established in Article 10.18 (Amendment of List of Geographical Indications),
in the case of subparagraph 3(b).
4. Each Party may determine the practical conditions under which such prior use will be
differentiated from the geographical indication in its territory, taking into account the need to ensure
that consumers are not misled.
5. Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its
provisions in respect of a geographical indication of the other Party with respect to goods or
services for which the relevant indication is identical to the term customary in common language as
the common name for such goods or services in the territory of that Party.
6. Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its
provisions in respect of any name contained in a geographical indication of the other Party with
respect to goods or services for which the name is identical to the term customary in common
language as the common name for such goods or services in the territory of that Party.
EU/SG/en 233
7. Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall require a Party to apply its
provisions in respect of a geographical indication of the other Party with respect to products of the
vine for which the relevant indication is identical to the customary name of a grape variety existing
in the territory of that Party as of the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement in that Party.
8. Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall prevent a Party from protecting as
a geographical indication, in accordance with its domestic law, a term that conflicts with the name
of a plant variety or animal breed.
9. A Party may provide that any request made under Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications)
in connection with the use or registration of a trademark must be presented within five years after
the adverse use of the protected indication has become generally known in that Party or within five
years after the date of registration of the trademark in that Party, provided that the trademark has
been published by that date, if the date of registration is earlier than the date on which the adverse
use became generally known in that Party, and provided that the geographical indication is not used
or registered in bad faith.
10. Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall prejudice the right of any person to
use, in the course of trade, that person's name or the name of that person's predecessor in business,
except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.
11. Nothing in Sub-Section C (Geographical Indications) shall oblige a Party to protect a
geographical indication of the other Party which is not or has ceased to be protected in accordance
with the domestic law of its country of origin. The Parties shall notify each other if a geographical
indication ceases to be protected in its country of origin.

ARTICLE 10.23
Relation to Trade Committee
The Trade Committee established pursuant to Article 16.1 (Trade Committee) shall have the
authority to:
(a) adopt decisions regarding the listing in Annex 10-B referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 10.17
(System of Protection of Geographical Indications); and
(b) amend Annex 10-B in accordance with Article 10.18 (Amendment of List of Geographical

EU/SG/en 235
SUB-SECTION D
DESIGNS
ARTICLE 10.24
Requirements for Protection of Registered Designs1
1. The Parties shall provide for the protection of independently created designs that are new or
original.2 This protection shall be provided by registration and shall confer exclusive rights upon
their holders in accordance with the provisions of Sub-Section D (Designs).3
 1 For the purposes of Sub-Section (Designs), the Union also grants protection to the
unregistered design when it meets the requirements of Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of
12 December 2001 on Community designs, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC)
No 1891/2006 of 18 December 2006.
2 The Parties agree that when the domestic law of a Party so provides, individual character of
designs can also be required. This refers to designs that significantly differ from known
designs or combinations of known designs' features. The Union considers designs to have
individual character if the overall impression it produces on the informed users differs from
the overall impression produced on such a user by any design which has been made available
to the public.
3 It is understood that designs are not excluded from protection simply on the basis that they
constitute a part of an article or product, provided that they are visible, fulfil the criteria of this
paragraph, and:
(a) fulfil any other criteria for design protection; and
(b) are not otherwise excluded from design protection,
under the Parties' respective domestic law.
EU/SG/en 236
2. Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional
considerations.
3. A design right shall not subsist in a design which is contrary to public policy or to accepted
principles of morality.1
ARTICLE 10.25
Rights Conferred by Registration
The owner of a protected design shall have the right to prevent third parties who do not have the
owner's consent from at least making, offering for sale, selling or importing articles that bear or
embody a design which is a copy, or is substantially a copy, of the protected design, where such
acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.
ARTICLE 10.26
Term of Protection
The available term of protection shall be at least ten years from the date of application.
 1 Nothing in this Article precludes either Party from providing other specified exclusions from
design protection under its domestic law. The Parties understand that such exclusions shall
not be extensive.
EU/SG/en 237
ARTICLE 10.27
Exceptions
Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, provided that such
exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected designs, and do
not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking into
account the legitimate interests of third parties.
ARTICLE 10.28
Relationship to Copyright
Each Party shall offer the possibility that a design registered in the territory of a Party in accordance
with Sub-Section D (Designs) is not completely precluded from enjoying protection under the
domestic law of copyright of that Party. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such
protection is enjoyed shall be determined by that Party.1
 1 In the case of Singapore, the extent to which, and the conditions under which, such protection
is enjoyed include the circumstances under section 74 of Singapore's Copyright Act.

ARTICLE 10.29
International Agreements
The Parties recall the obligations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (done at Washington on
19 June 1970, amended on 28 September 1979, and modified on 3 February 1984). The Parties
shall, where appropriate, make all reasonable efforts to comply with Article 1 to Article 16 of the
Patent Law Treaty, adopted in Geneva on 1 June 2000, in a manner consistent with their domestic
law and procedures.
ARTICLE 10.30
Patents and Public Health
1. The Parties recognise the importance of the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public
Health, adopted on 14 November 2001 by the Ministerial Conference of the WTO at Doha. In
interpreting and implementing the rights and obligations under Sub-Section E (Patents) and
Sub-Section F (Protection of Test Data Submitted to Obtain an Administrative Marketing Approval
to put a Pharmaceutical Product on the Market), the Parties shall ensure consistency with this
Declaration.
EU/SG/en 239
2. Each Party shall respect the Decision of the WTO General Council of 30 August 2003 on
Implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public
Health, as well as the Decision of the WTO General Council of 6 December 2005 on Amendment
of the TRIPS Agreement, adopting the Protocol Amending the TRIPS Agreement.
ARTICLE 10.31
Extension of the Duration of the Rights Conferred by a Patent
The Parties recognise that pharmaceutical products1 protected by a patent in their respective
territories may be subject to an administrative marketing approval process before being put on their
respective markets. The Parties shall make available an extension of the duration of the rights
conferred by the patent protection to compensate the patent owner for the reduction in the effective
patent life as a result of the administrative marketing approval process.2 The extension of the
duration of the rights conferred by the patent protection may not exceed five years.3
 1 For the purposes of this Article and Article 10.33 (Protection of Test Data Submitted to
Obtain an Administrative Marketing Approval to put a Pharmaceutical Product on the
Market), the term "pharmaceutical product" shall be defined for each Party by the respective
legislations of the Parties as at the date of signature of this Agreement. In the case of the
Union, the term "pharmaceutical product" refers to "medicinal product".
2 Singapore undertakes to make available an extension of the duration of the rights conferred by
patent protection to compensate the patent owner for the reduction in the effective patent life
as the result of the administrative marketing approval process to substances for diagnosis or
testing and authorised as a medicinal product.
3 The conditions and procedures for the provision of the extension of the patent term shall be
determined by the respective legislations of the Parties. This is without prejudice to a possible
extension for paediatric purposes, if provided for by either Party.

ARTICLE 10.32
Cooperation
The Parties agree to cooperate on initiatives to facilitate:
(a) the granting of patents on the basis of applications filed by applicants of a Party in the other

PROTECTION OF TEST DATA
ARTICLE 10.33
Protection of Test Data Submitted to Obtain an Administrative Marketing Approval
to put a Pharmaceutical Product on the Market
Where a Party requires the submission of test data or studies concerning the safety and efficacy of a
pharmaceutical product prior to granting approval for the marketing of such product, that Party shall
not, for a period of at least five years from the date of approval in that Party, permit third parties to
market the same or a similar product on the basis of the marketing approval granted to the party
which had provided the test data or studies, unless that party has given its consent.1,2,3
 1 The conditions and procedures for the provision of the protection contemplated under this
Article shall be determined by the respective legislations of the Parties.
2 The Parties shall, five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, initiate without
prejudice discussions on the possible extension of the duration of the protection of test data
submitted to obtain an administrative marketing approval to put a pharmaceutical product on
the market.
3 In the context of this Article, it is understood that such confidential supporting test data or
studies shall not be used for the purpose of determining whether to grant any other application
for a period of at least five years:
(a) in the case of Singapore, from the date that the first application is received;
(b) in the case of the Union, from the date of approval of the first application,
unless the party which had provided the test data or studies has given his consent.

ARTICLE 10.34
Protection of Test Data Submitted
to Obtain an Administrative Marketing Approval
to put an Agricultural Chemical Product1 on the Market
1. Where a Party requires the submission of test data or studies concerning the safety and
efficacy of an agricultural chemical product prior to the granting of approval for the marketing of
such product in that Party, the Party shall not, for a period of at least ten years from the date of
approval, permit third parties to market the same or a similar product on the basis of the marketing
approval granted to the party which had provided the test data or studies, unless that party has given
its consent.
 1 In the case of the Union, for the purposes of this Article, "agricultural chemical products"
means active substances and preparations containing one or more active substances, put up in
the form in which they are supplied to the user, intended to:
(a) protect plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or prevent the action of
such organisms, in so far as such substances or preparations are not otherwise defined in
subparagraphs (b) to (e);
(b) influence the life processes of plants, other than as a nutrient (e.g. plant growth
regulators);
(c) preserve plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to
special Council or Commission provisions on preservatives;
(d) destroy undesirable plants; or
(e) destroy parts of plants, check or prevent undesirable growth of plants.
EU/SG/en 243
2. Where a Party provides for measures or procedures to avoid duplicative testing on vertebrate
animals with respect to agricultural chemical products, that Party may provide for the conditions
and circumstances under which third parties may market the same or similar product on the basis of
the marketing approval granted to the party which had provided the test data or studies.
3. Where a Party requires the submission of test data or studies concerning the safety or efficacy
of an agricultural chemical product prior to the granting of an approval for the marketing of such
product, that Party shall endeavour to make best efforts to process the application expeditiously,
with a view to avoiding unreasonable delays.

ARTICLE 10.36
General Obligations
1. The Parties affirm their commitments under Articles 41 to 50 of the TRIPS Agreement, and
shall provide for the measures, procedures and remedies under their respective domestic law against
acts of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, that are in compliance
with such commitments.
2. In particular, the measures, procedures and remedies referred to in paragraph 1, and provided
for by each Party under its domestic law, shall:
(a) take into account, as appropriate, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the
infringement and the interests of third parties;
(b) be fair and equitable;
EU/SG/en 245
(c) not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time limits or unwarranted
delays; and
(d) be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to
provide for safeguards against their abuse.
3. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the capacity of either Party to enforce its domestic law in
general or create any obligation on either Party to amend its existing laws as they relate to the
enforcement of intellectual property rights. Without prejudice to the foregoing general principles,
nothing in this Chapter shall create any obligation on either Party:
(a) to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights that is
distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general; or
(b) with respect to the distribution of resources as between the enforcement of intellectual
property rights and the enforcement of law in general.
EU/SG/en 246
ARTICLE 10.37
Publication of Judicial Decisions
In civil judicial proceedings instituted for infringement of an intellectual property right, each Party
shall take appropriate measures, pursuant to its domestic law and policies, to publish or make
available to the public information on final judicial decisions. Nothing in this Article shall require a
Party to disclose confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement
or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial
interests of particular enterprises, public or private. Each Party may provide for other additional
publicity measures which are appropriate to the particular circumstances, including prominent
advertising.
ARTICLE 10.38
Availability of Civil Measures, Procedures and Remedies
1. Each Party shall make available, in its respective domestic law and to right holders, the civil
measures, procedures and remedies referred to in Section C (Civil Enforcement of Intellectual
Property Rights) for the intellectual property rights as defined in paragraph 2.
EU/SG/en 247
2. For the purposes of Section C (Civil Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights), the
following terms have the following meanings:
(a) "right holders" shall include exclusive licensees as well as federations and associations1
having the legal standing to assert such rights; and
(b) "intellectual property rights" means all categories of intellectual property that are the subject
of Sections 1 to 6 of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement.2
ARTICLE 10.39
Measures for Preserving Evidence
1. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order prompt and
effective provisional measures:
(a) against a party or, where appropriate, a third party over whom the relevant judicial authority
exercises jurisdiction, to prevent an infringement of any intellectual property right from
occurring, and in particular to prevent goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual
property right from entering into the channels of commerce; and
 1 In so far as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law, it is
understood that the phrase "federations and associations" includes collective rights
management bodies and, in the Union context, professional defence bodies which are
regularly recognised as having a right to represent holders of intellectual property rights.
2 A Party may exclude patents from the scope of Section C (Civil Enforcement of Intellectual
Property Rights).
EU/SG/en 248
(b) to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the alleged infringement.
2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to adopt provisional
measures inaudita altera parte where appropriate, in particular where any delay is likely to cause
irreparable harm to the right holder or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being
destroyed. In proceedings conducted inaudita altera parte, each Party shall provide its judicial
authorities with the authority to act expeditiously on requests for provisional measures and to make
a decision without undue delay.
3. At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and in cases of trademark
counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities,
have the authority to order the seizure or taking into custody of suspect goods, of materials and
implements relevant to the act of infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, of
documentary evidence, either original or copies thereof, relevant to the infringement.
4. Each Party shall provide that its authorities have the authority to require the applicant, with
respect to provisional measures, to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy
themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant's right is being infringed or that
such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent
assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent
assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to procedures for such provisional measures.
EU/SG/en 249
5. Where the provisional measures are revoked, or where they lapse due to any act or omission
by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement of an
intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant,
upon the request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury
caused by those measures.
ARTICLE 10.40
Evidence and Right of Information
1. Without prejudice to each Party's domestic law governing privilege, the protection of
confidentiality or the processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial
proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities have
the authority, upon a justified request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative,
the alleged infringer, to provide, to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the
purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its applicable laws and
regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls.
2. The relevant information referred to in paragraph 1 may include information regarding any
person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and regarding the means
of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or
services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved in the production and
distribution of such goods or services and of their channels of distribution.

ARTICLE 10.41
Other Remedies
1. Each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings where a judicial decision is taken
finding an infringement of a right holder's intellectual property right, its judicial authorities shall,
upon application by the right holder, have the authority, at least with respect to pirated copyright
goods and counterfeit trademark goods, to order:
(a) that such infringing goods, without compensation of any sort, be:
(i) destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances; or
(ii) disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm
caused to the right holder; and
(b) that materials and implements, the predominant use of which has been in the manufacture or
creation of such infringing goods, shall be, without undue delay and without compensation of
any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to
minimise the risks of further infringements.
2. In considering any application by a right holder, as referred to in paragraph 1, the need for
proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the
interests of third parties shall be taken into account.
EU/SG/en 251
3. The remedies under this Article may be carried out at the expense of the infringer.
ARTICLE 10.42
Injunctions
Each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings where a judicial decision is taken finding
an infringement of a right holder's intellectual property right, its judicial authorities shall, upon
application by the right holder, have the authority to issue against the infringer or, where
appropriate, against a third party over whom the relevant judicial authority exercises jurisdiction, an
injunction aimed at prohibiting the continuation of the infringement. Where provided for by the
Party's domestic law, non-compliance with an injunction shall, where appropriate, be subject to a
recurring penalty payment with a view to ensuring compliance.
EU/SG/en 252
ARTICLE 10.43
Alternative Measures
Each Party may provide in its domestic law that, in civil judicial proceedings where a judicial
decision is taken finding an infringement of a right holder's intellectual property right, in
appropriate cases and on application by the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for
in Article 10.41 (Other Remedies) and/or Article 10.42 (Injunctions), its judicial authorities have
the authority to order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the
measures provided for in Article 10.41 (Other Remedies) and/or Article 10.42 (Injunctions),
provided that the applicant acted unintentionally and without negligence, the execution of the
measures in question would cause disproportionate harm to the applicant, and pecuniary
compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.1
 1 It is understood that, in the case of Singapore, Singapore may provide that its judicial
authorities have the authority to order pecuniary compensation if that person acted
unintentionally and without negligence, or if execution of the measures in question would
cause him disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears
reasonably satisfactory.
EU/SG/en 253
ARTICLE 10.44
Damages
1. Each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of
intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer who,
knowingly or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity to pay the right
holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered as a result of the
infringement.
2. In determining the amount of damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, a
Party's judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, inter alia, any legitimate measure of
value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or
services measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price.1 At least in cases of copyright
or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial
authorities have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder the infringer's profits that
are attributable to the infringement, whether as an alternative to or in addition to or as part of the
damages.
3. As an alternative to paragraph 2, each Party may provide that its judicial authorities have the
authority, in appropriate cases, to set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at
least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested
authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.
 1 In the case of the Union, this would also include, in appropriate cases, elements other than
economic factors such as the moral prejudice caused to the right holder by the infringement.
EU/SG/en 254
4. Nothing in this Article precludes either Party from providing that where the infringer did not
knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, its judicial authorities
may order the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established.
ARTICLE 10.45
Legal Costs
Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, where appropriate, have the authority to order,
at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning infringement of intellectual property
rights, that the prevailing party be awarded payment by the losing party of court costs or fees and
appropriate attorney's fees, or any other expenses as provided for under that Party's domestic law.
ARTICLE 10.46
Presumptions Relating to Copyright and Related Rights
In civil proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a
presumption that, at least with respect to a literary or artistic work, performance or phonogram, in
the absence of proof to the contrary, the natural or legal person whose name appears on such work,
performance or phonogram in the usual manner, is the right holder and is consequently entitled to
institute infringement proceedings.
EU/SG/en 255
ARTICLE 10.47
Liability of Intermediary Service Providers
1. Subject to paragraphs 2 to 6, each Party shall provide for exemptions or limitations in its
domestic law regarding the liability of, or scope of remedies available against, service providers for
infringements of copyright or related rights or trademarks that take place through systems or
networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.
2. The exemptions or limitations referred to in paragraph 1:
(a) shall cover the functions of:
(i) transmitting,1 or providing access for material without selection and/or modification of
its content2; and
(ii) caching carried out through an automatic process;3 and
 1 It is understood that the function of transmission includes the function of routing.
2 It is understood that the function of providing access for material without selection and/or
modification of the content also refers to any means that is used to access the communication
network and includes instances where connections are provided for the material.
3 It is understood that the process of caching carried out through an automatic process may refer
to the intermediate and temporary storage of material in the course of transmission or
providing access to such material.
EU/SG/en 256
(b) may also cover the functions of:
(i) storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled
or operated by or for the service provider; and
(ii) referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools,
including hyperlinks and directories.
3. Eligibility for the exemptions or limitations in this Article may not be conditioned on the
service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity,
except to the extent consistent with such technical measures.
4. Each Party may prescribe in its domestic law, conditions for service providers to qualify for
the exemptions or limitations in this Article. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 3, each Party may
establish appropriate procedures for effective notifications of claimed infringement and effective
counter-notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake or
misidentification.
5. This Article is without prejudice to the availability of defences to the infringement of
copyright or related rights, or trademarks, that are of general applicability. This Article shall not
affect the possibility of the court or administrative authority of a Party, in accordance with its legal
system, requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement.
6. Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address future
functions of a nature similar to those addressed in this Article.

EU/SG/en 264
CHAPTER ELEVEN
COMPETITION AND RELATED MATTERS
SECTION A
ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT AND MERGERS
ARTICLE 11.1
Principles
1. The Parties recognise the importance of free and undistorted competition in their trade
relations. They acknowledge that anti-competitive business conduct and anti-competitive
transactions have the potential to distort the proper functioning of their markets and undermine the
benefits of trade liberalisation.
EU/SG/en 265
2. To promote free and undistorted competition in all sectors of their economy, each Party shall
maintain in its respective territory comprehensive legislation which effectively addresses the
following practices, where such practices affect trade between the Parties:
(a) horizontal and vertical agreements1 between undertakings, decisions by associations of
undertakings, and concerted practices, which have as their object or effect the prevention,
restriction or distortion of competition in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a
substantial part thereof;
(b) abuses by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territory of either Party as a
whole or in a substantial part thereof; and
(c) concentrations between undertakings which result in a substantial lessening of competition or
which significantly impede effective competition, in particular as a result of the creation or
strengthening of a dominant position in the territory of either Party as a whole or in a
substantial part thereof.
 1 Where the competent authority in Singapore assesses that according to the prohibition laid
down in section 34 of the Competition Act (Chapter 50B), the anti-competitive effects of a
vertical agreement will likely outweigh its pro-competitive effects, the competent authority
will refer the matter to the Minister. The Minister shall decide on the applicability of
section 34 of the Competition Act to the vertical agreement in question. This is without
prejudice to the possibility of the competent authority in Singapore applying section 47 of the
Competition Act, which is applicable to vertical agreements concluded by a dominant firm.
EU/SG/en 266
ARTICLE 11.2
Implementation
1. Each Party shall maintain its autonomy in developing and enforcing its law. The Parties
undertake, however, to maintain authorities that are responsible for, and appropriately equipped to
effectively enforce the legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 11.1 (Principles).
2. The Parties will apply their respective legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of
Article 11.1 (Principles) in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, respecting the principles
of procedural fairness and the rights of defence of the parties concerned, including the right of the
parties concerned to be heard prior to the taking of a decision in a case.
SECTION B
PUBLIC UNDERTAKINGS, UNDERTAKINGS ENTRUSTED
WITH SPECIAL OR EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS AND STATE MONOPOLIES
ARTICLE 11.3
Public Undertakings and Undertakings Entrusted with Special or Exclusive Rights
1. Nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from establishing or maintaining public
undertakings, or entrusting undertakings with special or exclusive rights according to its respective
law.
EU/SG/en 267
2. Each Party shall ensure that public undertakings and undertakings that are entrusted with
special or exclusive rights are subject to the legislation referred to in Section A (Anti-Competitive
Conduct and Mergers), insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in
law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them.
3. Each Party shall ensure that undertakings entrusted with special or exclusive rights do not use
those special or exclusive rights to engage either directly or indirectly, including through their
dealings with their parents, subsidiaries, or other undertakings with common ownership, in anticompetitive practices in another market in respect of which such undertakings have no special or
exclusive rights, that adversely affect investments, trade in goods or services of the other Party.
4. Singapore shall ensure that any public undertaking and any undertaking entrusted with special
or exclusive rights acts solely in accordance with commercial considerations in its purchase or sale
of goods or services, such as with regard to price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation,
and other terms and conditions of purchase or sale, and provides non-discriminatory treatment to
establishments of the Union, to goods of the Union, and to service suppliers of the Union.
EU/SG/en 268
ARTICLE 11.4
State Monopolies
While nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from designating or maintaining
state monopolies, each Party shall adjust state monopolies of a commercial character to ensure no
discrimination is exercised by such monopolies regarding the conditions under which goods and
services are procured from and marketed to natural or legal persons of the other Party.
SECTION C
SUBSIDIES
ARTICLE 11.5
Definition and Scope
1. For the purposes of this Agreement, a subsidy is a measure which fulfils the conditions set out
in Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement, mutatis mutandis, irrespective of whether the subsidy is
granted in relation to the production of goods or of services.1
 1 This paragraph does not prejudice the outcome of future discussions in the WTO on the
definition of subsidies for services. The Parties shall give positive consideration to the
adoption of a possible decision by the Trade Committee to update this Agreement to reflect
the agreement reached at the WTO on the definition of subsidies for services.
EU/SG/en 269
2. Subsidies shall be subject to this Chapter only if they are specific, within the meaning of
Article 2 of the SCM Agreement. Any subsidy falling under Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies)
shall be deemed to be specific.
3. Articles 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies), 11.8 (Other Subsidies) and 11.10 (Review Clause) and
Annex 11-A shall not apply to fisheries subsidies, subsidies related to products covered by Annex 1
of the Agreement on Agriculture and other subsidies covered by the Agreement on Agriculture.
ARTICLE 11.6
Relationship with the WTO
The provisions in this Section are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of a Party under
the WTO Agreement, in particular to apply trade remedies or to engage in dispute settlement
proceedings or other appropriate action against a subsidy granted by the other Party.
ARTICLE 11.7
Prohibited Subsidies
1. With respect to subsidies related to trade in goods, the Parties affirm their rights and
obligations under Article 3 of the SCM Agreement, which is hereby incorporated into and made
part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.
EU/SG/en 270
2. The following subsidies related to trade in goods and services shall be prohibited unless the
subsidising Party upon the request of the other Party has demonstrated that the subsidy in question
does not affect trade of the other Party nor will be likely to do so:
(a) any legal arrangements whereby a government or any public body is responsible for covering
debts or liabilities of certain undertakings without any limitation in law or in fact as to the
amount of those debts and liabilities or the duration of such responsibility; and
(b) any support to insolvent or ailing undertakings in whatever form (such as loans and
guarantees, cash grants, capital injections, provision of assets below market prices, tax
exemptions) without a credible restructuring plan, based on realistic assumptions, with a view
to ensuring the return of the ailing undertaking to long-term viability within a reasonable time,
and without the undertaking itself significantly contributing to the costs of restructuring.1
3. Subparagraphs 2(a) and 2(b) do not prevent a Party from providing subsidies to remedy a
serious disturbance in its economy. A serious disturbance in the economy of a Party means an
exceptional, temporary and significant crisis which affects the whole economy of the Party rather
than a specific region or economic sector of that Party.
4. Subparagraph 2(b) does not apply to subsidies granted as compensation for carrying out
public service obligations nor to subsidies to the coal industry.
 1 This does not prevent the Parties from providing temporary liquidity support in the form of
loan guarantees or loans limited to the amount needed to merely to keep an ailing undertaking
in business for the time necessary to work out a restructuring or liquidation plan.
EU/SG/en 271
ARTICLE 11.8
Other Subsidies
1. The Parties agree to use their best endeavours to apply their competition law or other laws to
remedy or remove distortions of competition caused by other specific subsidies related to trade in
goods and services which are not covered by Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies), insofar as they
affect or are likely to affect trade of either Party, and also to prevent the occurrence of such
situations. Annex 11-A contains guidance in particular on the types of subsidies which do not
produce these effects.
2. The Parties agree to exchange information at the request of either Party and hold a first
dialogue within two years of the entry into force of this Agreement with a view to developing rules
applicable to other subsidies, taking into account developments at multilateral level. To that end, the
Parties may take a decision in the Trade Committee.
ARTICLE 11.9
Transparency
1. Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of subsidies that relate to trade in goods or to
the supply of services. To that end, each Party shall report every two years to the other Party on the
legal basis, the form, and to the extent possible, the amount or budget, and the recipients of
subsidies granted by its government or any public body.
EU/SG/en 272
2. Such report shall be deemed to have been provided if the relevant information was made
available by the Parties, or on their behalf, on a publicly accessible website by June of the second
calendar year after the subsidies were granted.
ARTICLE 11.10
Review Clause
The Parties shall keep under constant review the matters to which reference is made in this Section.
Each Party may refer such matters to the Trade Committee. The Parties agree to review progress in
implementing this Section every two years after the entry into force of this Agreement, unless both
Parties agree otherwise.
SECTION D
GENERAL MATTERS
ARTICLE 11.11
Cooperation and Coordination in Law Enforcement
The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation and coordination to further enhance effective
law enforcement. Their respective authorities shall endeavour to coordinate and cooperate in the
enforcement of their respective laws to fulfil the objective of this Agreement of free and undistorted
competition in their trade relations.
EU/SG/en 273
ARTICLE 11.12
Confidentiality
1. When a Party communicates information under this Agreement, that Party shall ensure the
protection of business secrets and other confidential information.
2. When a Party communicates information in confidence under this Agreement, the receiving
Party shall, consistent with its laws and regulations, maintain the confidentiality of that
communicated information.
ARTICLE 11.13
Consultation
1. To foster mutual understanding between the Parties or to address specific matters that arise
under Section A (Anti-Competitive Conduct and Mergers), Section B (Public Undertakings,
Undertakings Entrusted with Special or Exclusive Rights and State Monopolies) or
Section D (General Matters), each Party upon the request of the other Party, shall enter into
consultations regarding representations made by the other Party. In its requests, the Party shall
indicate, if relevant, how the matter affects trade between the Parties.
EU/SG/en 274
2. The Parties shall promptly discuss, upon the request of a Party, any questions arising from the
interpretation or application of Section A (Anti-Competitive Conduct and Mergers), Section B
(Public Undertakings, Undertakings Entrusted with Special or Exclusive Rights and State
Monopolies) or Section D (General Matters).
3. To facilitate discussion of the matter that is the subject of the consultations, each Party shall
endeavour to provide relevant non-confidential information to the other Party.
ARTICLE 11.14
Dispute Settlement and Mediation Mechanism
Neither Party may have recourse to Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) and
Chapter Fifteen (Mediation Mechanism) for any matter arising under this Chapter except for
Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies).

CHAPTER TWELVE
TRADE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SECTION A
INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS
ARTICLE 12.1
Context and Objectives
1. The Parties recall the Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development of 1992, the Preamble to the WTO Agreement, the Singapore Ministerial Declaration
of the WTO of 1996, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation on Sustainable Development of
2002, the Ministerial Declaration of the UN Economic and Social Council on Generating Full and
Productive Employment and Decent Work for All of 2006, and the International Labour
Organization (hereinafter referred to as "ILO") Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair
Globalization of 2008. In view of these instruments, the Parties reaffirm their commitment to
developing and promoting international trade and their bilateral trade and economic relationship in
such a way as to contribute to sustainable development.
EU/SG/en 276
2. The Parties recognise that economic development, social development and environmental
protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development.
They underline the benefit of cooperation on trade-related social and environmental issues as part of
a global approach to trade and sustainable development.
3. The Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening
or reducing the protections afforded by their domestic labour and environment law. At the same
time, the Parties stress that environmental and labour standards should not be used for protectionist
trade purposes.
4. The Parties recognise that it is their aim to strengthen their trade relations and cooperation in
ways that promote sustainable development in the context of paragraphs 1 and 2. In light of the
specific circumstances of each Party, it is not their intention to harmonise the labour or environment
standards of the Parties.
ARTICLE 12.2
Right to Regulate and Levels of Protection
1. The Parties recognise the right of each Party to establish its own levels of environmental and
labour protection, and to adopt or modify its relevant laws and policies accordingly, consistent with
the principles of the internationally recognised standards or agreements to which it is party, referred
to in Articles 12.3 (Multilateral Labour Standards and Agreements) and 12.6 (Multilateral
Environmental Standards and Agreements).
EU/SG/en 277
2. The Parties shall continue to improve those laws and policies, and shall strive towards
providing and encouraging high levels of environmental and labour protection.
SECTION B

LABOUR ASPECTS1
ARTICLE 12.3
Multilateral Labour Standards and Agreements
1. The Parties recognise the value of international cooperation and agreements on employment
and labour affairs as a response of the international community to economic, employment and
social challenges and opportunities resulting from globalisation. They commit to consulting and
cooperating as appropriate on trade-related labour and employment issues of mutual interest.

Work Agenda as agreed on in the ILO and in the Ministerial Declaration of the UN Economic
and Social Council on Generating Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work for All
of 2006.
EU/SG/en 278
2. The Parties affirm their commitments, under the Ministerial Declaration of the UN Economic
and Social Council on Generating Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work for All of
2006, to recognising full and productive employment and decent work for all as a key element of
sustainable development for all countries and as a priority objective of international cooperation.
The Parties resolve to promote the development of international trade in a way that is conducive to
full and productive employment and decent work for all.
3. In accordance with the obligations assumed under the ILO and the ILO Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up adopted by the International Labour
Conference at its 86th Session in Geneva, June 1998, the Parties commit to respecting, promoting
and effectively implementing the principles concerning the fundamental rights at work, namely:
(a) the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;
(b) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour;
(c) the effective abolition of child labour; and
(d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
The Parties affirm the commitment to effectively implementing the ILO Conventions that Singapore
and the Member States of the Union have ratified respectively.
EU/SG/en 279
4. The Parties will make continued and sustained efforts towards ratifying and effectively
implementing the fundamental ILO conventions, and they will exchange information in this regard.
The Parties will also consider the ratification and effective implementation of other ILO
conventions, taking into account domestic circumstances. The Parties will exchange information in
this regard.
5. The Parties recognise that the violation of fundamental principles and rights at work cannot be
invoked or otherwise used as a legitimate comparative advantage.
ARTICLE 12.4
Labour Cooperation

The Parties recognise the importance of working together on trade-related aspects of labour policies
in order to achieve the objectives of this Agreement. The Parties may initiate cooperative activities
of mutual benefit in areas including, but not limited to:
(a) cooperation in international fora addressing labour aspects of trade and sustainable
development, including, but not limited to, the ILO and Asia-Europe Meeting;
(b) the exchange of information and the sharing of best practices in areas such as labour law and
practices, compliance and enforcement systems, labour dispute management, labour
consultation, labour-management cooperation and occupational safety and health;
EU/SG/en 280
(c) the exchange of views on the positive and negative impacts of this Agreement on labour
aspects of sustainable development and on ways to enhance, prevent or mitigate those
impacts, taking into account sustainability impact assessments carried out by either or both
Parties;
(d) the exchange of views on the promotion of the ratification of fundamental ILO Conventions
and other conventions of mutual interest, as well as on the effective implementation of ratified
conventions;
(e) cooperation on trade-related aspects of the ILO Decent Work Agenda, including on the
interlinkages between trade and full and productive employment, labour market adjustment,
core labour standards, labour statistics, human resources development and lifelong learning,
social protection and social inclusion, social dialogue and gender equality; and
(f) the exchange of views on the trade impact of labour regulations, norms and standards.
ARTICLE 12.5

may affect trade or investment between the Parties, shall take account of relevant scientific and
technical information and related international standards, guidelines or recommendations, if
available, including the precautionary principle as enshrined in such international standards,

Trade and Investment Promoting Sustainable Development
1. The Parties resolve to make continuing special efforts to facilitate and promote trade and
investment in environmental goods and services, including through addressing related non-tariff
barriers. The Parties also recognise the usefulness of efforts to promote trade in goods that are the
subject of voluntary or private sustainable development assurance schemes, such as eco-labelling,
or fair and ethical trade.
2. The Parties shall pay special attention to facilitating the removal of obstacles to trade or
investment concerning climate-friendly goods and services, such as sustainable renewable energy
goods and related services and energy efficient products and services, including through the
adoption of policy frameworks conducive to the deployment of best available technologies and

3. The Parties recognise the need to ensure that, when developing public support systems for
fossils fuels, proper account is taken of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and of the need
to limit distortions of trade as much as possible. While subparagraph 2(b) of
Article 11.7 (Prohibited Subsidies) does not apply to subsidies to the coal industry, the Parties share
the goal of progressively reducing subsidies for fossil fuels. Such reductions may be accompanied
by measures to alleviate the social consequences associated with the transition to low carbon fuels.
In addition, both Parties will actively promote the development of a sustainable and safe low-carbon
economy, such as through investment in renewable energies and energy efficient solutions.
4. When promoting trade and investment, the Parties should make special efforts to promote
corporate social responsibility practices which are adopted on a voluntary basis. In this regard, each
Party shall refer to relevant internationally accepted principles, standards or guidelines to which it
has agreed or acceded, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Global Compact, and the ILO Tripartite
Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. The Parties
commit to exchanging information and cooperating on promoting corporate social responsibility.

with that Party's obligations under the provisions referred to in Article 14.2 (Scope), the Party
against which the complaint was made shall enter into negotiations with the complaining Party with

complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the other Party and to the Trade
Committee, to suspend obligations arising from any provision referred to in Article 14.2 (Scope) at
a level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation. The notification shall
specify the level of obligations that the complaining Party intends to suspend. The complaining
Party may implement the suspension at any moment after the expiry of ten days after the date of
receipt of the notification by the Party complained against, unless the Party complained against has
requested arbitration under paragraph 3.

Agreed Solution); or
(b) the Parties have reached an agreement on whether the measure notified under paragraph 1 of

to in Article 14.2 (Scope); or
EU/SG/en 317
(c) any measure found to be inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 14.2 (Scope)
has been withdrawn or amended so as to bring it into conformity with those provisions, as
ruled under paragraph 2 of Article 14.13 (Review of Any Measure Taken to Comply After the
Suspension of Obligations).

both this Chapter and under the WTO Agreement unless substantially different obligations under

of Article 14.8 (Arbitration Panel Ruling) or when the parties have reached a mutually agreed
solution under Article 14.15 (Mutually Agreed Solution).

authorities under that agreement shall have sole responsibility for determining whether any
inconsistency exists between this Agreement and that agreement.
3. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Party from adopting or maintaining any

reaching a mutual understanding.

between the Parties that fall under Chapters 40, 84, 85, 87 and 94 of the HS 2012 (hereinafter
referred to as "products covered by this Annex").
2. With regard to the products covered by this Annex, the Parties confirm the following shared
objectives and principles:
(a) eliminating and preventing non-tariff barriers to bilateral trade;
(b) promoting compatibility and convergence of regulations based on international
standards;
(c) promoting recognition of approvals based, in particular, on approval schemes applied
under the agreements administered by the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle
Regulations (hereinafter referred to as the "WP.29") within the framework of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (hereinafter referred to as "UNECE");
EU/SG/Annex 2-B/en 2
(d) establishing competitive market conditions based on the principles of openness, nondiscrimination and transparency;
(e) securing the protection of human health, safety and the environment; and
(f) enhancing cooperation to foster continued mutually beneficial development in trade.
ARTICLE 2
International Standards
1. The Parties recognise that the WP.29 is the relevant international standard-setting body for the
products covered by this Annex1.
2. If Singapore decides to introduce a type-approval system for products covered by this Annex,
Singapore will consider becoming a signatory of the Agreement concerning the Adoption of
Uniform Technical Prescriptions for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts which can be
fitted and/or be used on Wheeled Vehicles and the Conditions for Reciprocal Recognition of
Approvals Granted on the Basis of these Prescriptions, done at Geneva on 20 March 1958.
 1 This paragraph is without prejudice to the Parties' rights to accept national standards or
technical regulations of other countries.
EU/SG/Annex 2-B/en 3
ARTICLE 3
Regulatory Convergence
1. (a) The Parties shall at all times refrain from introducing any new domestic technical
regulations that diverge from UNECE Regulations or Global Technical Regulations
(hereinafter referred to as "GTR") in areas covered by such UNECE Regulations or
GTR, or where the completion of such UNECE Regulations or GTR is imminent, unless
there are substantiated reasons, based on scientific or technical information, why a
specific UNECE Regulation is ineffective or inappropriate for ensuring road safety or
for the protection of the environment or public health1.
(b) A Party which introduces a new domestic technical regulation as referred to in
subparagraph (a), upon request of the other Party, shall identify the parts of the domestic
technical regulation which substantially deviate from the relevant UNECE Regulations
or GTR, and shall provide due justification as to the reasons for the deviation.
 1 Paragraphs 1(a) and 2 of Article 3 (Regulatory Convergence) and Article 6 (Other Measures
Restricting Trade) of this Annex are without prejudice to Singapore taking traffic
management measures such as electronic road pricing, on account of Singapore's specific
space constraints.
EU/SG/Annex 2-B/en 4
2. Insofar as a Party has introduced and maintains domestic technical regulations that diverge
from existing UNECE Regulations or GTR in accordance with paragraph 1, that Party shall
review those domestic technical regulations at regular intervals not exceeding five years, with
a view to increasing the convergence of those domestic technical regulations with the relevant
UNECE Regulations or GTR. When reviewing their domestic technical regulations, the
Parties shall consider whether the circumstances that gave rise to the divergence still exist.
The outcome of these reviews, including scientific and technical information used, shall be
notified to the other Party upon request.
3. Singapore shall accept new1 Union products covered by this Annex and which are covered by an
EC or UNECE type-approval certificate on its market as complying with its domestic technical
regulations and conformity assessment procedures, without further testing or marking
requirements to verify or attest compliance with requirements covered by an EC2 or UNECE
type-approval. A certificate of conformity, in the case of whole vehicles, or an EC or UNECE
type-approval mark affixed to the product, in the case of components and separate technical
units, shall be considered sufficient proof of the type-approval certificate.
 1 For the purposes of this paragraph, where the term "new Union products covered by this
Annex" refers to whole vehicles, this term is understood to mean vehicles which have never
been registered before worldwide.
2 For greater clarity, the terms "EC type-approval", "EC type-approval certificate", "certificate
of conformity" and "EC type-approval mark" shall have the meanings assigned to them under
Union legislation, in particular Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and
their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such
vehicles (OJ EU L 263, 9.10.2007, p. 1).
EU/SG/Annex 2-B/en 5
4. The competent administrative authorities of each Party may verify by random sampling in
accordance with its domestic legislation that the products comply with, as appropriate:
(a) all the domestic technical regulations of the Party; or
(b) the domestic technical regulations to which compliance has been attested by an
EC Certificate of conformity, in the case of whole vehicles, or an EC or UNECE mark
affixed to the product, in the case of components and separate technical units, as referred to
in paragraph 3.
Such verification shall be carried out in accordance with the domestic technical regulations
under subparagraphs (a) or (b), as the case may be. Each Party may require a supplier to
withdraw a product from its market where the product concerned does not comply with those
regulations and requirements.
ARTICLE 4
Products with New Technologies or New Features
1. Neither Party shall prevent or unduly delay the placing on its market of a product covered by
this Annex and approved by the exporting Party, on the ground that the product incorporates a
new technology or a new feature that the importing Party has not yet regulated, unless the
importing Party can demonstrate, based on scientific or technical information, that such new
technology or new feature creates a risk for human health, safety or the environment.
EU/SG/Annex 2-B/en 6
2. When a Party refuses the placing on its market, or requires the withdrawal from its market, of
a product of the other Party covered by this Annex on the grounds that it incorporates a new
technology or a new feature creating a risk for human health, safety or the environment, it shall
immediately notify this decision to the other Party and to the economic operators1 concerned.
The notification shall include all relevant scientific or technical information considered in the
Party's decision.

Neither Party shall apply automatic import licensing or non-automatic import licensing2 to the
products covered by this Annex.

other Party under this Annex through other regulatory measures specific to the sector covered by
this Annex. This is without prejudice to the right of each Party to adopt measures necessary for road
safety, the protection of the environment or public health and the prevention of deceptive practices,
provided such measures are based on substantiated scientific or technical information.

2. This Annex shall apply only to standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment
procedures of either Party that relate to the safety and electromagnetic compatibility
(hereinafter referred to as "EMC") of electrical and electronic equipment, electrical household
appliances and consumer electronics, as defined in Appendix 4-A-1 (hereinafter referred to as
"covered products").
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 2
ARTICLE 2
International Standards and Standard-setting Bodies
1. The Parties recognise that the International Organization for Standards (hereinafter referred to
as "ISO"), the International Electrotechnical Commission (hereinafter referred to as "IEC")
and the International Telecommunication Union (hereinafter referred to as "ITU") are the
relevant international standard-setting bodies for EMC and for the safety of products covered
by this Annex1.
2. Where relevant international standards established by ISO, IEC and ITU exist, the Parties
shall use such international standards or the relevant parts of such standards as a basis for any
standard, technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, except for cases where
such international standards or relevant parts would be an ineffective or inappropriate means
for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued by a Party. In such cases, upon the request
of a Party, the other Party shall identify the parts of the respective standard, technical
regulation or conformity assessment procedure which substantially deviate from the relevant
international standard, and shall justify the deviation.

regulations that deviate from existing relevant international standards as referred to in
paragraph 2, that Party shall review such technical regulations at regular intervals, which shall
not exceed five years, in order to assess whether the circumstances that gave rise to the
deviation from the relevant international standard still exist. The outcome of such reviews
shall be communicated to the other Party upon request.

ARTICLE 4
Conformity Assessment Procedures
1. The Parties shall not prepare, adopt or apply conformity assessment procedures with the
purpose or effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade with the other Party. In principle,
Parties should avoid requiring mandatory third-party conformity assessments to prove that

instead should consider the use of a supplier's declaration of conformity and/or post-market
surveillance mechanisms to ensure that products conform with relevant standards or technical
requirements.
2. Except as provided in Article 5 (Safeguard Measures), Article 6 (Exceptions) and
Appendix 4-A-2, insofar as a Party requires a positive assurance of conformity with domestic
technical regulations on the safety and/or EMC of covered products, each Party shall accept
products on its market on the basis of one or more of the following:
(a) a supplier's declaration of conformity, where intervention by a conformity assessment
body or the testing of the product by a recognised test laboratory is not mandatory and,
if testing is undertaken, such testing can be carried out by the manufacturer itself or by a
competent body of its choice; or
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 5
(b) a supplier's declaration of conformity that is based on a test report issued by a
Certification Body ("CB") Testing Laboratory of the other Party under the CB Scheme
of the Worldwide System for Conformity Testing and Certification of Electrotechnical

and that is accompanied by a valid CB Test Certificate that was issued in accordance
with the rules and procedures of the IECEE CB Scheme and with the commitments by
the Parties thereunder; or
(c) a supplier's declaration of conformity that is based on a test report issued by any testing
laboratory or is based on a certificate issued by any certification body in the other Party
that has concluded voluntary arrangements for the mutual acceptance of test reports or
certificates with one or more conformity assessment bodies designated by the importing
Party.
The choice of basis under this paragraph shall rest with the supplier.
3. The supplier's declaration of conformity referred to in paragraph 2 shall be in accordance with
ISO/IEC 17050. The Parties shall accept that the supplier is solely responsible for issuing,
changing or withdrawing the declaration of conformity, for preparing the technical
documentation which shall enable the assessment whether the products concerned conform
with the applicable technical regulations, and for affixing any required markings. The Parties
may require that the declaration of conformity be dated and identify the supplier or the
supplier's authorised representative in their territories, that the person empowered by the
manufacturer or his authorised representative sign the declaration, the products covered by the
declaration, and the applied technical regulations to which the declaration of conformity
relates.
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 6
4. In addition to paragraphs 1 to 3, no Party shall require any form of registration of products or
of suppliers, where such registration could prevent or otherwise delay the placing on the
market of products that comply with the Party's technical regulations. Where a Party reviews
the supplier's declaration, such review shall be limited solely to verifying, on the basis of the
documentation submitted, that the test was done in accordance with the Party's relevant
technical regulations, and that the information contained in the documentation is complete.
Such reviews shall not cause undue delay for the placing of the products on the Party's
market, and the Party shall accept the declaration, without exceptions, if the products comply
with the Party's technical regulations and the documentation submitted is complete. In the
event that a Party rejects a declaration, that Party shall communicate its decision to the
supplier, together with an explanation of the grounds for the rejection. At the request of the
supplier, the Party shall provide information or guidance, as appropriate, on how to rectify the
shortcomings, as well as an explanation of possibilities for appealing the decision.
ARTICLE 5
Safeguard Measures
Notwithstanding Article 4 (Conformity Assessment Procedures), either Party may introduce
requirements for mandatory third-party testing or certification of the EMC or safety of covered
products, or may introduce administrative procedures for approving or reviewing test reports, for
particular covered products under the following conditions:
(a) there exist compelling reasons related to the protection of human health or safety that justify
the introduction of such requirements or procedures, supported by substantiated technical or
scientific information;
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 7
(b) such requirements or procedures are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the
Party's legitimate objectives, taking into account the risks that non-fulfilment would create;
and
(c) the Party could not have reasonably foreseen the need for introducing such requirements or
procedures at the time of entry into force of this Agreement.
Without prejudice to Article 2.10 of the TBT Agreement, before introducing the requirements or
procedures, each Party shall notify the other Party and, following consultations, shall take the
comments of the other Party into account to the greatest extent possible in devising such
requirements or procedures. Any requirements that are introduced shall comply with this Annex to
the greatest extent possible. Once adopted, any requirement or procedure that is introduced shall be
regularly reviewed, and shall be repealed if the reasons for introducing that requirement or
procedure no longer exist.
ARTICLE 6
Exceptions
1. Pursuant to Singapore's agreement to substantially reduce the list of products for which it
requires a positive assurance of conformity with its mandatory safety and/or EMC
requirements, in the form of third-party certification, at the time of entry into force of this
Agreement, Singapore shall only require such third-party certification for the product
categories listed in Appendix 4-A-2.
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 8
2. By the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Singapore shall have undertaken a review of
its Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme with a view to reducing
the number of products categories that are covered by the scheme and listed in
Appendix 4-A-2. Such review shall examine the necessity of maintaining that scheme in its
existing form, or whether that scheme's desired outcomes of ensuring human health and safety
in Singapore can be achieved with simplified procedures that better facilitate trade1.
3. The review referred to in paragraph 2 shall include a risk assessment for each of the products
covered by the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme to ascertain
whether moving towards post-market surveillance in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 4
(Conformity Assessment Procedures) or accepting a positive assurance of conformity in
accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 4 (Conformity Assessment Procedures) would create
unreasonable risks for human health and safety. The risk assessment shall be conducted on the
basis of available scientific and technical information, such as consumer reports on safety
accidents and the non-conformity rate of product inspection. The risk assessment shall also
consider whether the products had been used for their intended end-uses and whether those
products had been used with reasonable and usual care.
 1 For example, Singapore will review the administrative procedures associated with the
Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements) Registration Scheme, including the procedures
for accepting and reviewing test reports and certificates of conformity.
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 9
4. Depending on the outcome of the review referred to in paragraph 3, Singapore may maintain
its requirements for the positive assurance of conformity by means of third-party certification
for those products that are covered by the Consumer Protection (Safety Requirements)
Registration Scheme, and are listed in Appendix 4-A-2, where the results of the risk
assessment referred to in paragraph 3 demonstrate that adopting the procedures in paragraph 2
of Article 4 (Conformity Assessment Procedures) for such products would create
unreasonable risks for human health and safety, or where it would not be possible to set up the
post-market surveillance system to address such risks effectively.
5. Singapore shall table the risk assessment referred to in paragraph 3 for discussion at the first
meeting of the Committee on Trade in Goods. Following the review carried out by Singapore,
the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Trade and Goods may modify Appendix 4-A-2
as appropriate.
6. Insofar as Singapore continues to require positive assurances of conformity with its
mandatory safety and/or EMC requirements in the form of third-party certification for
covered products, Singapore shall accept certificates of conformity with its technical
regulations that have been issued by a conformity assessment body in the Union that was
designated by Singapore.
1 Singapore shall also ensure that, for the purposes of issuing such
certification, the conformity assessment bodies designated by Singapore accept test reports
issued:
 1 Singapore shall comply with this requirement within three years of the entry into force of this
Agreement.
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 10
(a) in accordance with the rules and procedures of the IECEE CB Scheme, and in
accordance with the commitments of the Parties thereunder, by one of the Recognised
CB Testing Laboratories or Recognised CB Manufacturer's Testing Laboratories of
the Union;
(b) in accordance with relevant international standards, guides and recommendations
(including ISO/IEC 17025), by any testing laboratory of the Union that has been
accredited by an accreditation body which is a signatory to the Mutual Recognition
Arrangement of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation or one of its
regional bodies' mutual recognition agreements to which Singapore is a Party; or
(c) by any testing laboratory in the Union that has concluded voluntary arrangements for
mutual acceptance of test reports with one or more conformity assessment bodies
designated by Singapore.
7. Five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, and thereafter at regular intervals that
shall not exceed five years, Singapore shall review Appendix 4-A-2 again, with the aim of
reducing the number of product categories listed therein. Such reviews shall include the risk
assessments laid out in paragraph 3. Singapore shall submit such risk assessments for
discussion at the Committee on Trade in Goods.
8. Following the review carried out by Singapore, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on
Trade and Goods, may modify Appendix 4-A-2 as appropriate.
EU/SG/Annex 4-A/en 11
