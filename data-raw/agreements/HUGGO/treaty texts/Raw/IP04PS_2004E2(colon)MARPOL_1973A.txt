listing of noxious liquid substances and other substances1 for the purpose of the regulations of this annex, noxious liquid substances shall be divided into four categories as follows:.1 category x: noxious liquid substances which, if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations, are deemed to present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health and, therefore, justify the prohibition of the discharge into the marine environment;.2 category y: noxious liquid substances which, if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations, are deemed to present a hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify a limitation on the quality and quantity of the discharge into the marine environment;.3 category z: noxious liquid substances which, if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations, are deemed to present a minor hazard to either marine resources or human health and therefore justify less stringent restrictions on the quality and quantity of the discharge into the marine environment;.4 other substances: substances indicated as os (other substances) in the pollution category column of chapter 18 of the international bulk chemical code which have been evaluated and found to fall outside category x, y or z as defined in regulation 6.1 of this annex because they are, at present, considered to present no harm to marine resources, human health, amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea when discharged into the sea from tank cleaning of deballasting operations. the discharge of bilge or ballast water or other residues or mixtures containing only substances referred to as "other substances" shall not be subject to any requirements of the annex.2 guidelines for use in the categorization of noxious liquid substances are given in appendix 1 to this annex.3 where it is proposed to carry a liquid substance in bulk which has not been categorized under paragraph 1 of this regulation, the governments of parties to the convention involved in the proposed operation shall establish and agree on a provisional assessment for the proposed operation on the basis of the guidelines referred to in paragraph 2 of this regulation. until full agreement among the governments involved has been reached, the substance shall not be carried. as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days after the agreement has been reached, the government of the producing or shipping country, initiating the agreement concerned, shall notify the organization and provide details of the substance and the provisional assessment for annual circulation to all parties for their information. the organization shall maintain a register of all such substances and their provisional assessment until such time as the substances are formally included in the ibc code ARTICLE 3 - surveys and

shall notify the organization of the specific responsibilities and conditions of the authority delegated to the nominated surveyors or recognized organizations, for circulation to parties to the present convention for the information of their officers. 2.5 when a nominated surveyor or recognized organization determines that the condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificate, or is such that the ship is not fit to proceed to sea without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment, such surveyor or organization shall immediately ensure that corrective action is taken and shall in due course notify the administration. if such corrective action is not taken the certificate should be withdrawn and the administration shall be notified immediately, and if the ship is in a port of another party, the appropriate authorities of the port state shall also be notified immediately. when an officer of the administration, a nominated surveyor or a recognized organization has notified the appropriate authorities of the port state, the government of the port state concerned shall give such officer, surveyor or organization any necessary assistance to carry out their obligations under this regulation. when applicable, the government of the port state concerned shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship shall not sail until it can proceed to sea or leave the port for the purpose of proceeding to the nearest appropriate repair yard available without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment. 2.6 in every case, the administration concerned shall fully guarantee the completeness and efficiency of the survey and shall undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this obligation.3.1 the condition of the ship and its equipment shall be maintained to conform with the provisions of the present convention to ensure that the ship in all

completeness of its equipment covered by this annex, the master or owner of the ship shall report at the earliest opportunity to the administration, the recognized organization or the nominated surveyor responsible for issuing the relevant certificate, who shall cause investigations to be initiated to determine whether a survey as required by paragraph 1 of this regulation is necessary. if the ship is in a port of another party, the master or owner shall also report immediately to the appropriate authorities of the port state and the nominated surveyor or recognized organization shall ascertain that such report has been made."regulation 9issue or endorsement of certificate1 an international pollution prevention certificate for the carriage of noxious liquid substances in bulk shall be issued, after an initial or renewal survey in accordance with the provisions of regulation 8 of this annex, to any ship intended to carry noxious liquid substances in bulk and which is engaged in voyages to ports or terminals under the jurisdiction of other parties to the convention.2 such certificate shall be issued or endorsed either by the administration or by any person or organization duly authorized by it. in every case, the administration assumes full responsibility for the certificate.3.1 the government of a party to the convention may, at the request of the administration, cause a ship to be surveyed and, if satisfied that the provisions of this annex are complied with, shall issue or authorize the issue of an international pollution prevention certificate for the carriage of noxious liquid substances in bulk to the ship and, where appropriate, endorse or authorize the endorsement of that certificate on the ship, in accordance with this annex.3.2 a copy of the certificate and a copy of the survey report shall be transmitted as soon as possible to the requesting administration.3.3 a certificate so issued shall contain a statement to the effect that it has been issued at the request of the administration and it shall have the same force and receive the same recognition as the certificate issued under paragraph 1 of this regulation.3.4 no international pollution prevention certificate for the carriage of noxious liquid substances in bulk shall be issued to a ship, which is entitled to fly the flag of a state which is not a party.4 the international pollution prevention certificate for the carriage of noxious liquid substances in bulk shall be drawn up in the form corresponding to the model given in appendix 3 to this annex and shall be at least in english, french or spanish. where entries in an official national language of the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly are also used, this shall prevail in the case of a dispute or discrepancy.regulation 10duration and validity of certificate1 an international pollution prevention certificate for the carriage of noxious liquid substances in bulk shall be issued for a period

certificate.2.2 when the renewal survey is completed after the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate.2.3 when the renewal survey is completed more than 3 months before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the new certificate shall be valid from the date of completion of the renewal survey to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.3 if a certificate is issued for a period of less than 5 years, the administration may extend the validity of the certificate beyond the expiry date to the maximum period specified in paragraph 1 of this regulation, provided that the surveys referred to in regulation 8.1.3 and 8.1.4 of this annex applicable when a certificate is issued for a period of 5 years are carried out as appropriate.4 if a renewal survey has been completed and a new certificate cannot be issued or placed on board the ship before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the person or organization authorized by the administration may endorse the existing certificate and such a certificate shall be accepted as valid for a further period which shall not exceed 5 months from the expiry date.5 if a ship at the time when a certificate expires is not in a port in which it is to be surveyed, the administration may extend the period of validity of the certificate but this extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be surveyed, and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so. no certificates shall be extended for a period longer than 3 months, and a ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new certificate. when the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.6 a certificate issued to a ship engaged on short voyages which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this regulation may be extended by the administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it. when the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.7 in special circumstances, as determined by the administration, a new certificate need not be dated from the date of expiry of the existing certificate as required by paragraph 2.2, 5 or 6 of this regulation. in these special circumstances, the new certificate shall be valid to a date not exceeding 5 years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.8 if an annual or intermediate survey is completed before the period specified in regulation 8 of this annex, then:.1 the anniversary date shown on the certificate shall be amended by endorsement to a date which shall not be more than 3 months later than the date on which the survey was completed;.2 the subsequent annual or intermediate survey required by regulation 8 of this annex shall be completed at the intervals prescribed by that regulation using the new anniversary date;.3 the expiry date may remain unchanged provided one or more annual or intermediate surveys, as appropriate, are carried out so that the maximum intervals between the surveys prescribed by regulation 8 of this annex are not exceeded.9 a certificate issued under regulation 9 of this annex shall cease to be valid in any of the following cases:.1 if the relevant surveys are not completed within the periods specified under regulation 8.1 of this annex;.2 if the certificate is not endorsed in accordance with regulation 8.1.3 or 8.1.4 of this annex;.3 upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another state. a new certificate shall only be issued when the government issuing the new certificate is fully satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the requirements of regulation 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 of this annex. in the case of a transfer between parties, if requested within 3 months after the transfer has taken place, the government of the party whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the administration copies of the certificate carried by the ship before the transfer and, if available, copies of the relevant survey reports ARTICLE 4 - design, construction, arrangement and equipmentregulation 11design, construction, equipment

in category x, y or z does not retain a quantity of residue in excess of 75 litres in the tank and its associated piping. a performance test shall be carried out in accordance with appendix 5 of this annex.4 for a ship other than a chemical tanker constructed before 1 january 2007 which cannot meet the requirements for the pumping and piping arrangements for substances in category z referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this regulation no quantity requirement shall apply. compliance is deemed to be reached if the tank is emptied to the most practicable extent.5 pumping performance tests referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this regulation shall be approved by the administration. pumping performance tests shall use water as the test medium.6 ships certified to carry substances of category x, y or z shall have an underwater discharge outlet (or outlets).7 for ships constructed before 1 january 2007 and certified to carry substances in category z an underwater discharge outlet as required under paragraph 6 of this regulation is not mandatory.8 the underwater discharge outlet (or outlets) shall be located within the cargo area in the vicinity of the turn of the bilge and shall be so arranged as to avoid the re-intake of residue/water mixtures by the ship's seawater intakes.9 the underwater discharge outlet arrangement shall be such that the residue/water mixture discharged into the sea will not pass through the ship's boundary layer. to this end, when the discharge is made normal to the ship's shell plating, the minimum diameter of the discharge outlet is governed by the following equation:d = [(qd) / (5ld)]where:d = minimum diameter of the discharge outlet (m)ld = distance from the forward perpendicular to the discharge outlet (m)qd = the maximum rate selected at which the ship may discharge a residue/water mixture through the outlet (m3/h).10 when the discharge is directed at an angle to the ship's shell plating, the above relationship shall be modified by substituting for qd the component of qd which is normal to the ship's shell plating.11 slop tanksalthough this annex does not require the fitting of dedicated slop tanks, slop tanks may be needed for certain washing procedures. cargo tanks may be used as slop tanks ARTICLE 5 - operational discharges of residues of noxious liquid substancesregulation 13control of discharges of residues of noxious liquid substancessubject to the provisions of regulation 3 of this annex the control of discharges of residues of noxious liquid substances or ballast water, tank washings or other mixtures containing such substances shall be in compliance with the following requirements.1 discharge provisions1.1 the discharge into the sea of residues of substances assigned to category x, y or z or of those provisionally assessed as such or ballast water, tank washings or other mixtures containing such substances shall be prohibited unless such discharges are made in full compliance with the applicable operational requirements contained in this annex.1.2 before any prewash or discharge procedure is carried out in accordance with this regulation, the relevant tank shall be emptied to the maximum extent in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the manual.1.3 the carriage of substances which have not been categorized, provisionally assessed or evaluated as referred to in regulation 6 of this annex or of ballast water, tank washings or other mixtures containing such residues shall be prohibited along with any consequential discharge of such substances into the sea.2 discharge standards2.1 where the provisions in this regulation allow the discharge into the sea of residues of substances in category x, y or z or of those provisionally assessed as such or ballast water, tank washings or other mixtures containing such substances the following discharge standards shall apply:.1 the ship is proceeding en route at a speed of at least 7 knots in the case of self-propelled ships or at least 4 knots in the case of ships which are not self-propelled;.2 the discharge is made below the waterline through the underwater discharge outlet(s) not exceeding the maximum rate for which the underwater discharge outlet(s) is (are) designed; and.3 the discharge is made at a distance of not less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land in a depth of water of not less than 25 metres.2.2 for ships constructed before 1 january 2007 the discharge into the sea of residues of substances in category z or of those provisionally assessed as such or ballast water, tank washings or other mixtures containing such substances below the waterline is not mandatory.2.3 the administration may waive the requirements of paragraph 2.1.3 for substances in category z, regarding the distance of not less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land for ships solely engaged in voyages within waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the state the flag, of which, the ship is entitled to fly. in addition, the administration may waive the same requirement regarding the discharge distance of not less than 12 nautical miles from the nearest land for a particular ship entitled to fly the flag of their state, when engaged in voyages within waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of one adjacent state after the establishment of an agreement, in writing, of a waiver between the two coastal states involved provided that no third party will be affected. information on such agreement shall be communicated to the organization within 30 days for further circulation to the parties to the convention for their information and appropriate action if any.3 ventilation of cargo residuesventilation procedures approved by the administration may be used to remove cargo residues from a tank. such procedures shall be in accordance with appendix 7 of this annex. any water subsequently introduced into the tank shall be regarded as clean and shall not be subject to the discharge requirements in this annex.4 exemption for a prewashon request of the ship's master an exemption for a prewash may be granted by the government of the receiving party, where it is satisfied that:.1 the unloaded tank is to be reloaded with the same substance or another substance compatible with the previous one and that the tank will not be washed or ballasted prior to loading; or.2 the unloaded tank is neither washed nor ballasted at sea. the prewash in accordance with the applicable paragraph of this regulation shall be carried out at another port provided that it has been confirmed in writing that a reception facility at that port is available and is adequate for such a purpose; or.3 the cargo residues will be removed by a ventilation procedure approved by the administration in accordance with appendix 7 of this annex.5 the use of cleaning agents or additives5.1 when a washing medium other than water, such as mineral oil or chlorinated solvent, is used instead of water to wash a tank, its discharge shall be governed by the provisions of either annex i or annex ii, which would apply to the medium had it been carried as cargo. tank washing procedures involving the use of such a medium shall be set out in the manual and be approved by the administration.5.2 when small amounts of cleaning additives (detergent products) are added to water in order to facilitate tank washing, no additives containing pollution category x components shall be used except those components that are readily biodegradable and present in a total concentration of less than 10% of the cleaning additive. no restrictions additional to those applicable to the tank due to the previous cargo shall apply.6 discharge of residues of category x6.1 subject to the provision of paragraph 1, the following provisions shall apply:.1 a tank from which a substance in category x has been unloaded, shall be prewashed before the ship leaves the port of unloading. the resulting residues shall be discharged to a reception facility until the concentration of the substance in the effluent to such facility, as indicated by analyses of samples of the effluent taken by the surveyor, is at or below 0.1% by weight. when the required concentration level has been achieved, remaining tank washings shall continue to be discharged to the reception facility until the tank is empty. appropriate entries of these operations shall be made in the cargo record book and endorsed by the surveyor referred to in regulation 16.1..2 any water subsequently introduced into the tank may be discharged into the sea in accordance with the discharge standards in regulation 13.2..3 where the government of the receiving party is satisfied that it is impracticable to measure the concentration of the substance in the effluent without causing undue delay to the ship, that party may accept an alternative procedure as being equivalent to obtain the required concentration in regulation 13.6.1.1 provided that:.1 the tank is prewashed in accordance with a procedure approved by the administration in compliance with appendix 6 of this annex; and.2 appropriate entries shall be made in the cargo record book and endorsed by the surveyor referred to in regulation 16.1.7 discharge of residues of category y and z7.1 subject to the provision of paragraph 1, the following provisions shall apply:.1 with respect to the residue discharge procedures for substances in category y or z the discharge standards in regulation 13.2 shall apply..2 if the unloading of a substance of category y or z is not carried out in accordance with the manual, a prewash shall be carried out before the ship leaves the port of unloading, unless alternative measures are taken to the satisfaction of the surveyor referred to in regulation 16. 1 of this annex to remove the cargo residues from the ship to quantities specified in this annex. the resulting tank washings of the prewash shall be discharged to a reception facility at the port of unloading or another port with a suitable reception facility provided that it has been confirmed in writing that a reception facility at that port is available and is adequate for such a purpose..3 for high-viscosity or solidifying substances in category y the following shall apply:.1 a prewash procedure as specified in appendix 6 shall be applied;.2 the residue/water mixture generated during the prewash shall be discharged to a reception facility until the tank is empty; and.3 any water subsequently introduced into the tank may be discharged into the sea in accordance with the discharge standards in regulation 13.2.7.2 operational requirements for ballasting and deballasting7.2.1 after unloading, and, if required, after a prewash, a cargo tank may be ballasted. procedures for the discharge of such ballast are set out in regulation 13.2.7.2.2 ballast introduced into a cargo tank which has been washed to such an extent that the ballast contains less than 1 ppm of the substance previously carried, may be discharged into the sea without regard to the discharge rate, ship's speed and discharge outlet location, provided that the ship is not less than 12 miles from the nearest land and in water that is not less than 25 metres deep. the required degree of cleanliness has been achieved when a prewash as specified in appendix 6 has been carried out and the tank has been subsequently washed with a complete cycle of the cleaning machine for ships built before 1 july 1994 or with a water quantity not less than that calculated with k=1.0.7.2.3 the discharge into the sea of clean or segregated ballast shall not be subject to the requirements of this annex.8 discharges in the antarctic area8.1 antarctic area means the sea area south of latitude 60°s.8.2 in the antarctic area any discharge into the sea of noxious liquid substances or mixtures containing such substances is prohibited.regulation 14procedures and

numberport of registry:introduction1 the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, 1973, as modified by the protocol of 1978 relating thereto (hereinafter referred to as marpol 73/78) was established in order to prevent the pollution of the marine environment by discharges into the sea from ships of harmful substances or effluents containing such substances. in order to achieve its aim, marpol 73/78 contains six annexes in which detailed regulations are given with respect to the handling on board ships and the discharge into the sea or release into the atmosphere of six main groups of harmful substances, i.e ANNEX i (mineral oils), annex ii (noxious liquid substances carried in bulk), annex iii (harmful substances carried in packaged forms), annex iv (sewage), annex v (garbage) and annex vi (air pollution).2 regulation 13 of annex ii of marpol 73/78 (hereinafter referred to as annex ii) prohibits the discharge into the sea of noxious liquid substances of categories x, y or z or of ballast water, tank washings or other residues or mixtures containing such substances, except in compliance with specified conditions including procedures and arrangements based upon standards developed by the international maritime organization (imo) to ensure that the criteria specified for each category will be met. ANNEX ii requires that each ship which is certified for the carriage of noxious liquid substances in bulk shall be provided with a procedures and arrangements manual, hereinafter referred to as the manual.4 this manual has been written in accordance with appendix 4 of annex ii and is concerned with the marine environmental aspects of the cleaning of cargo tanks and the discharge of residues and mixtures from these operations. the manual is not a safety guide and reference shall be made to other publications specifically to evaluate safety hazards.5 the purpose of the manual is to identify the arrangements and equipment required to enable compliance with annex ii and to identify for the ship's officers all operational procedures with respect to cargo handling, tank cleaning, slops handling, residue discharging, ballasting and deballasting, which must be followed in order to comply with the requirements of annex ii.6 in addition, this manual, together with the ship's cargo record book and the certificate issued under annex ii [10], will be used by administrations for control purposes in order to ensure full compliance with the requirements of annex ii by this ship.7 the master shall ensure that no discharges into the sea of cargo residues or residue/water mixtures containing category x, y or z substances shall take place, unless such discharges are made in full compliance with the operational procedures contained in this manual.8 this manual has been approved by the administration and no alteration or revision shall be made to any part of it without the prior approval of the administration.index of sections1 main features of marpol 73/78, annex ii2 description of the ship's equipment and arrangements3 cargo unloading procedures and tank stripping4 procedures relating to the cleaning of cargo tanks, the discharge of residues, ballasting and deballastingsection 1 main features of marpol 73/78, annex ii 1.1 the requirements of annex ii apply to all ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk. substances posing a threat of harm to the marine environment are divided into three categories, x, y and z. category x substances are those posing the greatest threat to the marine environment, whilst category z substances are those posing the smallest threat. 1. ANNEX ii prohibits the discharge into the sea of any effluent containing substances falling under these categories, except when the discharge is made under conditions which are specified in detail for each category. these conditions include, where applicable, such parameters as:.1 the maximum quantity of substances per tank which may be discharged into the sea;.2 the speed of the ship during the discharge;.3 the minimum distance from the nearest land during discharge;.4 the minimum depth of water at sea during discharge; and.5 the need to effect the discharge below the waterline.1.3 for certain sea areas identified as "special area" more stringent discharge criteria apply. under annex ii the special area is the antarctic area.1. ANNEX ii requires that every ship is provided with pumping and piping arrangements to ensure that each tank designated for the carriage of category x, y and z substances does not retain after

procedure for testing the efficiency of cargo pumping systems.1.2 background1.2.1 the ability of the pumping system of a tank to comply with regulation 12.1, 12.2 or 12.3 is determined by performing a test in accordance with the procedure set out in section 3 of this appendix. the quantity measured is termed the "stripping quantity". the stripping quantity of each tank shall be recorded in the ship's manual.1.2.2 after having determined the stripping quantity of one tank, the administration may use the determined quantities for a similar tank, provided the administration is satisfied that the pumping system in that tank is similar and operating properly.2 design criteria and performance test2.1 the cargo pumping systems should be designed to meet the required maximum amount of residue per tank and associated piping as specified in regulation 12 of annex ii to the satisfaction of the administration.2.2 in accordance with regulation 12.5 the cargo pumping systems shall be tested with water to prove their performance. such water tests shall, by measurement, show that the system meets the requirements of regulation 12. in respect of regulations 12.1 and 12.2 a tolerance of 50 litres per tank is acceptable.3 water performance test3.1 test condition3.1.1 the ship's trim and list shall be such as to provide favourable drainage to the suction point. during the water test the ship's trim shall not exceed 3° by the stern, and the ship's list shall not exceed 1°.3.1.2 the trim and list chosen for the water test shall be recorded. this shall be the minimum favourable trim and list used during the water test.3.1.3 during the water test means shall be provided to maintain a back-pressure of not less than 100 kpa at the cargo tank's unloading manifold (see figures 5-1 and 5-2).3.1.4 the time taken to complete the water test shall be recorded for each tank, recognizing that this may need to be amended as a result of subsequent tests.3.2 test procedure3.2.1 ensure that the cargo tank to be tested and its associated piping have been cleaned and that the cargo tank is safe for entry.3.2.2 fill the cargo tank with water to a depth necessary to carry out normal end of unloading procedures.3.2.3 discharge and strip water from the cargo tank and its associated piping in accordance with the proposed procedures.3.2.4 collect all water remaining in the cargo tank and its associated piping into a calibrated container for measurement. water residues shall be collected, inter alia, from the following points:.1 the cargo tank suction and its vicinity;.2 any entrapped areas on the cargo tank bottom;.3 the low point drain of the cargo pump; and.4 all low point drains of piping associated with the cargo tank up to the manifold valve.3.2.5 the total water volumes collected above determine the stripping quantity for the cargo tank.3.2.6 where a group of tanks is served by a common pump or piping, the water test residues associated with the common system(s) may be apportioned equally among the tanks provided that the following operational restriction is included in the ship's approved manual: "for sequential unloading of tanks in this group, the pump or piping is not to be washed until all tanks in the group have been unloaded."[editor's note: graphics have been removed, refer to page 61 of original document]the above figures illustrate test arrangements that would provide a backpressure of not less than 100 kpa at the cargo tank's unloading manifold APPENDIX 6 prewash proceduresa for ships built before 1 july 1994a prewash procedure is required in order to meet certain annex ii requirements. this appendix explains how these prewash procedures shall be performed.prewash procedures for non-solidifying substances1 tanks shall be washed by means of a rotary water jet, operated at sufficiently high water pressure. in the case of category x substances cleaning machines shall be operated in such locations that all tank surfaces are washed. in the case of category y substances only one location need be used.2 during washing the amount of water in the tank shall be minimized by continuously pumping out slops and promoting flow to the suction point (positive list and trim). if this condition cannot be met the washing procedure shall be repeated three times, with thorough stripping of the tank between washings.3 those substances which have a viscosity equal to or greater than 50 mpa.s at 20°c shall be washed with hot water (temperature at least 60°c), unless the properties of such substances make the washing less effective.4 the number of cycles of the cleaning machine used shall not be less than that specified in table 6-1. a cleaning machine cycle is defined as the period between two consecutive identical orientations of the tank cleaning machine (rotation through 360°).5 after washing, the tank cleaning machine(s) shall be kept operating long enough to flush the pipeline, pump and filter, and discharge to shore reception facilities shall be continued until the tank is empty.prewash procedures for solidifying substances1 tanks shall be washed as soon as possible after unloading. if possible tanks shall be heated prior to washing.2 residues in hatches and manholes shall preferably be removed prior to the prewash.3 tanks shall be washed by means of a rotary water jet operated at sufficiently high water pressure and in locations to ensure that all tank surfaces are washed.4 during washing the amount of water in the tank shall be minimized by pumping out slops continuously and promoting flow to the suction point (positive list and trim). if this condition cannot be met, the washing procedure shall be repeated three times with thorough stripping of the tank between washings.5 tanks shall be washed with hot water (temperature at least 60°c) unless the properties of such substances make the washing less effective.6 the number of cycles of the cleaning machine used shall not be less than that specified in table 6-1. a cleaning machine cycle is defined as the period between two consecutive identical orientations of the machine (rotation through 360°).7 after washing, the cleaning machine(s) shall be kept operating long enough to flush the pipeline, pump and filter,and discharge to shore reception facilities shall be continues until the tank is empty.table 6-1 - number of cleaning machine cycles to be used in each location[editor's note: following table has been reformatted, refer to page 63 of original document]category of substance [tab] number of cleaning machine cycles [tab] non-solidifying substances [tab] solidifying substancescategory x [tab] 1 [tab] 2category y [tab] 1/2 [tab] 1b for ships built on or after 1 july 1994 and recommendatory for ships built before 1 july 1994a prewash procedure is required in order to meet certain annex ii requirements. this appendix explains how these prewash procedures shall be performed and how the minimum volumes of washing media to be used shall be determined. smaller volumes of washing media may be used based on actual verification testing to the satisfaction of the administration. where reduced volumes are approved an entry to that effect must be recorded in the manual.if a medium other than water is used for the prewash, the provisions regulation 13.5.1 apply. prewash procedures for non-solidifying substances without recycling1 tanks shall be washed by means of a rotary jet(s), operated at sufficiently high water pressure. in the case of category x substances cleaning machines shall be operated in such locations that all tank surfaces are washed. in the case of category y substances only one location need be used.2 during washing the amount of liquid in the tank shall be minimized by continuously pumping out slops and promoting flow to the suction point. if this condition cannot be met, the washing procedure shall be repeated three times, with thorough stripping of the tank between washings.3 those substances which have a viscosity equal to or greater than 50 mpa.s at 20°c shall be washed with hot water (temperature at least 60°c), unless the properties of such substances make the washing less effective.4 the quantities of wash water used shall not be less than those specified in paragraph 20 or determined according to paragraph 21.5 after prewashing the tanks and lines shall be thoroughly stripped.prewash procedures for solidifying substances without recycling6 tanks shall be washed as soon as possible after unloading. if possible, tanks should be heated prior to washing.7 residues in hatches and manholes should preferably be removed prior to the prewash.8 tanks shall be washed by means of a rotary jet(s) operated at sufficiently high water pressure and in locations to ensure that all tank surfaces are washed.9 during washing the amount of liquid in the tank shall be minimized by pumping out slops continuously and promoting flow to the suction point. if this condition cannot be met, the washing procedure shall be repeated three times with thorough stripping of the tank between washings.10 tanks shall be washed with hot water (temperature at least 60°c), unless the properties of such substances make the washing less effective.11 the quantities of wash water used shall not be less than those specified in paragraph 20 or determined according to paragraph 21.12 after prewashing the tanks and lines shall be thoroughly stripped. prewash procedures with recycling of washing medium13 washing with a recycled washing medium may be adopted for the purpose of washing more than one cargo tank. in determining the quantity, due regard must be given to the expected amount of residues in the tanks and the properties of the washing medium and whether any initial rinse or flushing is employed. unless sufficient data are provided, the calculated end concentration of cargo residues in the washing medium shall not exceed 5% based on nominal stripping quantities.14 the recycled washing medium shall only be used for washing tanks having contained the same or similar substance.15 a quantity of washing medium sufficient to allow continuous washing shall be added to the tank or tanks to be washed.16 all tank surfaces shall be washed by means of a rotary jet(s) operated at sufficiently high pressure. the recycling of the washing medium may either be within the tank to be washed or via another tank, e.g. a slop tank.17 the washing shall be continued until the accumulated throughput is not less than that corresponding to the relevant quantities given in paragraph 20 or determined according to paragraph 21.18 solidifying substances and substances with viscosity equal to or greater than 50 mpa.s at 20°c shall be washed with hot water (temperature at least 60°c) when water is used as the washing medium, unless the properties of such substances make the washing less effective.19 after completing the tank washing with recycling to the extent specified in paragraph 17, the washing medium shall be discharged and the tank thoroughly stripped. thereafter, the tank shall be subjected to a rinse, using clean washing medium, with continuous drainage and discharged to a reception facility. the rinse shall as a minimum cover the tank bottom and be sufficient to flush the pipelines, pump and filter.minimum quantity of water to be used in a prewash20 the minimum quantity of water to be used in a prewash is determined by the residual quantity of noxious liquid substance in the tank, the tank size, the cargo properties, the permitted concentration in any subsequent wash water effluent, and the area of operation. the minimum quantity is given by the following formula:[editor's note: equation has been removed, refer to page 65 of original document]whereq = the required minimum quantity in m3r = the residual quantity per tank in m3. the value of r shall be the value demonstrated in the actual stripping efficiency test, but shall not be taken lower than 0.100 m3 for a tank volume of 500 m3 and above and 0.040 m3 for a tank volume of 100 m3 and below. for tank sizes between 100 m3 and 500 m3 the minimum value of r allowed to be used in the calculations is obtained by linear interpolation.for category x substances the value of r shall either be determined based on stripping tests according to the manual, observing the lower limits as given above, or be taken to be 0.9 m.v = tank volume in m3k = a factor having values as follows:category x, non-solidifying, low-viscosity substance, k = 1.2category x, solidifying or high-viscosity substance, k = 2.4category y, non-solidifying, low-viscosity substance k = 0.5category y, solidifying or high-viscosity substance k = 1.0the table below is calculated using the formula with a k factor of 1 and may be used as an easy reference.[editor's note: following table has been reformatted, refer to page 66 of original document]stripping quantity

verification testing for approval of prewash volumes lower than those given in paragraph 20 may be carried out to the satisfaction of the administration to prove that the requirements of regulation 13 are met, taking into account the substances the ship is certified to carry. the prewash volume so verified shall be adjusted for other prewash conditions by application of the factor k as defined in paragraph 20 APPENDIX 7ventilation procedures1 cargo residues of substances with a vapour pressure greater than 5 kpa at 20°c may be removed from a cargo tank by ventilation.2 before residues of noxious liquid substances are ventilated from a tank the safety hazards relating to cargo flammability and toxicity shall be considered. with regard to safety aspects, the operational requirements for openings in cargo tanks in solas 74, as amended, the international bulk chemical code, the bulk chemical code, and the ventilation procedures in the international chamber of shipping (ics) tanker safety guide (chemicals) should be consulted.3 port authorities may also have regulations on cargo tank ventilation.4 the procedures for ventilation of cargo residues from a tank are as follows:.1 the pipelines shall be drained and further cleared of liquid by means of ventilation equipment;.2 the list and trim shall be adjusted to the minimum levels possible so that evaporation of residues in the tank is enhanced;.3 ventilation equipment producing an airjet which can reach the tank bottom shall be used. figure 7-1 could be used to evaluate the adequacy of ventilation equipment used for ventilating a tank of a given depth;.4 ventilation equipment shall be placed in the tank opening closest to the tank sump or suction point;.5 ventilation equipment shall, when practicable, be positioned so that the airjet is directed at the tank sump or suction point and impingement of the airjet on tank structural members is to be avoided as much as possible; and.6 ventilation shall continue until no visible remains of liquid can be observed in the tank. this shall be verified by a visual examination or an equivalent method.[editor's note: graphic has been removed, refer to page
