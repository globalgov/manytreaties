measures should be applied.b. best environmental practice1. in making a selection for individual cases, at least the following graduated range of measures should be considered:(a) provision of information and education to the public and to users about the environmental consequences of a choice of particular activities or products, their use and ultimate disposal;(b) development and application of codes of good environmental practice that cover all aspects of the activity in the product's life;(c) mandatory application of labels informing users of environmental risks related to a product, its use and ultimate disposal;(d) conservation of resources, including energy;(e) making collection and disposal systems available to the public;(f) avoiding the use of hazardous substances or products and the generation of hazardous waste;(g) recycling, recovery and reuse;(h) application of economic instruments to activities, products or groups of products; and(i) establishing a system of licensing, involving a range of restrictions or a ban.2. in determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practice, in general or individual cases, particular consideration should be given to:(a) environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ultimate disposal;(b) substitution by less polluting activities or substances;(c) scale of use;(d) potential environmental benefit or cost of substitute materials or activities;(e) advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(f) time limits for implementation;(g) social and economic implications; and(h) precautionary principle.3. best environmental practice for a particular source may change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, together with changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.4. if the reduction of inputs resulting from the use of best environmental practice does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures may be applied and best environmental practice redefined ANNEX iipriority substances and activities1. the contracting parties shall base measures contemplated in articles 5-7 of
