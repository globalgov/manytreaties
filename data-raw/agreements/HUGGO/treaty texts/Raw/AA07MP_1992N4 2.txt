consumption of the controlled substance in group ii of annex b does not exceed zero. each party producing the substance shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substance does not exceed zero. however, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under paragraph 1 of article 5, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to fifteen per cent of its calculated level of production in 1989. this paragraph will apply save to the extent that the parties decide to permit the level of production or consumption that is necessary to satisfy uses agreed by them to be essential.c ARTICLE 2e: 1, 1, 1- trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) ARTICLE 2e of the protocol shall be replaced by the following article: ARTICLE 2e: 1, 1, 1- trichloroethane (methyl chloroform)1. each party shall ensure that for the twelve-month period commencing on 1 january 1993, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substance in group iii of annex b does not exceed, annually, its calculated level of consumption in 1989. each party producing the substance shall, for the same period, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substance does not exceed, annually, its calculated level of production in 1989. however, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under paragraph 1 of article 5, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to ten per cent of its calculated level of production in 1989.2. each party shall ensure that for the

does not exceed, annually, fifty per cent of its calculated level of production in 1989. however, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under paragraph 1 of article 5,

january 1996, and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substance in group iii of annex b does not exceed zero. each party producing the substance shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substance does not exceed zero. however, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the parties operating under paragraph 1 of article 5, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to fifteen per cent of its calculated level of production for 1989. this paragraph will apply
