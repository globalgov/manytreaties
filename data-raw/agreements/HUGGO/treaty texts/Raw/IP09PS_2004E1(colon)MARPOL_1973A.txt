ob(i) shall be taken not less than 1% of the total volume of cargo oil loaded in cargo tank i, to account for initial exchange losses and dynamic effects due to current and waves..4 in the case of bottom damage, a portion from the outflow from a cargo tank may be captured by non-oil compartments. this effect is approximated by application of the factor cdb(i) for each tank, which shall be taken as follows:cdb(i) = 0.6 for cargo tanks bounded from below by non-oil compartments;cdb(i) = 1.0 for cargo tanks bounded by the bottom shell.8 the probability ps of breaching a compartment from side

probabilistic approach where a summation is carried out over the contributions to the mean outflow from each cargo tank. for certain designs such as those characterized by the occurrence of steps/recesses in bulkheads/decks and for sloping bulkheads and/or a pronounced hull curvature, more rigorous calculations may be appropriate. in such cases one of the following calculation procedures may be applied:.1 the probabilities referred to in 8 and 9 above may be calculated with more precision through application of hypothetical sub-compartments. [3].2 the probabilities referred to in 8 and 9 above may be calculated through direct application of the probability density functions contained in the guidelines referred to in regulation 19.5..3 the oil outflow performance may be evaluated in accordance with the method described in the guidelines referred to in regulation 19.5.11 the following provisions regarding piping arrangements shall apply:.1 lines of piping that run through cargo tanks in a position less than 0.30bs from the ship's side or less than 0.30ds from the ship's bottom shall be fitted with valves or similar closing devices at the point at which they open into any cargo tank. these valves shall be kept closed at sea at any time when the tanks contain cargo oil, except that they may be opened only for cargo transfer needed for essential cargo operations..2 credit for reducing oil outflow through the use of an emergency rapid cargo transfer system or other system arranged to mitigate oil outflow in the event of an accident may be taken into account only after the effectiveness and safety aspects of the system are approved by the organization. submittal for approval shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the guidelines referred to in regulation 19.5.regulation 24damage assumptions1 for the purpose of calculating hypothetical oil outflow from oil tankers in accordance with regulations 25 and 26, three dimensions of the extent of damage of a parallelepiped on the side and bottom of the ship are assumed as follows. in the case of bottom damages two conditions are set forth to be applied individually to the stated portions of the oil tanker..1 side damage:1 longitudinal extent(lc):1/3 l 2/3 or 14.5 metres, whichever is less.2 transverse extent (tc) (inboard from the ship's side b/5 or 11.5 metres, at right angles to the centreline at the level whichever is less corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard):3 vertical extent (vc): from the base line upwards without limit.2 bottom damage:for 0.3l from the any other part of the forward perpendicular shipof the ship1 longitudinal extent (ls): l/10l/10 or 5 metres, whichever is less2 transverse extent (ts):b/6 or 10 metres, 5 metres whichever is less but not ess than 5 metres3 vertical extent from the b/15 or 6 metres, base line (vs):whichever is less2 wherever the symbols given in this regulation appear in this chapter, they have the meaning as defined in this regulation.regulation 25hypothetical outflow of oil1 the hypothetical outflow of oil in the case of side damage (oc) and bottom damage (os) shall be calculated by the following formulae with respect to compartments breached by damage to all conceivable locations along the length of the ship to the extent as defined in regulation 24 of this annex..1 for side damages:.2 oc = swi + s kicifor bottom damages: [tab] (i)os = 1/3 (s ziwi + s zici) [tab] (ii)where: wi = volume of a wing tank in cubic metres assumed to be breached by the damage as specified in regulation 24 of this annex; wi for a segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero.ci = volume of a centre tank in cubic metres assumed to be breached by the damage as specified in regulation 24 of this annex; ci for a segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero.ki = 1- bi/tc when bi is equal to or greater than tc, ki shall be taken equal to zero.zi = 1- hi/vs, when hi is equal to or greater than vs, zi shall be taken equal to zero.bi = width of wing tank in metres under consideration measured inboard from the ship's side at right angles to the centreline at the level corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard.hi = minimum depth of the double bottom in metres under consideration; where no double bottom is fitted hi shall be taken equal to zero.whenever symbols given in this paragraph appear in this chapter, they have the meaning as defined in this regulation.2 if a void space or segregated ballast tank of a length less than lc as defined in regulation 24 of this annex is located between wing oil tanks, oc in formula (i) may be calculated on the basis of volume wi being the actual volume of one such tank (where they are of equal capacity) or the smaller of the two tanks (if they differ in capacity) adjacent to such space, multiplied by si as defined below and taking for all other wing tanks involved in such collision the value of the actual full volume.3 .1 credit shall only be given in respect of double bottom tanks which are either empty or carrying clean water when cargo is carried in the tanks above..2 where the double bottom does not extend for the full length and width of the tank involved, the double bottom is considered non-existent and the volume of the tanks above the area of the bottom damage shall be included in formula (ii) even if the tank is not considered breached because of the installation of such a partial double bottom..3 suction wells may be neglected in the determination of the value hi provided such wells are not excessive in area and extend below the tank for a minimum distance and in no case more than half the height of the double bottom. if the depth of such a well exceeds half the height of the double bottom, hi shall be taken equal to the double bottom height minus the well height.piping serving such wells if installed within the double bottom shall be fitted with valves or other closing arrangements located at the point of connection to the tank served to prevent oil outflow in the event of damage to the piping. such piping shall be installed as high from the bottom shell as possible. these valves shall be kept closed at sea at any time when the tank contains oil cargo, except that they may be opened only for cargo transfer needed for the purpose of trimming of the ship.4 in these case where bottom damage simultaneously involves four centre tanks, the value of os may be calculated according to the formula:os = 1/4 (s ziwi + s zici) [tab] (iii)5 an administration may credit as reducing oil outflow in case of bottom damage, an installed cargo transfer system having an emergency high suction in each cargo oil tank, capable of transferring from a breached tank or tanks to segregated ballast tanks or to available cargo tankage if it can be assured that such tanks will have sufficient ullage. credit for such a system would be governed by ability to transfer in two hours of operation oil equal to one half of the largest of the breached tanks involved and by availability of equivalent receiving capacity in ballast or cargo tanks. the credit shall be confined to permitting calculation of os according to formula (iii). the pipes for such suctions shall be installed at least at a height not less than the vertical extent of the bottom damage vs. the administration shall supply the organization with the information concerning the arrangements accepted by it, for circulation to other parties to the convention.6 this regulation does not apply to oil tankers delivered on or after 1 january 2010, as defined in regulation 1.28.8.regulation 26limitations of size and arrangement of cargo tanks1 except as provided in paragraph 7 below:1. every oil tanker of 150 gross tonnage and above delivered after 31 december 1979, as defined in regulation 1.28.2, and2. every oil tanker of 150 gross tonnage and above delivered on or before 31 december 1979, as defined in regulation 1.28.1, which falls into either of the following categories :.1 a tanker, the delivery of which is after 1 january 1977, or.2 a tanker to which both the following conditions apply:.1 delivery is not later than 1 january 1977;
