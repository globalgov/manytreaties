commenced their sea service before entry into force of the convention for that party within the specific ship department to which those certificates relate. the administration shall ensure that all other candidates for certification shall be examined and certificated in accordance with the convention.(3) a party may, within two years after entry into force of the convention for that party, issue a certificate of service to seafarers who hold neither an appropriate certificate under the convention nor a certificate of competency issued under its laws before entry into force of the convention for that party but who have:(a) served in the capacity for which they seek a certificate of service for not less than three years at sea within the last seven years preceding entry into force of the convention for that party;(b) produced evidence that they have performed that service satisfactorily;(c) satisfied the administration as to medical fitness, including eyesight and hearing, taking into

a dispensation permitting a specified seafarer to serve in a specified ship for a specified period not exceeding six months in a capacity, other than that of the radio officer or radiotelephone operator, except as provided by the relevant radio regulations, for which he does not hold the appropriate certificate, provided that the person to whom the dispensation is issued shall be adequately qualified to fill the vacant post in a safe manner, to the satisfaction of the administration. however, dispensations shall not be granted to a master or chief engineer officer, except in circumstances of force majeure and then only for the shortest possible period.(2) any dispensation granted for a post shall be granted only to a person properly certificated to fill the post immediately below. where certification of the post below is not required by the convention, a dispensation may be issued to a person whose qualification and experience are, in the opinion of the administration, of a clear equivalence to the requirements for the post to be filled, provided that, if such a person holds no appropriate certificate, he shall be required to pass a test accepted by the administration as demonstrating that such a dispensation may safely be issued. in addition, administrations shall ensure that the post in question is filled by the holder of an appropriate certificate as soon as possible.(3) parties shall, as soon as possible after 1 january of each year, send a report to the secretary-general giving information of the total number of dispensations in respect of each capacity for which a certificate is required that have been issued during the year to sea-going ships, together with information as to the numbers of those ships above and below 1,600 gross register tons respectively ARTICLE ixequivalents(1) the convention shall not prevent an administration from retaining or adopting other educational and training arrangements, including those involving sea-going service and shipboard organization especially adapted to technical developments and to special types of ships and trades, provided that the level of sea-going service, knowledge and efficiency as regards navigational and technical handling of ship and cargo ensures a degree of safety at sea and has a preventive effect as regards pollution at least equivalent to the requirements of the convention.(2) details of such arrangements shall be reported as early as practicable to the secretary-general who shall circulate such particulars to all parties ARTICLE xcontrol(1) ships, except those excluded by article iii, are subject, while in the ports of a party, to control by officers duly authorized by that party to verify that all seafarers serving on board who are required to be certificated by the convention are so certificated or hold an appropriate dispensation. such certificates shall be accepted unless there are clear grounds for believing that a certificate has been fraudulently obtained or that the holder of a certificate is not the person to whom that certificate was originally issued.(2) in the event that any deficiencies are found under paragraph (1) or under the procedures specified in regulation i/4 - "control procedures", the officer carrying out the control shall forthwith inform, in writing, the master of the ship and the consul or, in his absence, the nearest diplomatic representative or the maritime authority of the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, so that appropriate action may be taken. such notification shall specify the details of the deficiencies found and the grounds on which the party determines that these deficiencies pose a danger to persons, property or the environment.(3) in exercising the control under paragraph (1) if, taking into account the size and type of the ship and the length and nature of the voyage, the deficiencies referred to in paragraph (3) of regulation i/4 are not corrected and it is determined that this fact poses a danger to persons, property or the environment, the party carrying out the control shall take steps to ensure that the ship will not sail unless and until these requirements are met to the extent that the danger has been removed. the facts concerning the action taken shall be reported promptly to the secretary-general.(4) when exercising

or damage resulting therefrom.(5) this article shall be applied as may be necessary to ensure that no more favourable treatment is given to ships entitled to fly the flag of a non-party than is given to ships entitled to fly the flag of a party ARTICLE xipromotion of technical co-operation(1) parties to the convention shall promote, in consultation with, and with the assistance of, the organization, support for those parties which request technical assistance for:(a) training of administrative and technical personnel;(b) establishment of institutions for the training of seafarers;(c) supply of equipment and facilities for training institutions;(d) development of adequate training programmes, including practical training on sea-going ships; and(e) facilitation of other measures and arrangements to enhance the qualifications of seafarers;preferably on a national, sub-regional or regional basis, to further the aims and purposes of the convention, taking into account the special needs of developing countries in this regard.(2) on its part, the organization shall pursue the aforesaid efforts, as appropriate, in consultation or association with other international organizations, particularly the international labour organisation ARTICLE xiiamendments(1) the convention may be amended by either of the following procedures:(a) amendments after

[footnotes appeared in original text.]regulation i/3principles governing near-coastal voyages1. any party defining near-coastal voyages for the purpose of the convention shall not impose training, experience or certification requirements on the seafarers serving on board the ships entitled to fly the flag of another party and engaged on such voyages in a manner resulting in more stringent requirements for such seafarers than for seafarers serving on board ships entitled to fly its own flag. in no case shall any such party impose requirements in respect of seafarers serving on board ships entitled to fly the flag of another party in excess of those of the convention in respect of ships not engaged on near-coastal voyages.2. with respect to ships entitled to fly the flag of a party regularly engaged on near-coastal voyages off the coast of another party, the party whose flag the ship is entitled to fly shall prescribe training, experience and certification requirements for seafarers serving on such ships at least equal to those of the party off whose coast the ship is engaged, provided that they do not exceed the requirements of the convention in respect of ships not engaged on near-coastal voyages. a ship which extends its voyage beyond what is defined as a near-coastal voyage by a party and enters waters not covered by that definition shall fulfil the requirements of the convention without relaxation under this regulation.3. a party may afford a ship which is entitled to fly its flag the benefits of the near-coastal voyages provisions of the convention when it is regularly engaged off the coast of a non-party on near-coastal voyages as defined by the party.4. nothing in this regulation shall in any way limit the jurisdiction of any state, whether or not a party to the convention.regulation i/4control procedures1. control exercised by a duly authorized control officer under article x shall be limited to the following:(a) verification in accordance with article x(1) that all seafarers serving on board who are required to be certificated by the convention hold a valid certificate or a valid dispensation;(b) assessment of the ability of the seafarers of the ship to maintain watchkeeping standards as required by the convention if there are grounds for believing that such standards are not being maintained because, while in the port of a party or in the approaches to that port, the following have occurred:(i) the ship has been involved in a collision, grounding or stranding; or(ii) there has been a discharge of substances from the ship when underway, at anchor or at berth which is illegal under international conventions; or(iii) the ship has been manoeuvred in an erratic or unsafe manner or navigational course markers or traffic separation schemes have not been followed.2. the control officer shall provide written information to the master of the ship and the appropriate representative of the flag state according to article x if, as a result of control action taken in accordance with paragraph 1, any of the following deficiencies are revealed:(a) failure of seafarers, required to hold a certificate, to have an appropriate valid certificate or valid dispensation;(b) failure of navigational or engineering watch arrangements to conform to the requirements specified for the ship by the flag state;(c) absence in a watch of a person qualified to operate equipment essential to safe navigation or the prevention of pollution;(d) inability of the master to provide rested persons for the first watch at the commencement of a voyage and subsequent relieving watches.3. failures to correct the deficiencies referred to in paragraph 2(a) - to the extent that they relate to the certificates of the master, chief engineer officer and officers in charge of navigational and engineering watches and, where relevant, the radio officer - and in paragraph 2(b), shall be the only grounds under article x on which a party may detain a ship ARTICLE iimaster - deck departmentregulation ii/1basic principles to be observed in keeping a navigational watch1. parties shall direct the attention of shipowners, ship operators, masters and watchkeeping personnel to the following principles which shall be observed to ensure that a safe navigational watch is maintained at all times.2. the master of every ship is bound to ensure that watchkeeping arrangements are adequate for maintaining a safe navigational watch. under the master's general direction, the officers of the watch are responsible for navigating the ship safely during their periods of duty when they will be particularly concerned with avoiding collision and stranding.3. the basic principles, including but not limited to the following, shall be taken into account on all ships.4. watch arrangements(a) the composition of the watch shall at all times be adequate and appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions and shall take into account the need for maintaining a proper look-out.(b) when deciding the composition of the watch on the bridge which may include appropriate deck ratings, the following factors, inter alia, shall be taken into account:(i) at no time shall the bridge be left unattended;(ii) weather conditions, visibility and whether there is daylight or darkness;(iii) proximity of navigational hazards which may make it necessary for the officer in charge of the watch to carry out additional navigational duties;(iv) use and operational condition of navigational aids such as radar or electronic position-indicating devices and any other equipment affecting the safe navigation of the ship;(v) whether the ship is fitted with automatic steering;(vi) any unusual demands on the navigational watch that may arise as a result of special operational circumstances.5. fitness for dutythe watch system shall be such that the efficiency of watchkeeping officers and watchkeeping ratings is not impaired by fatigue. duties shall be so organized that the first watch at the commencement of a voyage and the subsequent relieving watches are sufficiently rested and otherwise fit for duty.6. navigation(a) the intended voyage shall be planned in advance taking into consideration all pertinent information and any course laid down shall be checked before the voyage commences.(b) during the watch the course steered, position and speed shall be checked at sufficiently frequent intervals, using any available navigational aids necessary, to ensure that the ship follows the planned course.(c) the officer of the watch shall have full knowledge of the location and operation of all safety and navigational equipment on board the ship and shall be aware and take account of the operating limitations of such equipment.(d) the officer in charge of a navigational watch shall not be assigned or undertake any duties which would interfere with the safe navigation of the ship.7. navigational equipment(a) the officer of the watch shall make the most effective use of all navigational equipment at his disposal.(b) when using radar, the officer of the watch shall bear in mind the necessity to comply at all times with the provisions on the use of radar contained in the applicable regulations for preventing collisions at sea.(c) in cases of need the officer of the watch shall not hesitate to use the helm, engines and sound signalling apparatus.8. navigational duties and responsibilities(a) the officer in charge of the watch shall:(i) keep his watch on the bridge which he shall in no circumstances leave until properly relieved;(ii) continue to be responsible for the safe navigation of the ship, despite the presence of the master on the bridge, until the master informs him specifically that he has assumed that responsibility and this is mutually understood;(iii) notify the master when in any doubt as to what action to take in the interest of safety;(iv) not hand over the watch to the relieving officer if he has reason to believe that the latter is obviously not capable of carrying out his duties effectively, in which case he shall notify the master accordingly.(b) on taking over the watch the relieving officer shall satisfy himself as to the ship's estimated or true position and confirm its intended track, course and speed and shall note any dangers to navigation expected to be encountered during his watch.(c) a proper record shall be kept of the movements and activities during the watch relating to the navigation of the ship.9. look-outin addition to maintaining a proper look-out for the purpose of fully appraising the situation and the risk of collision, stranding and other dangers to navigation, the duties of the look-out shall include the detection of ships or aircraft in distress, shipwrecked persons, wrecks and debris. in maintaining a look-out the following shall be observed:(a) the look-out must be able to give full attention to the keeping of a proper look-out and no other duties shall be undertaken or assigned which could interfere with that task;(b) the duties of the look-out and helmsman are separate and the helmsman shall not be considered to be the look-out while steering, except in small ships where an unobstructed all-round view is provided at the steering position and there is no impairment of night vision or other impediment to the keeping of a proper look-out. the officer in charge of the watch may be the sole look-out in daylight provided that on each such occasion:(i) the situation has been carefully assessed and it has been established without doubt that it is safe to do so;(ii) full account has been taken of all relevant factors including, but not limited to:- state of weather- visibility- traffic density- proximity of danger to navigation- the attention necessary when navigating in or near traffic separation schemes;(iii) assistance is immediately available to be summoned to the bridge when any change in the situation so requires.10. navigation with pilot embarkeddespite the duties and obligations of a pilot, his presence on board does not relieve the master or officer in charge of the watch from their duties and obligations for the safety of the ship. the master and the pilot shall exchange information regarding navigation procedures, local conditions and the ship's characteristics. the master and officer of the watch shall co-operate closely with the pilot and maintain an accurate check of the ship's position and movement.11. protection of the marine environmentthe master and officer in charge of the watch shall be aware of the serious effects of operational or accidental pollution of the marine environment and shall take all possible precautions to prevent such pollution, particularly within the framework of relevant international and port regulations.regulation ii/2mandatory minimum requirements for certification of masters and chief mates
