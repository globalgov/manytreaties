AGREEMENT

on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT,

RECALLING the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982,

DETERMINED to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,

RESOLVED to improve cooperation between States to that end,

CALLING for more effective enforcement by flag States, port States and coastal States of the conservation and management measures adopted for such stocks,

SEEKING to address in particular the problems identified in Chapter 17, programme area C, of Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, namely, that the management of high seas fisheries is inadequate in many areas and that some resources are over-utilised; noting that there are problems of unregulated fishing, over-capitalisation, excessive fleet size, vessel reflagging to escape controls, insufficiently selective gear, unreliable databases and lack of sufficient cooperation between States,

COMMITTING themselves to responsible fisheries,

CONSCIOUS of the need to avoid adverse impacts on the marine environment, preserve biodiversity, maintain the integrity of marine ecosystems and minimise the risk of long-term or irreversible effects of fishing operations,

RECOGNISING the need for specific assistance, including financial, scientific and technological assistance, in order that developing States can participate effectively in the conservation, management and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,

CONVINCED that an agreement for the implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention would best serve these purposes and contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security,

AFFIRMING that matters not regulated by the Convention or by this Agreement continue to be governed by the rules and principles of general international law,

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

PART II

CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS

Article 5

General principles

In order to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in giving effect to their duty to cooperate in accordance with the Convention:

(a)

adopt measures to ensure long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and promote the objective of their optimum utilisation;

(b)

ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors, including the special requirements of developing States, and taking into account fishing patterns, the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards, whether subregional, regional or global;

(c)

apply the precautionary approach in accordance with Article 6;

(d)

assess the impacts of fishing, other human activities and environmental factors on target stocks and species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent on the target stocks;

(e)

adopt, where necessary, conservation and management measures for species belonging to the same ecosystem or associated with or dependent on the target stocks, with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened;

(f)

minimise pollution, waste, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, catch of non-target species, both fish and non-fish species, (hereinafter referred to as 'non-target species') and impacts on associated or dependent species, in particular endangered species, through measures including, to the extent practicable, the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques;

(g)

protect biodiversity in the marine environment;

(h)

take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing and excess fishing capacity and to ensure that levels of fishing effort do not exceed those commensurate with the sustainable use of fishery resources;

(i)

take into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers;

(j)

collect and share, in a timely manner, complete and accurate data concerning fishng activities on, inter alia, vessel position, catch of target and non-target species and fishing effort, as set out in Annex I, as well as information from national and international research programmes;

(k)

promote and conduct scientific research and develop appropriate technologies in support of fishery conservation and management, and

(l)

implement and enforce conservation and management measures through effective monitoring, control and surveillance.

Article 6

Application of the precautionary approach

1.   States shall apply the precautionary approach widely to conservation, management and exploitation of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in order to protect the living marine resources and preserve the marine environment.

2.   States shall be more cautions when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.

3.   In implementing the precautionary approach, States shall:

(a)

improve decision-making for fishery resource conservation and management by obtaining and sharing the best scientific information available and implementing improved techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty,

(b)

apply the guidelines set out in Annex II and determine, on the basis of the best scientific information available, stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded;

(c)

take into account, inter alia, uncertainties relating to the size and productivity of the stocks, reference points, stock condition in relation to such reference points, levels and distribution of fishing mortality and the impact of fishing activities on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as existing and predicted oceanic, environmental and socioeconomic conditions, and

(d)

develop data-collection and research programmes to assess the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent species and their environment, and adopt plans which are necessary to ensure the conservation of such species and to protect habitats of special concern.

4.   State shall take measures to ensure that, when reference points are approached, they will not be exeeded. In the event that they are exceeded, States shall, without delay, take the action determined under paragraph 3(b) to restore the stocks.

5.   Where the status of target stocks or non-target or associated or dependent species is of concern, States shall subject such stocks and species to enhanced monitoring in order to review their status and the efficacy of conservation and management measures. They shall revise those measures regularly in the light of new information.

6.   For new or exploratory fisheries, States shall adopt as soon as possible cautious conservation and management measures, including, inter alia, catch limits and effort limits. Such measures shall remain in force until there are sufficient data to allow assessment of the impact of the fisheries on the long-term sustainability of the stocks, whereupon conservation and management measures based on that assessment shall be implemented. The latter measures shall, if appropriate, allow for the gradual development of the fisheries.

7.   If a natural phenomenon has a significant adverse impact on the status of straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States shall adopt conservation and management measures on an emergency basis to ensure that fishing activity does not exacerbate such adverse impact. States shall also adopt such measures on an emergency basis where fishing activity presents a serious threat to the sustainability of such stocks. Measures taken on an emergency basis shall be temporary and shall be based on the best scientific evidence available.

Article 7

Compatibility of conservation and management measures

1.   Without prejudice to the sovereign rights of coastal States for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living marine resources within areas under national jurisdiction as provided for in the Convention, and the right of all States for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas in accordance with the Convention:

(a)

with respect to straddling fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and the States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the adjacent high seas area shall seek, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, to agree upon the measures necessary for the conservation of these stocks in the adjacent high seas area;

(b)

with respect to highly migratory fish stocks, the relevant coastal States and other States whose nationals fish for such stocks in the region shall cooperate, either directly or through the appropriate mechanisms for cooperation provided for in Part III, with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilisation of such stocks throughout the region, both within and beyond the areas under national jurisdiction.

2.   Conservation and management measures established for the high seas and those adopted for areas under national jurisdiction shall be compatible in order to ensure conservation and management of the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in their entirety. To this end, coastal States and States fishing on the high seas have a duty to cooperate for the purpose of achieving compatible measures in respect of such stocks. In determining compatible conservation and management measures, States shall:

(a)

take into account the conservation and management measures adopted and applied in accordance with Article 61 of the Convention in respect of the same stocks by coastal States within areas under national jurisdiction and ensure that measures established in respect of such stocks for the high seas do not undermine the effectiveness of such measures;

(b)

take into account previously agreed measures established and applied for the high seas in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas;

(c)

take into account previously agreed measures established and applied in accordance with the Convention in respect of the same stocks by a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement;

(d)

take into account the biological unity and other biological characteristics of the stocks and the relationships between the distribution of the stocks, the fisheries and the geographical particularities of the region concerned, including the extent to which the stocks occur and are fished in areas under national jurisdiction;

(e)

take into account the respective dependence of the coastal States and the States fishing on the high seas on the stocks concerned, and

(f)

ensure that such measures do not result in harmful impact on the living marine resources as a whole.

3.   In giving effect to their duty to cooperate, States shall make every effort to agree on compatible conservation and management measures within a reasonable period of time.

4.   If no agreement can be reached within a reasonable period of time, any of the States concerned may invoke the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.

5.   Pending agreement on compatible conservation and management measures, the States concerned, in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature. In the event that they are unable to agree on such arrangements, any of the States concerned may, for the purpose of obtaining provisional measures, submit the dispute to a court or tribunal in accordance with the procedures for the settlement of disputes provided for in Part VIII.

6.   Provisional arrangements or measures entered into or prescribed pursuant to paragraph 5 shall take into account the provisions of this Part, shall have due regard to the rights and obligations of all States concerned, shall not jeopardize or hamper the reaching of final agreement on compatible conservation and management measures and shall be without prejudice to the final outcome of any dispute settlement procedure.

7.   Coastal States shall regularly inform States fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks within areas under their national jurisdiction.

8.   States fishing on the high seas shall regularly inform other interested States, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, or through other appropriate means, of the measures they have adopted for regulating the activities of vessels flying their flag which fish for such stocks on the high seas.

PART III

MECHANISMS FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION CONCERNING STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS

Article 8

Coastal States and States fishing on the high seas shall, in accordance with the Convention, pursue cooperation in relation to straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, taking into account the specific characteristics of the subregion or region, to ensure effective conservation and management of such stocks.

2.   States shall enter into consultations in good faith and without delay, particularly where there is evidence that the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks concerned may be under threat of overexploitation or where a new fishery is being developed for such stocks. To this end, consultations may be initiated at the request of any interested State with a view to establishing appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of the stocks. Pending agreement on such arrangements, States shall observe the provisions of this Agreement and shall act in good faith and with due regard to the rights, interests and duties of other States.

3.   Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement has the competence to establish conservation and management measures for particular straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks, States fishing for the stocks on the high seas and relevant coastal States shall give effect to their duty to cooperate by becoming members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement, or by agreeing to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organisation or arrangement. States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned may become members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement. The terms of participation in such organisation or arrangement shall not preclude such States from membership or participation; nor shall they be applied in a manner which discriminates against any State or group of States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned.

4.   Only those States which are members of such an organisation or participants in such an arrangement, or which agree to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organisation or arrangement, shall have access to the fishery resources to which those measures apply.

5.   Where there is no subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement to establish conservation and management measures for a particular straddling fish stock or highly migratory fish stock, relevant coastal States and States fishing on the high seas for such stock in the subregion or region shall cooperate to establish such an organisation or enter into other appropriate arrangements to ensure conservation and management of such stock and shall participate in the work of the organisation or arrangement.

6.   Any State intending to propose that action be taken by an intergovernmental organisation having competence with respect to living resources should, where such action would have a significant effect on conservation and management measures already established by a competent subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, consult through that organisation or arrangement with its members or participants. To the extent practicable, such consultation should take place prior to the submission of the proposal to the intergovernmental organisation.

Article 9

(a)

enforce such measures irrespective of where violations occur,

(b)

investigate immediately and fully any alleged violation of subregional or regional conservation and management measures, which may include the physical inspection of the vessels concerned, and report promptly to the State alleging the violation and the relevant subregional or regional organisation or arrangements on the progress and outcome of the investigation;

(c)

require any vessel flying its flag to give information to the investigating authority regarding vessel position, catches, fishing gear, fishing operations and related activities in the area of an alleged violation;

(d)

if satisfied that sufficient evidence is available in respect of an alleged violation, refer the case to its authorities with a view to instituting proceedings without delay in accordance with its laws and, where appropriate, detain the vessel concerned;

(e)

ensure that, where it has been established, in accordance with its laws, a vessel has been involved in the commission of a serious violation of such measures, the vessel does not engage in fishing operations on the high seas until such time as all outstanding sanctions imposed by the flag State in respect of the violation have been complied with.

2.   All investigations and judicial proceedings shall be carried out expeditiously. Sanctions applicable in respect of violations shall be adequate in severity to be effective in securing compliance and to discourage violations wherever they occur and shall deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities. Measures applicable in respect of masters and other officers of fishing vessels shall include provisions which may permit, inter alia, refusal, withdrawal or suspension of authorisations to serve as masters or officers on such vessels.

Article 20

International cooperation in enforcement

1.   States shall cooperate, either directly or through subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, to ensure compliance with and enforcement of subregional and regional conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.

2.   A flag State conducting an investigation of an alleged violation of conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks may request the assistance of any other State whose cooperation may be useful in the conduct of that investigation. All States shall endeavour to meet reasonable requests made by a flag State in connection with such investigations.

3.   A flag State may undertake such investigations directly, in cooperation with other interested States or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement. Information on the progress and outcome of the investigations shall be provided to all States having an interest in, or affected by, the alleged violation.

4.   States shall assist each other in identifying vessels reported to have engaged in activities undermining the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures.

5.   States shall, to the extent permitted by national laws and regulations, establish arrangements for making available to prosecuting authorities in other States evidence relating to alleged violations of such measures.

6.   Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a vessel on the high seas has been engaged in unauthorised fishing within an area under the jurisdiction of a coastal State, the flag State of that vessel, at the request of the coastal State concerned, shall immediately and fully investigate the matter. The flag State shall cooperate with the coastal State in taking appropriate enforcement action in such cases and may authorise the relevant authorities of the coastal State to board and inspect the vessel on the high seas. This paragraph is without prejudice to Article 111 of the Convention.

7.   States Parties which are members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement may take action in accordance with international law, including through recourse to subregional or regional procedures established for this purpose, to deter vessels which have engaged in activities which undermine the effectiveness of or otherwise violate the conservation and management measures established by that organisation or arrangement from fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region until such time as appropriate action is taken by the flag State.

Article 21

Subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement

1.   In any high seas area covered by a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, a State Party which is a member of such organisation or a participant in such arrangement may, through its duly authorised inspectors, board and inspect, in accordance with paragraph 2, fishing vessels flying the flag of another State Party to this Agreement, whether or not such State Party is also a member of the organisation or a participant in the arrangement, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks established by that organisation or arrangement.

2.   States shall establish, through subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as procedures to implement other provisions of this Article. Such procedures shall be consistent with this Article and the basic procedures set out in Article 22 and shall not discriminate against non-members of the organisation or non-participants in the arrangement. Boarding and inspection as well as any subsequent enforcement action shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures. States shall give due publicity to procedures established pursuant to this paragraph.

3.   If, within two years of the adoption of this Agreement, any organisation or arrangement has not established such procedures, boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as any subsequent enforcement action, shall, pending the establishment of such procedures, be conducted in accordance with this Article and the basic procedures set out in Article 22.

4.   Prior to taking action under this Article, inspecting States shall, either directly or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, inform all States whose vessels fish on the high seas in the subregion or region of the form of identification issued to their duly authorised inspectors. The vessels used for boarding and inspection shall be clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service. At the time of becoming a Party to this Agreement, a State shall designate an appropriate authority to receive notifications pursuant to this Article and shall give due publicity of such designation through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement.

5.   Where, following a boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has engaged in any activity contrary to the conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1, the inspecting State shall, where appropriate, secure evidence and shall promptly notify the flag State of the alleged violation.

6.   The flag State shall respond to the notification referred to in paragraph 5 within three working days of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2, and shall either:

(a)

fulfil, without delay, its obligations under Article 19 to investigate and, if evidence so warrants, take enforcement action with respect to the vessel, in which case it shall promptly inform the inspecting State of the results of the investigation and of any enforcement action taken; or

(b)

authorise the inspecting State to investigate.

7.   Where the flag State authorises the inspecting State to investigate an alleged violation, the inspecting State shall, without delay, communicate the results of that investigation to the flag State. The flag State shall, if evidence so warrants, fulfil its obligations to take enforcement action with respect to the vessel. Alternatively, the flag State may authorise the inspecting State to take such enforcement action as the flag State may specify with respect to the vessel, consistent with the rights and obligations of the flag State under this Agreement.

8.   Where, following boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a serious violation, and the flag State has either failed to respond or failed to take action as required under paragraphs 6 or 7, the inspectors may remain on board and secure evidence and may require the master to assist in further investigation including, where appropriate, by bringing the vessel without delay to the nearest appropriate port, or to such other port as may be specified in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2. The inspecting State shall immediately inform the flag State of the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The inspecting State and the flag State and, as appropriate, the port State shall take all necessary steps to ensure the well-being of the crew regardless of their nationality.

9.   The inspecting State shall inform the flag State and the relevant organisation or the participants in the relevant arrangement of the results of any further investigation.

10.   The inspecting State shall require its inspectors to observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel and the crew, minimise interference with fishing operations and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. The inspecting State shall ensure that boarding and inspection is not conducted in a manner that would constitute harassment of any fishing vessel.

11.   For the purposes of this Article, a serious violation means:

(a)

fishing without a valid licence, authorisation or permit issued by the flag State in accordance with Article 18(3Xa);

(b)

failing to maintain accurate records of catch and catch-related data, as required by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, or serious misreporting of catch, contrary to the catch reporting requirements of such organisation or arrangement;

(c)

fishing in a closed area, fishing during a closed season or fishing without, or after attainment of, a quota established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement;

(d)

directed fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;

(e)

using prohibited fishing gear,

(f)

falsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;

(g)

concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;

(h)

multiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures; or

(i)

such other violations as may be specified in procedures established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement.

12.   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, the flag State may, at any time, take action to fulfil its obligations under Article 19 with respect to an alleged violation. Where the vessel is under the direction of the inspecting State, the inspecting State shall, at the request of the flag State, release the vessel to the flag State along with full information on the progress and outcome of its investigation.

13.   This Article is without prejudice to the right of the flag State to take any measures, including proceedings to impose penalties, according to its laws.

14.   This Article applies mutatis mutandis to boarding and inspection by a State Party which is a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement and which has clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel flying the flag of another State Party has engaged in any activity contrary to relevant conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1 in the high seas area covered by such organisation or arrangement, and such vessel has subsequently, during the same fishing trip, entered into an area under the national jurisdiction of the inspecting State.

15.   Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement has established an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligation under this Agreement of its members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by the organisation or arrangement, members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement may agree to limit the application of paragraph 1 as between themselves in respect of the conservation and management measures which have been established in the relevant high seas area.

16.   Action taken by States other than the flag State in respect of vessels having engaged in activities contrary to subregional or regional conservation and management measures shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.

17.   Where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a fishing vessel on the high seas is without nationality, a State may board and inspect the vessel. Where evidence so warrants, the State may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law.

18.   States shall be liable for damage or loss attributable to them arising from action taken pursuant to this Article when such action is unlawful or exceeds that reasonably required in the light of available information to implement the provisions of this Article.

Article 22

Basic procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to Article 21

1.   The inspecting State shall ensure that its duly authorised inspectors:

(a)

present credentials to the master of the vessel and produce a copy of the text of the relevant conservation and management measures or rules and regulations in force in the high seas area in question, pursuant to those measures;

(b)

initiate notice to the flag State at the time of the boarding and inspection;

(c)

do not interfere with the master's ability to communicate with the authorities of the flag State during the boarding and inspection;

(d)

provide a copy of a report on the boarding and inspection to the master and to the authorities of the flag State, noting therein any objection or statement which the master wishes to have included in the report;

(e)

promptly leave the vessel following completion of the inspection if they find no evidence of a serious violation; and

(f)

avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances.

2.   The duly authorised inspectors of an inspecting State shall have the authority to inspect the vessel, its licence, gear, equipment, records, facilities, fish and fish products and any relevant documents necessary to verify compliance with the relevant conservation and management measures.

3.   The flag State shall ensure that vessel masters:

(a)

accept and facilitate prompt and safe boarding by the inspectors;

(b)

cooperate with and assist in the inspection of the vessel conducted pursuant to these procedures;

(c)

do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the inspectors in the performance of their duties;

(d)

allow the inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag State and the inspecting State during the boarding and inspection;

(e)

provide reasonable facilities, including, where appropriate, food and accommodation, to the inspectors;

(f)

facilitate safe disembarkation by the inspectors.

4.   In the event that the master of a vessel refuses to accept boarding and inspection in accordance with this Article and Article 21, the flag State shall, except in circumstances where, in accordance with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to safety at sea, it is necessary to delay the boarding and inspection, direct the master of the vessel to submit immediately to boarding and inspection and, if the master does not comply with such direction, shall suspend the vessel's authorisation to fish and order the vessel to return immediately to port. The flag State shall advise the inspecting State of the action it has taken when the circumstances referred to in this paragraph arise.

Article 23

Measures taken by a port State

1.   A port State has the right and the duty to take measures, in accordance with international law, to promote the effectiveness of subregional, regional and global conservation and management measures. When taking such measures a port State shall not discriminate in form or in fact against the vessels of any State.

2.   A port State may, inter alia, inspect documents, fishing gear and catch on board fishing vessels, when such vessels are voluntarily in its ports or at its offshore terminals.

3.   States may adopt regulations empowering the relevant national authorities to prohibit landings and transhipments where it has been established that the catch has been taken in a manner which undermines the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures on the high seas.

4.   Nothing in this Article affects the exercise by States of their sovereignty over ports in their territory in accordance with international law.

PART VII

Annex I

STANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COLLECTION AND SHARING OF DATA

Article 1

General principles

1.   The timely collection, compilation and analysis of data are fundamental to the effective conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. To this end, data from fisheries for these stocks on the high seas and those in areas under national jurisdiction are required and should be collected and compiled in such a way as to enable statistically meaningful analysis for the purposes of fishery resource conservation and management. These data include catch and fishing effort statistics and other fishery-related information, such as vessel-related and other data for standardising fishing effort. Data collected should also include information on non-target and associated or dependent species. All data should be verified to ensure accuracy. Confidentiality of non-aggregated data shall be maintained. The dissemination of such data shall be subject to the terms on which they have been provided.

2.   Assistance, including training as well as financial and technical assistance, shall be provided to developing States in order to build capacity in the field of conservation and management of living marine resources. Assistance should focus on enhancing capacity to implement data collection and verification, observer programmes, data analysis and research projects supporting stock assessments. The fullest possible involvement of developing State scientists and managers in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks should be promoted.

Article 2

Principles of data collection, compilation and exchange

The following general principles should be considered in defining the parameters for collection, compilation and exchange of data from fishing operations for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks:

(a)

States should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method (e.g., each individual tow for trawl, each set for long-line and purse-seine, each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment;

(b)

States should ensure that fishery data are verified through an appropriate system;

(c)

States should compile fishery-related and other supporting scientific data and provide them in an agreed format and in a timely manner to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement where one exists. Otherwise, States should cooperate to exchange data either directly or through such other cooperative mechanisms as may be agreed among them;

(d)

States should agree, within the framework of subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, or otherwise, on the specification of data and the format in which they are to be provided, in accordance with this Annex and taking into account the nature of the stocks and the fisheries for those stocks in the region. Such organisations or arrangements should request non-members or non-participants to provide data concerning relevant fishing activities by vessels flying their flag;

(e)

such organisations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organisation or arrangement; and

(f)

scientists of the flag State and from the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement should analyse the data separately or jointly, as appropriate.

Article 3

Basic fishery data

1.   States shall collect and make available to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement the following types of data in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment in accordance with agreed procedures:

(a)

time series of catch and effort statistics by fishery and fleet;

(b)

total catch in number, nominal weight, or both, by species (both target and non-target) as is appropriate to each fishery. (Nominal weight is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations as the live-weight equivalent of the landings);

(c)

discard statistics, including estimates where necessary, reported as number or nominal weight by species, as is appropriate to each fishery;

(d)

effort statistics appropriate to each fishing method;

(e)

fishing location, date and time fished and other statistics on fishing operations as appropriate.

2.   States shall also collect where appropriate and provide to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement information to support stock assessment, including:

(a)

composition of the catch according to length, weight and sex;

(b)

other biological information supporting stock assessments, such as information on age, growth, recruitment, distribution and stock identity;

(c)

other relevant research, including surveys of abundance, biomass surveys, hydro-acoustic surveys, research on environmental factors affecting stock abundance, and oceanographic and ecological studies.

Article 4

Vessel data and information

1.   States should collect the following types of vessel-related data for standardising fleet composition and vessel fishing power and for converting between different measures of effort in the analysis of catch and effort data:

(a)

vessel identification, flag and port of registry;

(b)

vessel type;

(c)

vessel specifications (e.g., material of construction, date built, registered length, gross registered tonnage, power of main engines, hold capacity and catch storage methods);

(d)

fishing gear description (e.g., types, gear specifications and quantity).

2.   The flag State will collect the following information:

(a)

navigation and position fixing aids;

(b)

communication equipment and international radio call sign;

(c)

crew size.

Article 5

Reporting

A State shall ensure that vessels flying its flag sends to its national fisheries administration and, where agreed, to the relevant sub regional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, logbook-data on catch and effort, including data on fishing operations on the high seas, at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations. Such data shall be transmitted, where necessary, by radio, telex, fax or satellite transmission or by other means.

Article 6

Data verification

States or, as appropriate, subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements should establish mechanisms for verifying fishery data, such as:

(a)

position verification through vessel monitoring systems;

(b)

scientific observer programmes to monitor catch, effort, catch composition (target and non-target) and other details of fishing operations;

(c)

vessel trip, landing and transshipment reports;

(d)

port sampling.

Article 7

Data exchange

1.   Data collected by flag States must be shared with other flag States and relevant coastal States through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements. Such organisations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested States under the terms and conditions established by the organisation or arrangement, while maintaining confidentiality of non-aggregated data, and should, to the extent feasible, develop database systems which provide efficient access to data.

2.   At the global level, collection and dissemination of data should be effected through the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement does not exist, that organization may also do the same at the subregional or regional level by arrangement with the States concerned.

Annex II

GUIDELINES FOR THE APPLICATION OF PRECAUTIONARY REFERENCE POINTS IN CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF STRADDLING FISH STOCKS AND HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS

1.

A precautionary reference point is an estimated value derived through an agreed scientific procedure, which corresponds to the state of the resource and of the fishery, and which can be used as a guide for fisheries management.

2.

Two types of precautionary reference points should be used: conservation, or limit, reference points and management, or target, reference points. Limit reference points set boundaries which are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits within which the stocks can produce maximum sustainable yield. Target reference points are intended to meet management objectives.

3.

Precautionary reference points should be stock-specific to account, inter alia, for the reproductive capacity, the resilience of each stock and the characteristics of fisheries exploiting the stock, as well as other sources of mortality and major sources of uncertainty.

4.

Management strategies shall seek to maintain or restore populations of harvested stocks, and where necessary associated or dependent species, at levels consistent with previously agreed precautionary reference points. Such reference points shall be used to trigger pre-agreed conservation and management action. Management strategies shall include measures which can be implemented when precautionary reference points are approached.

5.

Fishery management strategies shall ensure that the risk of exceeding limit reference points is very low. If a stock falls below a limit reference point or is at risk of falling below such a reference point, conservation and management action should be initiated to facilitate stock recovery. Fishery management strategies shall ensure that target reference points are not exceeded on average.

6.

When information for determining reference points for a fishery is poor or absent, provisional reference points shall be set. Provisional reference points may be established by analogy to similar and better-known stocks. In such situations, the fishery shall be subject to enhanced monitoring so as to enable revision of provisional reference points as improved information becomes available.

7.

The fishing mortality rate which generates maximum sustainable yield should be regarded as a minimum standard for limit reference points. For stocks which are not overfished, fishery management strategies shall ensure that fishing mortality does not exceed that which corresponds to maximum sustainable yield, and that the biomass does not fall below a predefined threshold. For overfished stocks, the biomass which would produce maximum sustainable yield can serve as a rebuilding target.

ANNEX B

Declaration concerning the competence of the European Community with regard to matters governed by the Agreement on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks

(Declaration made pursuant to Article 47 of the Agreement)

1.

Article 47(1) of the Agreement on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks provides that in cases where an international organisation referred to in Annex IX, Article 1, of the Convention does not have competence over all the matters governed by the Agreement, Annex IX of the Convention (with the exception of Article 2, first sentence, and Article 3(1)) shall apply mutatis mutandis to participation by such international organisation in the Agreement.

2.

The current members of the Community are the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Portuguese Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

3.

The Agreement on the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks shall apply, with regard to the competences transferred to the European Community, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty, in particular Article 227 thereof.

4.

This declaration is not applicable in the case of the territories of the Member States in which the said Treaty does not apply and is without prejudice to such acts or positions as may be adopted under the Agreement by the Member States concerned on behalf of and in the interests of those territories.

I.   MATTERS FOR WHICH THE COMMUNITY HAS EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCE

5.

The Community points out that its Member States have transferred competence to it with regard to the conservation and management of living marine resources. Hence, in this field, it is for the Community to adopt the relevant rules and regulations (which the Member States enforce) and within its competence to enter into external undertakings with third States or competent organisations.

This competence applies in regard of waters under national fisheries jurisdiction and to the high seas.

6.

The Community enjoys the regulatory competence granted under international law to the flag State of a vessel to determine the conservation and management measures for marine fisheries resources applicable to vessels flying the flag of Member States and to ensure that Member States adopt provisions allowing for the implementation of the said measures.

7.

Nevertheless, measures applicable in respect of masters and other officers of fishing vessels, for example refusal, withdrawal or suspension of authorisations to serve as such, are within the competence of the Member States in accordance with their national legislation.

Measures relating to the exercise of jurisdiction by the flag State over its vessels on the high seas, in particular provisions such as those related to the taking and relinquishing of control of fishing vessels by States other than the flag State, international cooperation in respect of enforcement and the recovery of the control of their vessels, are within the competence of the Member States in compliance with Community law.

II.   MATTERS FOR WHICH BOTH THE COMMUNITY AND ITS MEMBER STATES HAVE COMPETENCE

8.

The Community shares competence with its Member States on the following matters governed by this Agreement: requirements of developing States, scientific research, port-State measures and measures adopted in respect of non-members of regional fisheries organisations and non-Parties to the Agreement.

The following provisions of the Agreement apply both to the Community and to its Member States:

-

general provisions: (Articles 1, 4 and 34 to 50),

-

dispute settlement: (Part VIII).

ANNEX C

Interpretative declarations to be deposited by the Community and its Member States on ratification of the Agreement

1.

The European Community and its Member States understand that the terms 'geographical particularities', 'specific characteristics of the sub-region or region', 'socioeconomic geographical and environmental factors', 'natural characteristics of that sea' or any other similar terms employed in reference to a geographical region do not prejudice the rights and duties of States under international law.

2.

The European Community and its Member States understand that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted in such a way as to conflict with the principle of freedom of the high seas, recognised by international law.

3.

The European Community and its Member States understand that the term 'States whose nationals fish on the high seas' shall not provide any new grounds for jurisdiction based on the nationality of persons involved in fishing on the high seas rather than on the principle of flag State jurisdiction.

4.

The Agreement does not grant any State the right to maintain or apply unilateral measures during the transitional period as referred to in Article 21(3). Thereafter, if no agreement has been reached, States shall act only in accordance with the provisions provided for in Articles 21 and 22 of the Agreement.

5.

Regarding the application of Article 21, the European Community and its Member States understand that, when a flag State declares that it intends to exercise its authority, in accordance with the provisions in Article 19, over a fishing vessel flying its flag, the authorities of the inspecting State shall not purport to exercise any further authority under the provisions of Article 21 over such a vessel.

Any dispute related to this issue shall be settled in accordance with the procedures provided for in Part VIII of the Agreement. No State may invoke this type of dispute to remain in control of a vessel which does not fly its flag.

In addition, the European Community and its Member States consider that the word 'unlawful' in Article 21(18) of the Agreement should be interpreted in the light of the whole Agreement, and in particular, Articles 4 and 35 thereof.

6.

The European Community and its Member States reiterate that all States shall refrain in their relations from the threat or use of force in accordance with general principles of international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

In addition, the European Community and its Member States underline that the use of force as referred to in Article 22 constitutes an exceptional measure which must be based on the strictest compliance with the principle of proportionality and that any abuse thereof shall imply the international liability of the inspecting State. Any case of non-compliance shall be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the applicable dispute-settlement procedures.

Furthermore, the European Community and its Member States consider that the relevant terms and conditions for boarding and inspection should be further elaborated in accordance with the relevant principles of international law in the framework of the appropriate regional and subregional fisheries management organisations and arrangements.

7.

The European Community and its Member States understand that in the application of the provisions of Article 21(6), (7) and (8), the flag State may rely on the requirements of its legal system under which the prosecuting authorities enjoy a discretion to decide whether or not to prosecute in the light of all the facts of a case. Decisions of the flag State based on such requirements shall not be interpreted as failure to respond or to take action.
