should be established on french territory at:epinal on the moselle,damelevieres on the meurthe,custines on the moselle,metz on the moselle,uckange on the moselle,wittring on the saar,and that a retransmission post should be established in the apache flood gate building ARTICLE 2the costs of construction, renovation, alterations, large-scale repairs, maintenance, operation servicing and any water rates and all other costs incurred to ensure the proper functioning of the stations shall be allocated as follows:the government of the french republic shall defray the costs of:public works at
