ARTICLE 2.16: RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WTO COMMITTEE ON ANTI-DUMPING PRACTICES

ARTICLE 2.17: LESSER DUTY RULE

initiate an investigation in an exceptional case, provided that the authority is satisfied, on the
basis of evidence available with it, that dumping or injury has recurred as a result of withdrawal

threat thereof to the domestic industry as a consequence of such dumped imports from the
exporting Party.
12
ARTICLE 2.20: SUBSIDIES

Section B-2: Safeguard Measures
ARTICLE 2.21: DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of Section B-2:
domestic industry means the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive goods
operating in the territory of a Party, or those whose collective output of the like or directly
competitive goods constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of those goods;
serious injury means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry;
threat of serious injury means serious injury that, on the basis of facts and not merely on
allegation, conjecture or remote possibility, is clearly imminent; and
transition period means a period for a good from the date of entry into force of this Agreement
until ten years from the date of completion of tariff elimination or completion of tariff reduction,
as the case may be for each good.
ARTICLE 2.22: BILATERAL SAFEGUARD MEASURES
During the transition period only, if as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty3
under this Agreement, an originating good of the other Party is being imported into the territory
of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and
under such conditions that the imports of such good from the other Party alone4
constitute a
substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to domestic industry producing a like or
directly competitive good, the Party may:

3 A determination that an originating good is being imported as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs
duty provided for under this Agreement shall be made only if such reduction or elimination is a cause which
contributes significantly to the increase in imports, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause. The
passage of a period of time between the commencement or termination of such reduction or elimination and the
increase in imports shall not by itself preclude the determination referred to in this footnote. If the increase in imports
is demonstrably unrelated to such reduction or elimination, the determination referred to in this footnote shall not be
made.
4
For the purposes of certainty, the Parties understand that a Party is not prevented from initiating a bilateral
safeguard investigation in the event of a surge of imports from the territory of non-Parties. For further certainty, the
Parties understand that bilateral safeguard measures can only be imposed on the good of the other Party when the
increase in the import of such goods from that other Party alone constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or
threat of serious injury, to domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good.
13
(a) suspend further reduction of any rate of customs duty on the good provided for
under this Agreement; or
(b) increase the rate of customs duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of:
(i) the MFN applied rate of customs duty on the good in effect at the time the
measure is taken; and

immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

Article 2.22:
(a) a Party shall immediately deliver written notice to the other Party upon:

thereof and the reasons for it;
(ii) making a finding of serious injury or threat thereof caused by increased
imports; and

proposed measure, proposed date of introduction and expected duration;
(c) a Party proposing to apply a safeguard measure shall provide adequate opportunity
for prior consultations with the other Party as far in advance of taking any such
measure as practicable, with a view to reviewing the information arising from the
investigation, exchanging views on the measure and reaching an agreement on the
compensation set out in Article 2.25. The Parties shall in such consultations,

(i) compliance with Section B-2;
(ii) whether any proposed measure should be taken; and
(iii) the appropriateness of the proposed measure, including consideration of
alternative measures; 
14
(d) a Party shall apply a measure only following an investigation by its competent

comply with the requirements of Articles 4.2(a) and (b) of the Safeguards
Agreement, and to this end, Articles 4.2(a) and (b) are incorporated into and made
a part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis;

the period may be extended by up to additional two years, to a total of four
years from the date of first imposition of the measure if the investigating
authorities determine in conformity with procedures set out in
subparagraphs (a) through (f), that the safeguard measure continues to be
necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment
and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting;
(h) no bilateral safeguard measure shall be taken against a particular good while a
global safeguard measure in respect of that good is in place; in the event that a
global safeguard measure is taken in respect of a particular good, any existing
bilateral safeguard measure which is taken against that good shall be terminated;
(i) upon the termination of the safeguard measure, the rate of customs duty shall be
the rate which would have been in effect but for the measure; and
(j) no measures shall be applied again to the import of a good which has previously
been subject to such a measure for a period of time equal to that during which
such measure had been previously applied, provided that the period of nonapplication is at least two years.

ARTICLE 2.24: PROVISIONAL MEASURES
In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a
Party may take a measure described in Article 2.22 on a provisional basis pursuant to a
preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports from the other Party have
increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement,
and such imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic
industry. The duration of such provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time
the requirements of Articles 2.23(d) and (e) shall be met. Any tariff increases shall be promptly
refunded if the investigation provided for in Article 2.23(d) does not result in a finding that the
requirements of Article 2.22 are met. The duration of any provisional measure shall be counted
as part of the period described in Article 2.23(g) (ii).
ARTICLE 2.25: COMPENSATION
1. The Party proposing to apply a measure described in Article 2.22 shall provide to the
other Party mutually agreed adequate means of trade liberalising compensation in the form of
concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the
additional duties expected to result from the measure. If the Parties are unable to agree on
compensation within 30 days in the consultations under Article 2.23(c), the Party against whose
originating goods the measure is applied may take action having trade effects substantially
equivalent to the measure applied under this Article. This action shall be applied only for the
minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects.
2. The right to take action referred to in the second sentence of paragraph 1 shall not be
exercised for:
(a) the first two years that the measure is in effect; and
(b) the first three years that the measure is in effect where it has been extended
beyond two years in accordance with Article 2.23(g) (ii);
provided that the measure described in Article 2.22 has been taken as a result of an absolute
increase in imports and that such a measure conforms to the provisions of this Section.
ARTICLE 2.26: ADMINISTRATION OF EMERGENCY ACTION PROCEEDINGS
1. Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and reasonable administration of its laws,
regulations, decisions and rulings governing all safeguard investigation proceedings.
2. Each Party shall entrust determinations of serious injury or threat thereof in safeguard
investigation proceedings to a competent investigating authority, subject to review by judicial or
administrative tribunals, to the extent provided for in its laws. Negative injury determinations
shall not be subject to modification, except by such review.

3. Each Party shall adopt or maintain equitable, timely, transparent and effective procedures
for safeguard investigation proceedings.
ARTICLE 2.27: GLOBAL SAFEGUARD MEASURES
Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards
Agreement. This Agreement does not confer any additional rights or impose any additional
obligations on the Parties with regard to measures taken pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994
and the Safeguards Agreement, except that a Party taking a safeguard measure under Article XIX
of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement may, to the extent consistent with the obligations
under the WTO Agreement, exclude imports of an originating good of the other Party if such
imports are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof.
Section C: Technical Regulations and SPS Measures
ARTICLE 2.28: TECHNICAL REGULATIONS AND SPS MEASURES
1. Each Party reaffirms its rights and obligations under the TBT Agreement and the SPS
Agreement.
2. For exchange of information, bilateral consultation, and mutual cooperation to facilitate
bilateral trade, while respecting each other’s legitimate rights to adopt measures to protect
human, animal and plant life or health, both Parties shall:
(a) in respect of TBT matters:
(i) exchange information on technical regulations, standards and conformity
assessment procedures in the Parties;
(ii) address any TBT issues to identify a practical solution with a view to
facilitating bilateral trade;
(iii) explore developing possible mutual recognition agreements or
arrangements on technical regulations, standards and conformity
assessment procedures between the Parties for mutual benefit and
facilitating access to each other’s market;
(iv) undertake consultation no later than one year from the date of entry into
force of this Agreement with a view to arriving at mutual recognition
agreements or arrangements for conformity assessment of the sectors listed
in Annex 2-B within three years after the start of the consultation. The
aforementioned period of consultation may be extended, as necessary. Any
legitimate delay or failure to reach and conclude agreements or
arrangements, including on the basis of science and risk-based assessment,
shall not be regarded as a breach of a Party’s obligations under this 
17
subparagraph. The Parties may undertake a joint study through their
technical bodies, as necessary, before starting aforementioned consultation.
In this case, the time-frame of the consultation may be modified
accordingly. The Parties may, after mutual consultation, agree to include
more sectors in Annex 2-B;

international standards, guidelines and recommendations, on specific
issues that may arise from the application of SPS measures, including

prevalence as per the relevant provisions of the SPS Agreement. These
shall be done in terms of the exporting Party objectively demonstrating to
the importing Party that its measures achieve the importing Party’s
appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection and that the
concerned areas are, and are likely to remain, pest- or disease-free areas or
areas of low pest or disease prevalence, respectively. Reasonable access
shall be given, upon request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing
and other relevant procedures;

of the good to voluntarily obtain and supply written information provided by the exporter or

the information, or as a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment.

(b) in the territory of a Party by a person of that Party to a person of the other Party
(consumption abroad);
(c) by a service supplier of a Party, through commercial presence in the territory of
the other Party (commercial presence); or
(d) by a service supplier of a Party, through presence of natural persons of a Party in
the territory of the other Party (presence of natural persons).
ARTICLE 6.2: SCOPE AND COVERAGE
1. This Chapter applies to measures by a Party affecting trade in services.
2. For the purposes of this Chapter, measures adopted or maintained by a Party mean
measures adopted or maintained by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or
by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of any regulatory, administrative or other
governmental authority delegated by central, regional or local governments and authorities.

2 Where the service is not supplied directly by a juridical person but through other forms of commercial presence
such as a branch or a representative office, the service supplier (i.e. the juridical person) shall, nonetheless, through
such presence be accorded the treatment provided for service suppliers under this Chapter. Such treatment shall be
extended to the presence through which the service is supplied and need not be extended to any other parts of the
supplier located outside the territory where the service is supplied. The Parties understand that ‘seeks to provide’ or
‘provides a service’ has the same meaning as ‘supplies a service’ as used in Article XXVIII(g) of GATS.
80
3. This Chapter does not apply to:
(a) government procurement;
(b) subsidies or grants, including government-supported loans, guarantees and
insurance; or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued receipt of such subsidies
or grants, whether or not such subsidies or grants are offered exclusively to domestic
services, service consumers or service suppliers;
(c) services provided in the exercise of governmental authority, provided that such
services are supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more
service providers; and
(d) transportation and non-transportation air services, including domestic and
international services, whether scheduled or non-scheduled, and related services in support of
air services3
other than:
(i) aircraft repair and maintenance services;
(ii) the selling and marketing of air transport services; and
(iii) computer reservation system services.
4. This Chapter shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the
employment market of a Party, nor shall it apply to measures regarding citizenship, residence
or employment on a permanent basis.
5. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry
of natural persons of the other Party into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including
those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of
natural persons across its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such a
manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to the other Party under the terms of this
Chapter as well as the terms of specific commitments undertaken.
6. New services, including new financial services, shall be considered for possible
incorporation into this Chapter at future reviews held in accordance with Article 6.19, or at
the request of either Party immediately. The supply of services which are not technically or
technologically feasible when this Agreement comes into force shall, when they become
feasible, also be considered for possible incorporation at future reviews or at the request of
either Party immediately.

3
The Parties understand that ground handling services are part of related services in support of air services.
81
ARTICLE 6.3: REVIEW OF MOST FAVOURED NATION COMMITMENTS
If, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, a Party enters into any agreement on
trade in services with a non-Party, it shall give consideration to a request by the other Party
for the incorporation herein of treatment no less favourable than that provided under the
aforesaid agreement. Any such incorporation should maintain the overall balance of
commitments undertaken by each Party under this Agreement.
ARTICLE 6.4: MARKET ACCESS
1. With respect to market access through the modes of supply defined in Article 6.1, each
Party shall accord services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less
favourable than that provided for under the terms, limitations and conditions agreed and
specified in its Schedule of specific commitments
4
.
2. In sectors where market access commitments are undertaken, the measures which a Party
shall not maintain or adopt either on the basis of a regional subdivision or on the basis of its
entire territory, unless otherwise specified in its Schedule of specific commitments, are
defined as:
(a) limitations on the number of service suppliers whether in the form of numerical quotas,
monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirement of an economic needs test;
(b) limitations on the total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas
or the requirement of an economic needs test;
(c) limitations on the total number of service operations or the total quantity of services output
expressed in terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of
an economic needs test5
;
(d) limitations on the total number of natural persons that may be employed in a particular
service sector or that a service supplier may employ and who are necessary for, and directly
related to, the supply of a specific service in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement
of an economic needs test;

4
If a Party undertakes a market access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply
referred to in Article 6.1 and if the cross-border movement of capital is an essential part of the service itself, that
Party is thereby committed to allow such movement of capital. If a Party undertakes a market-access commitment in
relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in Article 6.1, it is thereby committed to
allow related transfers of capital into its territory.
5
Subparagraph (c) does not cover measures of a Party which limits inputs for the supply of services.
82
(e) measures which restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through
which a service supplier may supply a service; and
(f) limitations on the participation of foreign capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on
foreign shareholding or the total value of individual or aggregate foreign investment.
ARTICLE 6.5: NATIONAL TREATMENT
1. In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule of specific commitments, and subject to any
conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord to services and service
suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like
circumstances, to its own services and service suppliers6
.
2. Any subsequent establishment, acquisition and expansion of investments by a service
supplier that is incorporated, constituted, set up or otherwise duly organised under the law of
a Party, and which is owned by a service supplier of the other Party, shall be regarded as an
investment of the other Party, for the purpose of determining the applicable treatment to be
accorded under this Article7
.
3. The treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraph 1 means, with respect to a
regional or local level government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable
treatment accorded by that regional or local level government to like service suppliers of the
Party of which it forms a part.
4. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to services and service
suppliers of the other Party, either formally identical treatment or formally different
treatment to that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers.
5. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less
favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service
suppliers of a Party compared to like services or service suppliers of the other Party.

6
Specific commitments assumed under this Article shall not be construed to require any Party to
compensate for any inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the
relevant services or service suppliers.
7 The Parties understand that although such service suppliers may be accorded any better treatment which is
available under the regime of that Party, at the time of such subsequent establishment, acquisition and
expansion of investments, any such better treatment accorded shall not be construed as an automatic
modification to the Parties' respective Schedules in Annex I (Non-Conformity Measures for
Investment(Existing Measures)) or II (Non-Conformity Measures for Investment(Future Measures)) in
Chapter Ten (Investment).
83
ARTICLE 6.6: ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS
The Parties may negotiate commitments with respect to measures affecting trade in services
not subject to scheduling under Article 6.4 or 6.5, including those regarding qualifications,
standards or licencing matters. Such commitments shall be inscribed in a Party’s Schedule of
specific commitments.
ARTICLE 6.7: DOMESTIC REGULATION
1. In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that all
measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable,
objective and impartial manner.
2. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or
administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service
supplier of the other Party, for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate
remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services. Where such procedures are
not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the
Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.
3. Paragraph 2 shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or
procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of
its legal system.
4. Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service on which a specific
commitment has been made, the competent authorities of a Party shall, within a reasonable
period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under its laws and
regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application. At the request
of the applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue delay,
information concerning the status of the application.
5. With the objective of ensuring that domestic regulations, including measures relating to
qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licencing requirements,
do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, the Parties shall jointly review the
results of the negotiations on disciplines on these measures, pursuant to Article VI:4 of
GATS, with a view to their incorporation into this Chapter. The Parties note that such
disciplines aim to ensure that such requirements are inter alia:
(a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to
supply the service;
(b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service; and
84
(c) in the case of licencing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of
the service.
6. Pending the incorporation of disciplines pursuant to paragraph 5 for sectors where a Party
has undertaken specific commitments and subject to any terms, limitations, conditions or
qualifications set out therein, a Party shall not apply licencing and qualification requirements
and technical standards that nullify or impair such specific commitments in a manner which:
(a) does not comply with the criteria outlined in paragraph 5(a), (b) or (c); and
(b) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the specific
commitments in those sectors were made.
7. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with the obligations under paragraph 6,
account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations8
applied by that Party.
8. In sectors where specific commitments regarding professional services are undertaken,
each Party shall provide for adequate procedures to verify the competence of professionals of
the other Party.
ARTICLE 6.8: RECOGNITION
1. For the purposes of the fulfillment of its standards or criteria for the authorisation,
licencing or certification of services suppliers, a Party may recognise the education or
experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted in the other
Party.
2. After the date of entry into force of this Agreement, upon request being made in writing
by a Party to the other Party in any regulated service sector, the Parties shall encourage that
their respective professional bodies negotiate and conclude, within 12 months of the date of
entry into force of this Agreement, in that service sector for mutual recognition of education,
or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted in that service
sector, with a view to the achievement of early outcomes. Any delay or failure by these
professional bodies to reach and conclude agreement on the details of such agreement or
arrangements shall not be regarded as a breach of a Party’s obligations under this paragraph
and shall not be subject to Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement). Progress in this regard
will be continually reviewed by the Parties in the course of the review pursuant to Article
15.2 (Joint Committee and Review).

8 The term “relevant international organisations” refers to international bodies whose membership is open to
relevant bodies of both Parties.
85
3. Where a Party recognises, by agreement or arrangement, the education or experience
obtained, requirements met or licences or certifications granted in the territory of a country
that is not a Party to this Agreement, that Party shall accord the other Party, upon request,
adequate opportunity to negotiate its accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to
negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall
afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that the education or
experience obtained, requirements met or licences or certifications granted in the territory of
that other Party should also be recognised.
4. The Parties agree that they shall not be responsible in any way for the settlement of
disputes arising out of or under these agreements or arrangements for mutual recognition
concluded by their respective professional, standard-setting or self-regulatory bodies under
this Article and that the provisions of Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) shall not apply
to disputes arising out of, or under the provisions of such agreements or arrangements.
ARTICLE 6.9: MONOPOLY AND EXCLUSIVE SERVICE SUPPLIERS
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in
the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with
that Party's Schedule of specific commitments.
2. Where a Party's monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated
company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is
subject to that Party's Schedule of specific commitments, the Party shall ensure that such a
supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent
with such commitments.
3. If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of the other Party is
acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, it may request the other Party
establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to provide specific information
concerning the relevant operations in its territory.
4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers,
where a Party, formally or in effect:
(a) authorises or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and
(b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.
ARTICLE 6.10: BUSINESS PRACTICES
1. The Parties recognise that certain business practices of service suppliers, other than those
falling under Article 6.9, may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in services.
86
2. A Party shall, at the request of the other Party, enter into consultations with a view to
eliminating practices referred to in paragraph 1. The Party addressed shall accord full and
sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall cooperate through the supply of
publicly available non-confidential information of relevance to the matter in question. The
Party addressed shall also provide other information available to the requesting Party, subject
to its law and to the conclusion of satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding of its
confidentiality by the requesting Party.
ARTICLE 6.11: SAFEGUARD MEASURES
1. Neither Party shall take safeguard action against services and service suppliers of the
other Party from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Neither Party shall initiate or
continue any safeguard investigations in respect of services and service suppliers of the other
Party.
2. The Parties shall review the issue of safeguard measures in the context of developments in
international fora of which both Parties are party.
ARTICLE 6.12: PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS
1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 6.13, a Party shall not apply
restrictions on international transfers and payments for current transactions relating to its
specific commitments.
2. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties as members of
the International Monetary Fund under the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with them,
provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital transactions inconsistently
with its specific commitments regarding such transactions, except under Article 6.13 or at the
request of the Fund.
ARTICLE 6.13: RESTRICTIONS TO SAFEGUARD THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
1. In the event of serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties or a threat
thereof, a Party may, in accordance with Articles XI and XII of GATS adopt or maintain
restrictions on trade in services on which it has undertaken specific commitments, including
on payments or transfers for transactions relating to such obligations. It is recognised that
particular pressures on the balance of payments of a Party in the process of economic
development may necessitate the use of restrictions to ensure, inter alia, the maintenance of
a level of financial reserves adequate for the implementation of its programme of economic
development.
87
2. The restrictions referred to in paragraph 1 shall:
(a) be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund;
(b) avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and financial interests of
the other Party;
(c) not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances described in paragraph 1;
(d) be temporary and be phased out progressively as the situation specified in
paragraph 1 improves; and
(e) be applied on a national treatment basis and such that the other Party is treated no
less favourably than any country that is not a Party to this Agreement.
3. Any restrictions adopted or maintained under paragraph 1, or any changes therein, shall
be promptly notified to the other Party.
4. The Party adopting any restrictions under paragraph 1 shall commence consultations with
the other Party in order to review the restrictions adopted by it.
ARTICLE 6.14: GENERAL EXCEPTIONS
1. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would
constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party, or a
disguised restriction on trade in services, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to
prevent the adoption or enforcement by either Party of measures:
(a) necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order9
;
(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;
(c) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter including those relating to:
(i) the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the
effects of a default on services contracts;

9 The public order exception may be invoked by a Party only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is
posed to one of the fundamental interests of society.
88
(ii) the protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and
dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and
accounts; or
(iii) safety; or
(d) inconsistent with Article 6.5, provided that the difference in treatment is aimed at
ensuring the equitable or effective10 imposition or collection of direct taxes in
respect of services or service suppliers of the other Party.
2. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures
under which it accords more favourable treatment to persons of a non-Party than that
accorded to persons of the other Party to this Agreement as a result of a bilateral double
taxation avoidance agreement between the Party and such non-Party.
ARTICLE 6.15: SECURITY EXCEPTIONS
1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed:
(a) to require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary
to its essential security interests;
(b) to prevent a Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection
of its essential security interests:
(i) relating to the supply of services as carried out directly or indirectly for the
purposes of provisioning a military establishment;

10 Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes include
measures taken by a Party under its taxation system which:
(i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of nonresidents is
determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Party's territory; or
(ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party's territory; or
(iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including
compliance measures; or
(iv) apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of the other Party in order to ensure the
imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the Party's territory; or
(v) distinguish service suppliers subject to tax on world-wide taxable items from other service suppliers, in
recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or
(vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or
branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Party's tax base.
Tax terms or concepts in paragraph 1(d) and in this footnote are determined according to tax definitions and
concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party taking the
measure.
89
(ii) relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials from which
they are derived;
(iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; or
(iv) relating to protection of critical public infrastructure for communications,
power and water supply from deliberate attempts intended to disable or degrade such
infrastructures11
; or
(c) to prevent a Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the
United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.
2. Each Party shall inform the other Party to the fullest extent possible of measures taken
under paragraphs 1(b) and (c) and of their termination.
3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to accord the benefits of this
Chapter to a service supplier of the other Party where a Party adopts or maintains measures
in any laws and regulations which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential
security interests with respect to a non-Party or a service supplier of a non-Party that would
be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to such a service
supplier.
ARTICLE 6.16: SUBSIDIES
1. The Parties shall review the treatment of subsidies in the context of developments in
multilateral fora of which both Parties are party.
2. In the event that either Party considers that its interests have been adversely affected by a
subsidy or grant provided by the other Party, upon request, the other Party shall enter into
consultations with a view to resolving the matter.
3. During the consultations referred to in paragraph 2, the subsidising Party may, as it deems
fit, consider a request of the other Party for information relating to the subsidy scheme or
programme such as:
(a) its laws and regulations under which the measure is introduced;
(b) form of the measure, including grant, loan or tax measure;
(c) policy objective and/or purpose of the measure;

11 Paragraph 1(b)(iv) is subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would
constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party, or a disguised restriction
on trade in services.
90
(d) dates and duration of the programme or subsidy and any other time limits
attached to it; and
(e) eligibility requirements of the measure, including criteria applied with respect to
the potential population of beneficiaries.
4. Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement) shall not apply to any requests made or
consultations held under this Article or to any disputes that may arise between the Parties
under this Article.
ARTICLE 6.17: SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS
1. Each Party shall set out in its Schedule the specific commitments it undertakes under
Articles 6.4 through 6.6. With respect to sectors where such commitments are undertaken,
each Schedule of specific commitments shall specify:
(a) terms, limitations and conditions on market access;
(b) conditions and qualifications on national treatment;
(c) undertakings relating to additional commitments;
(d) where appropriate the time frame for implementation of such commitments; and
(e) the date of entry into force of such commitments.
2. Measures inconsistent with Articles 6.4 and 6.5 shall be inscribed in the column relating
to Article 6.4. In this case the inscription will be considered to provide a condition or
qualification to Article 6.5 as well.
3. Schedules of specific commitments shall be annexed to this Chapter as Annexes 6-A and
6-B and shall form an integral part of this Agreement.
4. Regarding commitments on Articles 6.4 and 6.5 for trade in services, only the Schedule of
specific commitments in Annex 6-A or 6-B applies.
ARTICLE 6.18: MODIFICATION OF SCHEDULES
1. A Party may modify or withdraw any commitment in its Schedule, at any time after three
years have elapsed from the date on which that commitment entered into force, in accordance
with this Article. The modifying Party shall notify the other Party of its intent to so modify
or withdraw a commitment no later than three months before the intended date of
implementation of the modification or withdrawal.
91
2. At the request of the other Party, the modifying Party shall enter into negotiations with a
view to reaching agreement on any necessary compensatory adjustment. In such
negotiations and agreement, the Party shall endeavour to maintain a general level of mutually
advantageous commitments not less favourable to trade than that provided for in the
Schedule of specific commitments prior to such negotiations. The Parties shall endeavour to
conclude negotiations on such compensatory adjustment to mutual satisfaction within six
months, failing which recourse may be had to Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement).
ARTICLE 6.19: PROGRESSIVE LIBERALISATION
The Parties shall endeavour to review their Schedules of specific commitments at least once
every three years, or earlier, at the request of either Party, with a view to facilitating the
elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination between the Parties with regard to
trade in services covered in this Chapter over a period of time. In this process, there shall be
due respect for the national policy objectives and the level of development of the Parties, in
both overall and individual sectors.
ARTICLE 6.20: TRANSPARENCY
1. Each Party shall publish promptly and, except in emergency situations, at the latest by the
time of their entry into force, all relevant measures of general application which pertain to or
affect the operation of this Chapter. International agreements pertaining to or affecting trade
in services to which a Party is a signatory shall also be published.
2. Where publication as referred to in paragraph 1 is not practicable, such information shall
be made otherwise publicly available.
3. Each Party shall respond promptly to all requests by the other Party for specific
information on any of its measures of general application or international agreements within
the meaning of paragraph 1. Each Party shall also establish one or more enquiry points to
provide specific information to the other Party, upon request, on all such matters.
ARTICLE 6.21: DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Nothing in this Agreement shall require each Party to provide confidential information, the
disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public
interest, or which would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises,
public or private.
ARTICLE 6.22: DENIAL OF BENEFITS
Subject to prior notification and consultation, a Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter:
(a) to the supply of a service, if it establishes that the service is supplied from or in 
92
the territory of a country that is not a Party to this Agreement;
(b) in the case of the supply of a maritime transport service, if it establishes
that the service is supplied by
(i) a vessel registered under the laws of a non-Party, and
(ii) a person which operates or uses the vessel in whole or in part but
which is of a non-Party;
(c) to a service provider of the other Party where the Party establishes
that the service is being provided by a juridical person that is owned or controlled by persons
of a non-Party or of the denying Party and that has no real and continuous business activities
or no substantive business operations in the territory of the other Party; or
(d) to a service supplier of the other Party if the service supplier is a juridical
person owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party, and the denying Party adopts or
maintains measures which include notification or an order, with respect to the non-Party or a
person of the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the juridical person or that would be
violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the juridical person.
ARTICLE 6.23: SERVICES-INVESTMENT LINKAGE
1. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties confirm, in respect of this Chapter, that:
(a) subject to paragraph 2, the following articles of Chapter Ten (Investment)
apply, mutatis mutandis, to measures affecting the supply of service by a service supplier of
a Party through commercial presence in the territory of the other Party, only to the extent that
they relate to an investment, regardless of whether or not such a service sector is scheduled
in a Party's Schedule of specific commitments in Annex 6-A or 6-B:
(i) Article 10.4 (Minimum Standard of Treatment);

(Investment) apply, mutatis mutandis, to measures affecting the supply of financial services
by a service supplier of a Party through commercial presence in the territory of the other
Party, only to the extent that they relate to an investment, regardless of whether or not such a
service sector is scheduled in a Party's Schedule of specific commitments in Annex 6-A or 6-
B:
(a) Article 10.12 (Expropriation and Compensation); and
(b) Article 10.21 (Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an Investor of

virtue of such recognition of rights and claims, and the transfer of such payment.
ARTICLE 10.15: SPECIAL FORMALITIES AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Nothing in Article 10.3 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or
maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the
establishment of investments by investors of the other Party, such as the requirement

such formalities do not materially impair the protection afforded by a Party to
investors of the other Party and investments of investors of the other Party pursuant to
this Chapter.
2. Notwithstanding Article 10.3, a Party may require an investor of the other
Party, or its investment in its territory, to provide routine information concerning that

any such encouragement.

of the denying Party.

that is an enterprise of the other Party where a Party adopts or
maintains measures in any of its laws or regulations which it considers
necessary for the protection of its essential security interests with
respect to a non-Party or an investor of a non-Party that would be
violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded
to such an enterprise or to its investments.

Parties regarding Security Exceptions for Investment and Non-justiciability of
Security Exceptions set out in Annexes 10-B and 10-C respectively, which shall form

of measures taken under paragraphs 1, 2(b) and (c) and of their termination, if such
measures were taken.
ARTICLE 10.19: ACCESS TO JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
Each Party shall within its territory accord to investors of the other Party treatment no
less favourable than the treatment, which it accords in like circumstances to its own
investors, with respect to access to its courts of justice and administrative tribunals

would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party, or a
disguised restriction on investment.

investors’ rights.
ARTICLE 10.20: OTHER OBLIGATIONS

position entitling investors of the other Party and investments by investors of the other
Party to treatment more favourable than is provided for by this Chapter, such position
shall not be affected by this Chapter.
Section C: Settlement of Disputes
ARTICLE 10.21: SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN A PARTY AND AN INVESTOR OF
THE OTHER PARTY
1. This Article establishes a mechanism for settlement of investment disputes
under this Chapter and assures equal treatment among the investors or investments of
both the Parties in accordance with principles of international reciprocity and due
process before an arbitral tribunal. This Article shall apply to disputes between a
Party and an investor of the other Party concerning an alleged breach of an obligation
of the former Party under this Chapter, which causes loss or damage to the investor or
its investments.
2. The parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by
consultations and negotiations, which may include the use of non-binding third-party
procedures.
3. Any such dispute which has not been settled within a period of six months
from the date of request for consultations and negotiations may be submitted to the
courts or administrative tribunals of the Party concerned or to arbitration. In the latter
event, the investor has the choice among any of the following:
(a) the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the disputing Party and the
Party of the disputing investor are parties to the ICSID Convention;
(b) the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the disputing
Party or the Party of the disputing investor, but not both, is a party to
the ICSID Convention;
(c) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or
(d) any other arbitral institution or in accordance with any other arbitral
rules, if the parties to the dispute so agree.
4. Once the investor has submitted the dispute to either the courts or
administrative tribunals of the disputing Party or any of the arbitration mechanisms
provided for in paragraph 3, the choice of the procedure shall be final.
232
5. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of a dispute to arbitration under
paragraphs 3(a), (b) and (c) in accordance with the provisions of this Article,
conditional upon:
(a) the submission of the dispute to such arbitration takes place within
three years from the date on which the disputing investor became
aware, or should reasonably have become aware, of a breach of an
obligation under this Chapter and of the loss or damage incurred by the
disputing investor or its investment; and
(b) the disputing investor gives written notice which shall be delivered at
least 90 days before the claim to arbitration is submitted, to the
disputing Party of its intention to submit the dispute to such arbitration
and which
(i) selects one of the fora in paragraph 3(a), (b) or (c) as the forum
for dispute settlement, and
(ii) briefly summarises the alleged breaches of the disputing Party
under this Chapter (including the articles alleged to have been
breached) and the loss or damage allegedly caused to the
investor or its investment.
6. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, the disputing investor may initiate or continue
an action that seeks interim injunctive relief that does not involve the payment of
monetary damages or the resolution of the substance of the matter in dispute before a
court or administrative tribunal of the disputing Party, provided that the action is
brought for the sole purpose of preserving the disputing investor’s rights and interests
during the pendency of the arbitration.
7. Neither Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim,
in respect of a dispute which one of its investors and the other Party shall have
consented to submit or have submitted to arbitration under this Article, unless such
other Party has failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute.
Diplomatic protection, for the purposes of this paragraph, shall not include informal
diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement of the dispute.
Section D: Final Provisions
ARTICLE 10.22: ENTRY INTO FORCE, DURATION AND TERMINATION
In the event that this Agreement is terminated, the provisions of this Chapter, the
provisions in Chapter Fourteen (Dispute Settlement), and other provisions in this
Agreement necessary for or consequential to the application of this Chapter, except
pre-establishment national treatment under Articles 10.3 and 10.8, shall continue to be
in effect with respect to investments made or acquired before the date of termination
of this Agreement for a further period of 15 years after the date of termination and

233
ANNEX 10-A
EXPROPRIATION
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:
1. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it
interferes with a tangible or intangible property right in an investment made in the territory of
that Party.
2. Article 10.12.1 addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an
investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title
or outright seizure.
3. The second situation addressed by Article 10.12.1 is indirect expropriation, where an
action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without
formal transfer of title or outright seizure:
(a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a
specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-bycase, fact-based inquiry that considers all relevant factors relating to the
investment, including:
(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that
an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the
economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish
that an indirect expropriation has occurred;
(ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct,
reasonable investment-backed expectations;
6
and
(iii) the character of the government action, including its objectives and
context. Relevant considerations could include whether the
government action imposes a special sacrifice on the particular investor
or investment that exceeds what the investor or investment should be
expected to endure for the public interest.
(b) Except in rare circumstances, such as, for example, when a measure or series
of measures is extremely severe or disproportionate in light of its purpose or
effect, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and
applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health,
safety, the environment, and real estate price stabilisation (through, for
example, measures to improve the housing conditions for low-income
households), do not constitute indirect expropriations.

6
For greater certainty, whether an investor’s investment-backed expectations are reasonable depends in part on
the nature and extent of governmental regulation in the relevant sector. For example, an investor’s expectations
that regulations will not change are less likely to be reasonable in a heavily regulated sector than in a less
heavily regulated sector.
234
ANNEX 10-B
SECURITY EXCEPTIONS FOR INVESTMENT
The Parties confirm the following understanding with respect to interpretation and/or
implementation of this Chapter:
(a) the measures referred to in Article 10.18.2(d) are measures where the intention
and objective of the Party imposing the measures is for the protection of its
essential security interests. These measures shall be imposed on a nondiscriminatory basis and may be found in any of its laws or regulations:
(i) In the case of India, the applicable measures referred to in Article
10.18.2(d) are essentially set out in the regulations framed under the
Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). India shall upon request
by Korea, provide information on the measures concerned; and
(ii) In the case of Korea- Korea does not presently adopt or maintain any
unilateral measures against a non-Party or investor of a non-Party in its
laws or regulations; and
(b) the measures which a Party adopts or maintains with respect to a non-Party or
investors of a non-Party shall not impinge upon the other Party's sovereign
rights to conduct its foreign policy nor shall it prohibit enterprises of foreign
enterprises that are subject to such measures from establishing themselves in
the other Party. 
235
ANNEX 10-C
NON JUSTICIABILITY OF SECURITY EXCEPTIONS
The Parties confirm the following understanding with respect to the interpretation and/or
implementation of this Chapter:
(a) in respect of disputes submitted to arbitration pursuant to Article 10.21.3,
where the disputing Party asserts as a defence that the measure alleged to be a
breach is within the scope of a security exception as set out in Article 10.18.2,
any decision of the disputing Party taken on such security considerations shall
be non-justiciable in that it shall not be open to any arbitral tribunal to review
the merits of any such decision, even where the arbitral proceedings concern
an assessment of any claim for damages and/or compensation, or an
adjudication of any other issues referred to the tribunal; and
(b) for the avoidance of doubt, Article 10.21.3 shall be applicable in the arbitral
proceedings for damages and/or compensation due to the measures taken
under security exceptions as set out in Article 10.18.2.
