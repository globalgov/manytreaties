this protocolin accordance with their tasks, arising from the framework convention on the protection and sustainable development of the carpathians, hereinafter referred to as the "carpathian convention" (kyiv, 2003), of pursuing a comprehensive policy and cooperating for the protection and sustainable development of the carpathians;aware of the fact that during the last decades, the initiation and escalation of certain human activities have led to significant changes of the biological and landscape diversity of the carpathians, which are the natural habitat for many different flora and fauna species;aiming to mitigate threats to the biological and landscape diversity of the carpathians and to promote sustainable use of their natural resources;in compliance with their obligations under article 4 of the framework convention on the protection and sustainable development of the carpathians;noting that all parties to the protocol are parties to the convention on biological diversity (rio de janeiro, 1992); the conservation of european wildlife and natural habitats (bern, 1979); the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (washington, 1973), the convention on wetlands of international importance especially as waterfowl habitat (ramsar, 1971) and the convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and
