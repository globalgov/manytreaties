Agreement on Delimitation of Marine and Submarine Areas and Maritime
Cooperation between the Republic of Colombia and the Dominican Republic
(13 January 1978)
The Governments of the Republic of Colombia and the Dominican Republic, being aware of the cordial friendship
prevailing in relations between the two countries, and considering:
That it is their responsibility to guarantee for their peoples the renewable and non-renewable natural resources situated
in the marine and submarine areas subject to their sovereignty and jurisdiction;
That their common interests in the Caribbean region make it essential to establish the closest co-operation, with a view
to adopting appropriate measures for the preservation, conservation and rational utilization of the resources to be found in the
said maritime areas;
That it is necessary to co-operate in scientific research concerning the living resources in zones frequented by specific
migratory species;
That it is expedient to delimit their respective marine and submarine areas;
Have for that purpose appointed as their Plenipotentiaries:
His Excellency the President of the Republic of Colombia:
Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre, Minister for Foreign Affairs;
His Excellency the President of the Dominican Republic:
Vice-Admiral Ramon Emilio Jimenez Jr., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs;
Who, having exchanged their full powers, found to be in good and due form, have agreed as follows:
Article 1
The boundary between the marine and submarine areas belonging to each country shall be determined by using, as a
general rule, the principle of the median line whose points are all equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which
the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured.
Article 2
In accordance with the procedure established in the preceding article, the boundary shall be constituted by a line drawn
from a point whose geographical position is at latitude 15&#186;02'00"north and longitude 73&#186;27'30"west through a point at latitude
15&#186;00'40"north and longitude 71&#186;40'30"west towards another point at latitude 15&#186;18'00"north and longitude 69&#186;29'30"west as far
as the point where delimitation with a third State is required.
PARAGRAPH:
The line and points agreed upon are shown on nautical chart No. 25,000, of the Defense Mapping Agency of the United
States of America, which, having been signed by the Plenipotentiaries, is appended to this Agreement.
Article 3
A Zone of Joint Scientific Research and Fishing Exploitation shall be established which shall be situated within four
straight lines drawn between the following points, each located at a distance of 20 nautical miles from the line which constitutes
the marine boundary between the two countries:
STRAIGHT LINE A: From point 1 (latitude 15&#186; 22' 00" north and longitude 73&#186; 19' 30" west) and point 2
(latitude 14&#186; 42' 00" north and longitude 73&#186; 20' 30" west).
STRAIGHT LINE B: From point 2 (latitude 14&#186; 42' 00" north and longitude 73&#186; 20' 30" west) and point 3
(latitude 14&#186; 40' 30" north and longitude 71&#186; 40' 30" west).
STRAIGHT LINE C: From point 3 (latitude 14&#186; 40' 30" north and longitude 71&#186; 40' 30" west) and point 4
(latitude 15&#186; 20' 00" north and longitude 71&#186; 40' 00" west)
STRAIGHT LINE D: From point 4 (latitude 15&#186; 20' 00" north and longitude
71&#186; 40' 00" west) and point 1 (latitude 15&#186; 22' 00" north and longtitude 73&#186; 19' 30" west).
In the area under its sovereignty and jurisdiction within the above-mentioned zone, each country undertakes to adopt the
following measures:
(a) To permit nationals of the other State to carry out fishing activities, provided that they are carried out rationally
and in accordance with the provisions of the country in whose area the said activities are taking place.
(b) To provide the other Party with the results of research concerning living resources carried out in that area,
particularly that concerning thunnidae and other migratory species.
(c) To co-ordinate and carry out with the other Party such scientific research activities as may be jointly agreed
upon.
(d) To provide the other Party periodically with information regarding the type and size of the catch obtained in the
area.
(e) To establish close co-operation for purposes of surveillance of the Zone in order to ensure that nationals of third
States do not carry out unauthorized fishing activities in it.
PARAGRAPH:
The Zone of Joint Scientific Research and Fishing Exploitation established in this Agreement and the regime adopted for
it may be modified by agreement between the Parties or rescinded on the initiative of either Party upon ninety (90) days', prior
notice to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the other State.
Article 4
The Parties shall co-operate with one another to the maximum extent possible with a view to controlling, reducing and
preventing pollution of the marine environment which may affect the neighbouring State.
They likewise agree to work together if accidents involving tankers, vessels and aircraft occur in the maritime areas of
either country and pollution threatens the maritime areas of the other State.
Article 5
The Parties shall co-ordinate as far as possible any conservation measures applied by each of them in its marine and
submarine areas, particularly in respect of those species which migrate beyond their respective maritime zones, taking into
account for that purpose the most reliable and up-to-date scientific data. Such co-operation shall not affect the sovereign right of
each State to adopt, within the framework of its respective jurisdiction, such rules and regulations on the subject as it deems
appropriate.
Article 6
The Parties shall endeavour to resolve any differences which may arise concerning the interpretation, or during the
application, of this Agreement through the diplomatic channel before using the other methods of peaceful settlement recognized
under international law.
This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the exchange of the respective instruments of ratification, which
shall take place in the city of Bogota.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the plenipotentiaries have signed this Agreement in duplicate, both texts being equally
authentic.
