amendments to the schedule to the international convention for the regulation of whaling of 2 december 1946source: at the 54th annual meeting of iwc in shimonoseki, japan from 20-24 may 2002, no modifications were made to the provision for zero catch limits for commercial whaling with effect from the 1986 coastal and 1985/86 pelagic whaling seasons, but the provisions regarding catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling were modified. the following amendments to the schedule of the international convention for the regulation of whaling are therefore necessary (changes are in bold italics): paragraphs 11 and 12, and tables 1, 2 and 3: substitute the dates 2002/2003 pelagic season, 2003 coastal season, 2003 season, or 2003 as appropriate. paragraph 13.(b)(1): delete sub-paragraph (i), since no catch limits were set for bowhead whales from the bering-chukchi-beaufort seas stock, and renumber existing sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) as (i) and (ii) respectively. paragraph 13.(b)(2)(i): substitute the dates 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 by 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. paragraph 13.(b)(3)(ii) and (iii) and footnote 2 in table 1: substitute the dates 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 by 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. paragraph 13.(b)(4): replace the existing paragraph with the following text: for the seasons 2003-2007 the number of humpback whales to be taken by the bequians of st. vincent and the grenadines shall not exceed 20. the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption in st. vincent and the grenadines. such whaling must be conducted under formal legislation that accords with the submission of the government of st. vincent and the grenadines (iwc/54/as 8 rev2). the quota for the seasons 2006 and 2007 shall only become operative after the commission has received advice from the scientific committee that the take of 4 humpback whales for each season is unlikely to endanger the stock. please also note that the following editorial footnote has been added to paragraph 7.(b) concerning the indian ocean sanctuary: at its 54th annual meeting in 2002, the commission agreed to continue this prohibition but did not discuss whether or not it should set a time when it should be reviewed again. at its next annual meeting, the commission may wish to consider whether or not a time should be set when the prohibition should be reviewed. as there are quite a few amendments this year, they are also illustrated in the attached amended schedule. in accordance with article v of the convention, these amendments become effective with respect to each contracting government ninety days following the date of this letter, unless any contracting government lodges an objection, in which case the procedure under article v, paragraph 3 of the convention will be followed. the ninety days period will expire on 10 september 2002. in the absence of objections by that date, the amendments will become effective. contracting governments will be notified accordingly.
