All straight lines are geodesic lines. The agreed-upon line is defined by geographic latitude and longitude in
accordance with the World Geodesic System 1984 (WGS84). The line shall be subject to a technical revision before 1 January
1999.
By way of illustration, the boundary line and the above-mentioned points have been drawn on the sketch map annexed
to this Agreement.
(1) The boundary point A has been established in cooperation with the Kingdom of Norway and shall be confirmed
through bilateral agreements with the Government of the Kingdom of Norway.
Article 2
If natural resources are found in or on the continental shelf of one of the Parties and the other Party is of the opinion
that the resources extend onto its continental shelf, the latter Party may, by presenting the evidence upon which the opinion is
based, e.g., geological or geophysical data, submit this to the first-mentioned Party.
If such an opinion is submitted, the Parties shall initiate discussions on the extent of the resources and the possibility
for exploitation, with a presentation of each of the Parties' information hereon. If it is established during these discussions that
the resources extend across both Parties' parts of the continental shelf and also that the resources in the area of one Party can be
exploited wholly or in part from the area of the other Party or that the exploitation of the resources in the area of one Party would
affect the possibility of exploitation of the resources in the area of the other Party, an agreement concerning the exploitation of
the resources shall be made at the request of one of the Parties.
Article 3
This Agreement is without prejudice to other delimitation questions between the Kingdom of Denmark and the
Republic of Iceland.
Article 4
This Agreement shall enter into force when the Parties have informed each other in writing that the necessary
procedures have been concluded. However, the provision on the coordinates of boundary point A shall only enter into force
when the Government of the Kingdom of Norway has informed the Parties in writing that the determination of that point has
been confirmed.
