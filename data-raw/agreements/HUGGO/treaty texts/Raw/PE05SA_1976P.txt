or the safety of a ship or aircraft is threatened. such dumpings shall immediately be reported to the organization and, either through the organization or directly, to any party or parties likely to be affected, together with full details of the circumstances and of the nature and quantities of the wastes or other matter dumped ARTICLE 9if a party in a critical situation of an exceptional nature considers that wastes or other matter not listed in article 4.2 of this protocol cannot be disposed of on land without unacceptable danger or damage, above all for the safety of human life, the party concerned shall forthwith consult the organization. the organization, after consulting the parties to this protocol, shall recommend methods of storage or the most satisfactory means of destruction or disposal under the prevailing circumstances. the party shall inform the organization of the steps adopted in pursuance of these recommendations. the parties pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations ARTICLE 101. each party shall designate one or more competent authorities to:(a) issue the permits provided for in article 5;(b) keep records of the nature and quantities of the wastes or other matter permitted to be dumped and of the location, date and method of dumping.2. the competent authorities of each party shall issue the permits provided for in article 5 in respect of the wastes or other matter intended for dumping:(a) loaded in its territory;(b) loaded by a ship or aircraft registered in its territory or flying its flag, when the loading occurs in the territory of a state not party to this protocol ARTICLE 111. each party shall apply the measures required to implement this protocol to all:(a) ships and aircraft registered in its territory or flying its flag;(b) ships and aircraft loading in its territory wastes or other matter which are to be dumped;(c) ships and aircraft believed to be engaged in dumping in areas under its jurisdiction in this matter ARTICLE 12each party undertakes to issue instructions to its maritime inspection ships and aircraft and to other appropriate services to report to its authorities any incidents or conditions in the mediterranean sea area which give rise to suspicions that dumping in contravention of the provisions of this protocol has occurred or is about to occur. that party shall, if it considers it appropriate, report accordingly to any other party concerned ARTICLE 13nothing in this protocol shall affect the right of each party to adopt other measures, in accordance with international law, to prevent pollution due to dumping ARTICLE 141. ordinary meetings of the parties to this protocol shall be held in conjunction with ordinary meetings of the contracting parties to the convention held pursuant to article 18 of the convention. the parties to this protocol may also hold extraordinary meetings in conformity with article 18 of the convention.2. it shall be the function of the meetings

english, french and spanish languages, the four texts being equally authoritative ANNEX the factors to be considered in establishing criteria governing the issue of permits for the dumping of matter at sea taking into account article 6 include:a. characteristics and composition of the matter1. total amount and average compositions of matter dumped (e.g. per year).2. form (e.g. solid, sludge, liquid or gaseous).3. properties: physical (e.g. solubility and density), chemical and biochemical (e.g. oxygen demand, nutrients) and biological (e.g. presence of viruses, bacteria, yeasts, parasites).4. toxicity.5. persistence: physical, chemical and biological.6. accumulation and biotransformation in biological materials or sediments.7. susceptibility to physical, chemical and biochemical changes and interaction in the aquatic environment with other dissolved organic and inorganic materials.8. probability of production of taints or other changes reducing marketability of resources (fish, shellfish, etc.).b. characteristics of dumping site and method of deposit1. location (e.g. coordinates of the dumping area, depth and distance from the coast), location in relation to other areas (e.g. amenity areas, spawning, nursery and fishing areas and exploitable resources).2. rate of disposal per specific period (e.g. quantity per day, per week, per month).3. methods of packaging and containment, if any.4. initial dilution achieved by proposed method of release, particularly the speed of the ship.5. dispersal characteristics (e.g. effects of currents, tides and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing).6. water characteristics (e.g. temperature, ph, salinity, stratification, oxygen indices of pollution-dissolved oxygen (do), chemical oxygen demand (cod), biochemical oxygen demand (bod), nitrogen present in organic and mineral form, including ammonia, suspended matter, other nutrients and productivity).7. bottom characteristics (e.g. topography, geochemical and geological characteristics and biological productivity).8. existence and effects of other dumpings which have been made in the dumping area (e.g. heavy metal background reading and organic carbon content).9. when issuing a permit for dumping, the contracting parties shall endeavour to determine whether an adequate scientific basis exists for assessing the consequences of such dumping in the area concerned, in accordance with the foregoing provisions and taking into account seasonal variations.c. general considerations and conditions1. possible effects on amenities (e.g. presence of floating or stranded material, turbidity, objectionable odour, discolouration and foaming).2. possible effects on marine life, fish and shellfish culture, fish stocks and fisheries, sea-weed harvesting and culture.3. possible effects on other uses of the sea (e.g. impairment of water quality for industrial use, underwater corrosion of structures, interference with ship operations from floating materials, interference with fishing or navigation through deposit of waste or solid objects on the sea floor and protection of areas of special importance for scientific or conservation purposes).4. the practical availability of alternative land-based methods of treatment, disposal or elimination or of treatment to render the matter less harmful for sea dumping.
