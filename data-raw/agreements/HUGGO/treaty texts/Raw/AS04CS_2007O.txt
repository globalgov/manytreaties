PART II: OBLIGATIONS AND DISCIPLINES 


Article 3
Transparency


Article III of the GATS is, mutatis  mutandis,  incorporated into and shall form an integral part of this Agreement.


Article 4
Disclosure of Confidential Information


Article III bis of the GATS is, mutatis mutandis, incorporated into and shall form an integral part of this Agreement. 


Article 5
Domestic Regulation

In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken under Part III, each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.
a. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service supplier, for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services.  Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.b. The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system.
Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service on which a specific commitment under this Agreement has been made, the competent authorities of each Party shall:
in the case of an incomplete application, at the request of the applicant, identify all the additional information that is required to complete the application and provide the opportunity to remedy deficiencies within a reasonable timeframe;
at the request of the applicant, provide without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application; and
if an application is terminated or denied, to the maximum extent possible, inform the applicant in writing and without delay the reasons for such action.  The applicant will have the possibility of resubmitting, at its discretion, a new application.
With the objective of ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, the Parties shall jointly review the results of the negotiations on disciplines on these measures, pursuant to Article VI.4 of GATS, with a view to their incorporation into this Agreement.  The Parties note that such disciplines aim to ensure that such requirements are, inter alia:
based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to  supply the service;
not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service;
in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of the service.
a. In sectors in which a Party has undertaken specific commitments under Part III, pending the incorporation of the disciplines referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, that  Party shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and technical standards that nullify or impair its obligation under this Agreement in a manner which:
does not comply with the criteria outlined in subparagraphs 4(a), (b) or (c) of this Article; and
could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the specific commitments in those sectors were made.
b. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with the obligation under paragraph 5(a) of this Article, account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations4  applied by that Party.
In sectors where specific commitments regarding professional services are undertaken, each Party shall provide for adequate procedures to verify the competence of professionals of any other Party.

Article 6
Recognition

For the purposes of fulfilment of their respective standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, each Party may recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in another Party.  Such recognition, which may be achieved through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement between the Parties or the relevant competent bodies or may be accorded autonomously.
Two or more Parties may enter into, or encourage their relevant competent bodies to enter into, negotiations on recognition of qualification requirements, qualification procedures, licensing and/or registration procedures for the purposes of fulfilment of their respective standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers.
A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate opportunity for other interested Parties to negotiate their accession to such an agreement  or arrangement or to negotiate comparable ones with it.  Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for any other Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licenses, or certifications obtained or requirements met in that other Party’s territory should be recognised.
A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of services suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services. 

Article 7
Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers

Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with that Party’s obligations under specific commitments.
Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to that Party’s specific commitments, the Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.
If any Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of any other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article, that Party may request the Party establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to provide specific information concerning the relevant operations.
The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect,
authorises or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and
substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.

Article 8
Business Practices

The Parties recognise that certain business practices of services suppliers, other than those falling under Article 7, may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in services.
Each Party shall, at the request of any other Party (the “Requesting Party”), enter into consultations with a view to eliminating practices referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.  The Party addressed (the “Requested Party”) shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall cooperate through the supply of publicly available non-confidential information of relevance to the matter in question.  The Requested Party shall also provide other information available to the Requesting Party, subject to its domestic law and to the conclusion of satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding of its confidentiality by the Requesting Party.

Article 9
Safeguards

The Parties note the multilateral negotiations pursuant to Article X of the GATS on the question of emergency safeguard measures based on the principle of non-discrimination.  Upon the conclusion of such multilateral negotiations, the Parties shall conduct a review for the purpose of discussing appropriate amendments to this Agreement so as to incorporate the results of such multilateral negotiations.
In the event that the implementation of this Agreement causes substantial adverse impact to a service sector of a Party before the conclusion of the multilateral negotiations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the affected Party may request for consultations with the other Party for the purposes of discussing any measure with respect to the affected service sector.  Any measure taken pursuant to this paragraph shall be mutually agreed by the Parties concerned. The Parties concerned shall take into account the circumstances of the particular case and give sympathetic consideration to the Party seeking to take a measure.

Article 10
Payments and Transfers

Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 11, a Party shall not apply restrictions on international transfers and payments for current transactions relating to its specific commitments.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of any Party who is a member of the International Monetary Fund under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital transactions inconsistently with its specific commitments regarding such transactions, except under Article 11 or at the request of the Fund.

Article 11
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments


Where a Party is in serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties or threat thereof, it may adopt or maintain restrictions on trade in services in accordance with Article XII of the GATS.


Article 12
General Exceptions


Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade in services, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any Party of measures:


necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order5;
necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;
necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement including those relating to:
the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on services contracts;
the protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and accounts;
safety;
inconsistent with Article 19, provided that the difference in treatment is aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective6  imposition or collection of direct taxes in respect of services or service suppliers of other Parties;
provided that the difference in treatment is the result of an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation or provisions on the avoidance of double taxation in any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Party is bound.

Article 13
Security Exceptions


Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:

to require any Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or
to prevent any Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests, including but not limited to:
action relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;
action relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment;
action taken so as to protect critical communications infrastructure from deliberate attempts intended to disable or degrade such infrastructure;
action taken in time of war or other emergency in domestic or international relations; or
to prevent any Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.

Article 14
Subsidies

Except where provided in this Article, this Agreement shall not apply to subsidies or grants provided by a Party, or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued receipt of such subsidies or grants, whether or not such subsidies or grants are offered exclusively to domestic services, service consumers or service suppliers.  If such subsidies or grants significantly affect trade in services committed under this Agreement, any Party may request for consultations with a view to an amicable resolution of this matter.
Pursuant to this Agreement, the Parties shall:
on request, provide information on subsidies related to trade in services committed under this Agreement to any requesting Party; and
review the treatment of subsidies when relevant disciplines are developed by the WTO.

Article 15
WTO Disciplines

The increasing participation of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam in this Agreement shall be facilitated through negotiated specific commitments, relating to:


the strengthening of their domestic services capacity and its efficiency and competitiveness, inter alia through access to technology on a commercial basis;
the improvement of their access to distribution channels and information networks;

limitations on the participation of foreign capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on foreign shareholding or the total value of individual or aggregate foreign investment.

Article 19
National Treatment

In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule, and subject to any conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of any other Party, in respect of all measures affecting the supply of services, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers9 .
A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 of this Article by according to services and service suppliers of any other Party, either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers.
Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the Party compared to like services or service suppliers of any other Party.

Article 20
Additional Commitments

The Parties may negotiate commitments with respect to measures affecting trade in services not subject to scheduling under Articles 18 and 19 including those regarding qualifications, standards or licensing matters.  Such commitments shall be inscribed in a Party’s Schedule.
