GENERAL PROVISIONS OF ACP-EEC COOPERATION Chapter 1. Objectives and Principles of Cooperation ARTICLE 1. The Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the ACP States, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as the "Contracting Parties"), hereby conclude this cooperation Convention in order to promote and expedite the economic, cultural and social development, of the ACP States and to consolidate and diversify their relations in a spirit of solidarity and mutual interest. The Contracting Parties thereby affirm their undertaking to continue, strengthen and render more effective the system of cooperation established under the first, second and third ACP-EEC Conventions and confirm the special character of their relations, based on their reciprocal interest, and the specific nature of their cooperation. The Contracting Parties hereby express their resolve to intensify their effort to create, with a view to a more just and balanced international economic order, a model for relations between developed and developing states and to work together to affirm in the international context the principles underlying their cooperation. ARTICLE 2. ACP-EEC cooperation, underpinned by a legally binding system and the existence of joint institutions, shall be exercised on the basis of the following fundamental principles: - equality between partners, respect for their sovereignty, mutual interest and interdependence, - the right of each State to determine its own political, social, cultural and economic policy options, - security of their relations based on the acquis of their system of cooperation. ARTICLE 3. The ACP States shall determine the development prin- ciples, strategies and models for their economies and societies in all sovereignty. ARTICLE 4. Support shall be provided in ACP-EEC cooperation for the ACP States' efforts to achieve comprehensive self-reliant and selfsustained development based on their cultural and social values, their human capacities, their natural resources and their economic potential in order to promote the ACP States' social, cultural and economic progress and the well-being of their populations through the satisfaction of their basic needs, the recognition of the role of women and the enhancement of people's capacities, with respect for their dignity. Such development shall be based on a sustainable balance between its economic objectives, the rational management of the environment and the enhancement of natural and human resources. ARTICLE 5. 1. Cooperation shall be directed towards development centred on man, the main protagonist and beneficiary of development, which thus entails respect for and promotion of all human rights. Cooperation operations shall thus be conceived in accordance with the positive approach, where respect for human rights is recognized as a basic factor of real development and where cooperation is conceived as a contribution to the promotion of these rights. In this context development policy and cooperation are closely linked with the respect for and enjoyment of fundamental human rights. The role and potential of initiatives taken by individuals and groups shall also be recognized and fostered in order to achieve in practice real participation of the population in the development process in accordance with Article 13. 2. Hence the Parties reiterate their deep attachment to human dignity and human rights, which are legitimate aspirations of individuals and peoples. The rights in question are all human rights, the various categories thereof being indivisible and inter-related, each having its own legitimacy; non-discriminatory treatment; fundamental human rights; civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights. Every individual shall have the right, in his own country or in a host country, to respect for his dignity and protection by the law. ACP-EEC cooperation shall help abolish the obstacles preventing individuals and peoples from actually enjoying to the full their economic, social and cultural rights and this must be achieved through the development which is essential to their dignity, their well-being and their self-fulfilment. To this end, the Parties shall strive, jointly or each in its own sphere of responsibility, to help eliminate the causes of situations of misery unworthy of the human condition and of deep-rooted economic and social inequalities. The Contracting Parties hereby reaffirm their existing obligations and commitment in international law to strive to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on ethnic group, origin, race, nationality, colour, sex, language, religion or any other situation. This commitment applies more particularly to any situation in the ACP States or in the Community that may adversely affect the pursuit of the objectives of the Convention, and to the system of apartheid, having regard also to its destabilizing effects on the outside. The Member States (and/or, where appropriate, the Community itself) and the ACP States will continue to ensure, through the legal or administrative measures which they have or will have adopted, that migrant workers, students and other foreign nationals legally within their territory are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of racial, religious, cultural os social differences, notably in respect of housing, education, health care, other social services and employment. 3. At the request of the ACP States, financial resources may be allocated, in accordance with the rules governing development finance cooperation, to the promotion of human rights in the ACP States through specific schemes, public or private, that would be decided, particularly in the legal sphere, in consultation with bodies of internationally recognized competence in the field. Resources may also be given to support the establishment of structures to promote human rights. Priority shall be given to schemes of regional scope. ARTICLE 6. 1. With a view to attaining more balanced and self-reliant economic development in the ACP States, special efforts shall be made under this Convention to promote rural development, food security for the people, rational management of natural resources, and the preservation, revival and strengthening of agricultural production potential in the ACP States. 2. The Contracting Parties recognize that priority must be given to environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources, which are essential conditions for sustainable and balanced development from both the economic and human viewpoints. ARTICLE 7. The Community and the ACP States shall give special importance and high priority to regional cooperation and integration. In this context, the Convention shall offer effective support for the ACP States' efforts to organize themselves into regional groupings and to step up their cooperation at regional and inter-regional level with a view to promoting a new, more just and more balanced economic order. ARTICLE 8. The Contracting Parties acknowledge the need to accord special treatment to the least-developed ACP States and to take account of the specific difficulties confronting the landlocked and island ACP States. They shall pay special attention to improving the living conditions of the poorest sections. of the population. Cooperation shall comprise, inter alia, special treatment when determining the volume of financial resources and the conditions attached thereto in order to enable the least-developed ACP States to overcome structural and other obstacles to their development. For the landlocked and island ACP States, cooperation shall be aimed at devising and encouraging specific operations to deal with development problems caused by their geographical situations. ARTICLE 9. In order to step up the effectiveness of the instruments of this Convention, the Contracting Parties shall adopt, in the framework of their respective responsibilities, guidelines, priorities and measures conducive to attaining the objectives set out in this Convention and agree to pursue, in accordance with the principles set out in Article 2, the dialogue within joint institutions and in the coordinated implementation of development finance cooperation and the other cooperation instruments. ARTICLE 10. The Contracting Parties shall, each as far as it is concerned in the framework of this Convention, take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising from this Convention and to facilitate the pursuit of its objectives. They shall refrain from any measures liable to jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of this Convention. ARTICLE 11. Within the scope of their respective responsibilities, the institutions of this Convention shall examine periodically the results of the application thereof, provide any necessary impetus and take any relevant decision or measure for the attainment of its objectives. Any question that might directly hamper the effective attainment of the objectives of this Convention may be raised in the context of the institutions. Consultations shall take place within the Council of Ministers at the request of either Contracting Party in cases provided for in this Convention or where difficulties arise with the application or interpretation thereof. ARTICLE 12. Where the Community intends, in the exercise of its powers, to take a measure which might affect the interests of the ACP States as far as this Convention's objectives are concerned, it shall inform in good time the said States of its intentions. Towards this end, the Commission shall communicate regularly to the Secretariat of the ACP States any proposals for such measures. Where necessary, a request for information may also take place on the initiative of the ACP States. At their request, consultations shall be held in good time so that account may be taken of their concerns as to the impact of those measures before any final decision is made. After such consultations have taken place, the ACP States shall also be provided with adequate information on the entry into force of such decisions, in advance whenever possible. Chapter 2. Objectives and Guidelines of the Convention In the Main Areas of Cooperation ARTICLE 13. Cooperation shall be aimed at supporting development in the ACP States, a process centred on man himself and rooted in each people's culture. It shall back up the policies and measures adopted by those States to enhance their human resources, increase their own creative capacities and promote their cultural identities. Cooperation shall also encourage participation by the population in the design and execution of development operations. Account shall be taken, in the various fields of cooperation, and at all the different stages of the operations executed, of the cultural dimension and social implications of such operations and of the need for both men and women to participate and benefit on equal terms. ARTICLE 14. Cooperation shall entail mutual responsibility for preservation of the natural heritage. In particular, it shall attach special importance to environmental protection and the preservation and restoration of natural equilibria in the ACP States. Cooperation schemes in all areas shall therefore be designed to make the objectives of economic growth compatible with development that respects natural equilibria and brings about lasting results in the service of man. In the framework of efforts to protect the environment and restore natural balances, cooperation shall help promote specific operations concerning the conservation of natural resources, renewable and non-renewable, the protection of ecosystems and the control of drought, desertification and deforestation; other operations on specific themes shall also be undertaken (notably locust control, the protection and utilization of water resources, the preservation of tropical forests and biological diversity, the promotion of a better balance between urban and rural areas, and the urban environment). ARTICLE 15. Agricultural cooperation shall be aimed at the pursuit of food self-sufficiency and food security in the ACP States, developing and organizing their productive systems, improving the living standards and conditions and the life-styles of the rural population and achieving the balanced development of rural areas. Operations in this field shall be designed and executed to support the agricultural and food policies or strategies adopted by the ACP States. ARTICLE 16. Cooperation in the field of mining and energy shall be directed at promoting and expediting, in the mutual interest, diversified economic development, deriving full benefit from the ACP States' human potential: and natural resources, and at fostering better integration of these and other sectors and their complementarity with the rest of the economy. Cooperation shall be aimed at creating and consolidating the cultural, social and economic environment and the infrastructure required to achieve that objective. Support shall be provided for the ACP States' efforts to devise and implement energy: policies suited to their situation, notably the gradual reduction of the dependence of the majority of them on imported petroleum products and the development of new and renewable sources of energy. Cooperation shall be aimed at encouraging improved exploitation of energy and mining resources by taking account of the energy component in the development of the different economic and social sectors and thus helping to improve living conditions and the environment, leading to the better conservation of biomass resources, particularly fuelwood. ARTICLE 17. The Community and the ACP States acknowledge that industrialization is a driving force complementary to agricultural and rural development in promoting the economic transformation of the ACP States in order to achieve self-sustained growth and balanced and diversified development. Industrial development is needed to enhance the productivity of the ACP economies so that they can meet basic human needs and step up the competitive participation of the ACP States in world trade by way of selling more value-added products. ARTICLE 18. Given the extreme dependence of the economies of the vast majority of ACP States on their export of commodities, the Contracting Parties agree to pay particular attention to their cooperation in this sector with a view to supporting ACP States' policies or strategies designed: - on the one hand, to foster diversification, both horizontal and vertical, of the ACP economies, in particular through the development of processing, marketing, distribution and transport (PMD), and - on the other hand, to improve the competitiveness of the ACP States' commodities on world markets through the reorganization and rationalization of their production, marketing and distribution activities. ARTICLE 19. The aim of cooperation in fisheries shall be to help the ACP States to develop their fishery resources in order to expand production for domestic consumption as part of their efforts to achieve increased food security and increase production for export. Such cooperation shall be designed to serve the mutual interests of the Parties, in accordance with their fishery policies. Chapter 3. Widening Participation In Cooperation Activities ARTICLE 20. In accordance with Articles 2, 3 and 13 and in order to encourage all parties from the ACP States and the Community which are in a position to contribute to the autonomous development of the ACP States to put forward and implement initiatives, cooperation shall also support, within limits laid down by the ACP States concerned, development operations put forward by economic, social and cultural organizations in the framework of decentralized cooperation, in particular where they combine the efforts and resources of organizations from the ACP States and their counterparts from the Community. This form of cooperation shall be aimed in particular at making the capabilities, original operating methods and resources of such parties available to the development of the ACP States. The parties referred to in this Article are decentralized public authorities, rural and village groupings, cooperatives, firms, trade unions, teaching and research centres, non-governmental development organizations, various associations and all groups and parties which are able and wish to make their own spontaneous and original contribution to the development of ACP States. ARTICLE 21. Cooperation shall encourage and support the initiatives of the ACP parties referred to in Article 20, provided they correspond with the priorities, guidelines and development methods adopted by the ACP States. In this framework, cooperation shall support either the independent activities of ACP parties or the activities of ACP parties which are combined with support from similar parties from the Community which make their capabilities, experience, technological and organizational capacities or financial resources available to them. Cooperation shall encourage parties from the ACP States and the Community to provide supplementary financial and technical resources for the development effort. Cooperation may provide decentralized cooperation operations with financial and/or technical support drawn from the resources of the Convention under the conditions laid down in Article 22. This form of cooperation shall be organized in accordance with the role and the prerogatives of the public authorities of the ACP States. ARTICLE 22. Decentralized cooperation operations may be supported through the instruments of development finance cooperation, with the approval of the ACP States concerned, preferably from the programming stage, of the principle of and the conditions for providing support for this form of cooperation. Such support shall be provided. to the extent to which it is necessary for the successful implementation of the proposed operations provided the usefulness of the latter has been recognized and in accordance with the provisions for development finance cooperation. Projects under this form of cooperation may be linked, or not, with programmes in the concentration sectors of the indicative programmes with a priority for those linked to the concentration sectors. Chapter 4. Principles Governing the Instruments of Cooperation ARTICLE 23. In order to contribute towards achieving the aims of this Convention, the Contracting Parties shall deploy cooperation instruments that correspond to the principles of solidarity and mutual interest, adapted to the economic, cultural and social situation in the ACP States and in the Community and to developments in their international environment. These instruments shall be directed mainly, by streng- thening the established mechanisms and systems, at: - increasing trade between the Parties, - supporting the ACP States' efforts to achieve self-reliant development by stepping up their capacity to innovate and to adapt and transform technology, - supporting the ACP States' structural adjustment efforts and thus contributing to the attenuation of the debt burden, - helping the ACP States to gain access to the capital markets and encouraging direct private European investment to contribute towards the development of the ACP States, - remedying the instability of export earnings from the ACP States' agricultural commodities and helping those countries to cope with serious disruptions affecting their mining industries. ARTICLE 24. In order to promote and diversify trade between the Contracting Parties, the Community and the ACP States are agreed on: - general trade provisions, - special arrangements for Community import of certain ACP products, - arrangements to promote the development of the ACP States' trade and services, including tourism, - a system of reciprocal information and consultation designed to help apply the trade cooperation provisions of this Convention effectively. ARTICLE 25. The aim of the general trade arrangements, which are based on the Contracting Parties' international obligations, shall be to provide a firm and solid foundation for trade cooperation between the ACP States and the Community. They shall be based on the principle of free access to the Community market for products originating in the ACP States, with special provisions for agricultural products and a safeguard clause. In view of the ACP States' present development needs, the arrangements shall not comprise any element of reciprocity for those States as regards free access. They shall also be based on the principle of non-discrimination by the ACP States between the Member States and the according to the Community of treatment no less favourable than the most-favoured-nation treatment. ARTICLE 26. The Community shall contribute towards the ACP States' own development efforts by providing adequate financial resources and appropriate technical assistance aimed at stepping up those States' capacities for self-reliant and integrated economic, social and cultural development and also at helping to raise their populations' standard of living and well-being, and promote and mobilize resources in support of sustainable, effective and growth-oriented structural adjustment programmes. Such contributions shall be made on a more predictable and continuous basis. They shall be provided at very highly concessional terms. Particular account shall be taken of the situation of the least-developed ACP States. ARTICLE 27. The Contracting Parties agree to facilitate greater, more stable flows of resources from the private sector to the ACP States by taking measures to improve the access of ACP States to capital markets and to encourage European private investment in ACP States. The Contracting Parties underline the need to promote, protect, finance and support investment and to provide equitable and stable conditions for the treatment of such investment. ARTICLE 28. The Contracting Parties agree to confirm the importance of the system for the stabilization of export earnings, as well as of intensifying the process of consultation between the ACP States and the Community in international fora and organizations which aim to stabilize agricultural commodity markets. Given the role played by the mining industry in the development efforts of numerous ACP States and the ACP-EEC mutual dependence in that sector, the Contracting Parties confirm the importance of the system established to help ACP States confronted with serious disruptions in that sector to restore it to a viable state and remedy the consequences of such disruptions for their development. Chapter 5. Institutions ARTICLE 29. The institutions of this Convention shall be the Council of Ministers, the Committee of Ambassadors and the Joint Assembly. ARTICLE 30. 1. The Council of Ministers shall be composed, on the one hand, of the members of the Council of the European Communities and of members of the Commission of the European Communities and, on the other hand, of a member of the government of each of the ACP States. 2. The functions of the Council of Ministers shall be to: (a) establish the broad lines of the work to be undertaken in the context of the application of this Convention, notably in helping to solve problems fundamental to the joint and several development of the Contracting Parties; (b) take any political decision for the attainment of the objectives of this Convention; (c) take decisions in the specific areas provided for in this Convention; (d) ensure efficient performance of the consultation mechanisms provided for in this Convention; (e) deal with problems of interpretation of √Ç¬© this Convention; (f) settle procedural questions and arrangements for the implementation of this Convention; (g) examine, at the request of one of the Contracting Parties, any question directly liable to hinder or promote the effective and efficient implementation of this Convention or any other issue likely to obstruct attainment of its objectives; (h) take all necessary measures to establish ongoing contacts between the economic, cultural and social development bodies in the Community and in the ACP States and to arrange regular consultations with their representatives on matters of mutual interest, given the importance, acknowledged by the Contracting Parties, of establishing an effective dialogue between these bodies and of securing their contribution to the cooperation and development effort. ARTICLE 31. 1. The Committee of Ambassadors shall be composed, on the one hand, of each Member State's Permanent Representative to the European Communities and one representative of the Commission and, on the other, of the head of each ACP State's mission to the European Communities. 2. The Committee of Ambassadors shall assist the Council of Ministers in the performance of its functions and shall carry out any brief given to it by the Council. It shall monitor implementation of this Convention and progress towards achieving the objectives set therein. ARTICLE 32. 1. The Joint Assembly shall be composed of equal numbers of, on the one hand, members of the European Parliament on the Community side and of, on the other, members of parliament or, failing this, of representatives designated by the ACP States. 2. (a) The Joint Assembly shall be a consultative body, which shall seek, through dialogue, debate and concerted action, to: - promote better understanding between the peoples of the Member States and the ACP States, - promote public awareness of the interdependence of the peoples and of their interests as well as of the need for solidarity in development, - reflect upon all matters pertaining to ACP-EEC cooperation, particularly the fundamental problems of development, - encourage research and initiative, and formulate proposals with a view to improving and reinforcing ACP-EEC cooperation, - urge the relevant authorities of the Contracting Parties to implement this Convention in the most efficient manner possible so as to ensure the full attainment of its objectives; (b) the Joint Assembly shall organize regular contacts and consultations with representatives of economic, cultural and social development bodies √¢in the ACP States and in the Community in order to obtain their views on the attainment of the objectives of this Convention. Part Two. THE AREAS OF ACP-EEC COOPERATION Title I. ENVIRONMENT ARTICLE 33. In the framework of this Convention, the protection and the enhancement of the environment and natural resources, the halting of the deterioration of land and forests, the restoration of ecological balances, the preservation of natural resources and their rational exploitation are basic objectives that the ACP States concerned shall strive to achieve with Community support with a view to bringing an immediate improvement in the living conditions of their populations and to safeguarding those of future generations. ARTICLE 34. The ACP States and the Community recognize that the existence of some ACP States is under threat as a result of a rapid deterioration of the environment that hinders any development efforts, in particular those aimed at achieving the priority objectives of food self-sufficiency and food security. For many ACP States efforts to halt this deterioration of the environment and conserve natural resources are imperative and call for the preparation and implementation of coherent modes of development that have due regard for ecological balances. ARTICLE 35. The dimension of the environmental problem and of the means to be deployed mean that operations will have to be carried out in the context of overall, long-term policies, drawn up and implemented by the ACP States at national, regional and international level with international support. To this end, the Parties agree to give priority in their activities to: - preventive approach aimed at avoiding harmful effects on the environment as a result of any programme or operation, - a systematic approach that will ensure ecological viability at all stages, from identification to implementation, - a trans-sectoral approach that takes into account not only the direct but also the indirect consequences of the operations undertaken. ARTICLE 36. The protection of the environment and natural resources requires a comprehensive approach embracing the social and cultural dimensions. In order to ensure that this specific dimension shall be taken into account, attention shall be given to incorporating suitable educational, training, information and research schemes in projects and programmes. ARTICLE 37. Cooperation instruments appropriate to environmental needs shall be designed and implemented. Where necessary, both qualitative and quantitative criteria may be used. Jointly approved check-lists shall be used to help estimate the environmental viability of proposed operations, whatever their scale. Environmental impact assessment will be carried out as appropriate in the case of large-scale projects and those posing a significant threat to the environment. For the proper integration of environmental considerations, physical inventories, where possible translated into accounting terms, shall be drawn up. The implementation of these instruments has to ensure that, should an adverse environmental impact be foreseen, the necessary corrective measures are formulated in the early stage of the preparation of the proposed project or programme so that it can go ahead in accordance with the planned timetable though improved in terms of environmental and natural resource protection. ARTICLE 38. The Parties, desirous of bringing real protection and effective management to the environment and natural resources, consider that the areas of ACP-EEC cooperation covered in Part Two of this Convention shall be systematically examined and appraised in this light. In this spirit the Community shall support efforts made by the ACP States at national, regional and international level and also operations mounted by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in furtherance of national and intergovernmental policies and priorities. ARTICLE 39. 1. The Contracting Parties undertake, for their part, to make every effort to ensure that international movements of hazardous waste and radioactive waste are generally controlled, and they emphasize the importance of efficient international cooperation in this area. With this in view, the Community shall prohibit all direct or indirect export of such waste to the ACP States while at the same time the ACP States shall prohibit the direct or indirect import into their territory of such waste from the Community or from any other country, without prejudice to specific international undertakings to which the Contracting Parties have subscribed or may subscribe in the future in these two areas within the competent international fora. These provisions do not prevent a Member State to which an ACP State has chosen to export waste for processing from returning the processed waste to the ACP State of origin. The Contracting Parties shall expedite adoption of the necessary internal legislation and administrative regu- lations to implement this undertaking. At the request of one of the Parties, consultations may be held if delays are encountered. At the conclusion of such consultations each Party may take appropriate steps in the light of the situation. 2. The Parties undertake to monitor strictly the implementation of the prohibition measures referred to in the second paragraph of paragraph 1. Should difficulties arise in this respect, consultations may be held subject to the same conditions as those provided for in the second paragraph of paragraph 1 and with the same effect. 3. The term "hazardous waste" within the meaning of this Article shall cover categories of products listed in Annexes 1 and 2 to the Basle Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. As regards radioactive waste, the applicable definitions and thresholds shall be those which will be laid down in the framework of the IAEA. In the meantime, the said definitions and thresholds shall be those specified in the declaration in Annex VIII to this Convention. ARTICLE 40. At the request of the ACP States, the Community shall provide available technical information on pesticides and other chemical products with a view to helping them develop or reinforce a suitable and safe use of these products. Where necessary and in accordance with the provisions for development finance cooperation, technical assistance can be given in order to ensure conditions of safety at all stages, from production to disposal of such products. ARTICLE 41. The Parties recognize the value of exchanging views, using existing consultation mechanisms under this Convention, on major ecological hazards, whether on a planetary scale (such as the greenhouse effect, the deter- ioration of the ozone layer, tropical forests, etc.), or of a more specific scope resulting from the application of industrial technology. Such consultations may be requested by either Party, insofar as these hazards may in practice affect the Contracting Parties, and will be aimed at assessing the scope for joint action to be undertaken within the terms of this Convention. If necessary, the consultations will also provide for an exchange of views prior to discussions conducted on these subjects in the appropriate international fora. Title II. AGRICULTURAL COOPERATION, FOOD SECURITY AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT Chapter 1. Agricultural Cooperation and Food Security ARTICLE 42. Cooperation in the agricultural and rural sector, that is arable farming, livestock production, fisheries and forestry, shall be aimed, inter alia, at: - continuously and systematically promoting viable and sustainable development based in particular on protection of the environment and the rational management of natural resources, - supporting the ACP States' efforts to increase their degree of self-sufficiency in food, in particular by strengthening the capacity of the ACP States to provide their populations with food of adequate quantity and quality and to ensure a satisfactory level of nutrition, - reinforcing food security at national, regional and inter-regional level by stimulating regional trade flows of food products and improving coordination of the food policies of the countries concerned, - guaranteeing the rural population incomes that will significantly improve their standard of living, in order to be able to cover their essential needs in the areas of food, education, health and living conditions, - encouraging the active participation of the rural population, both men and women, in their own development by organizing small farmers into associations, and integrating producers, men and women, more effectively into national and_ international economic activity, - increasing the participation of women in their capacity as producers, notably by improving access to all factors of production (land, inputs, credit, extension services and training), - creating satisfactory living conditions and a satisfactory life-style in the rural environment, notably by developing social and cultural activities, - improving rural productivity, notably by transfers of appropriate technology and the rational exploitation of plant and animal resources, - reducing post-harvest losses, - reducing the workload of women by, inter alia, promoting suitable post-harvest and food-processing technologies, - diversifying job-creating rural activities and expanding activities that back up production, - improving production by on-the-spot processing of the products of arable and livestock farming, fisheries and forestry, - ensuring a better balance between food crops and export crops, - developing and strengthening agricultural research tailored to the natural and human environment of the country and the region and meeting extension service and food security requirements, - in the context of the above objectives, protecting the natural environment particularly through specific operations to protect and conserve ecosystems and to fight against drought, desertification and deforestation. ARTICLE 43. 1. Operations to attain the objectives referred to in Article 42 shall be as varied and practical as possible, at national, regional and inter-regional level. 2. They shall, furthermore, be designed and deployed to implement the policies and strategies established by the ACP States and respect their priorities. 3. Support shall be provided for such policies and strategies in the context of agricultural cooperation in accordance with the provisions of this Convention. ARTICLE 44. 1. Development of production calls for a rational stepping up of animal and crop production and involves: - improving farming methods for rain-fed crops while conserving soil fertility, - developing irrigated crops, inter alia through different types of agricultural water schemes (village water engineering, regulation of watercourses and soil improvement) ensuring optimum use and thrifty management of water which can be mastered by farmers and by local communities; operations shall also consist in the rehabilitation of existing schemes, - improving and modernizing cultivation techniques and making better use of factors of production (improved varieties and breeds, agricultural equipment, fertilizers, plant treatment preparations), - in the sphere of livestock farming, improving animal feed (more effective management of pasture, increased fodder production, more new water-points and repair of existing ones) and animal health, including the development of the infrastructure required for that purpose, - better integration of arable and livestock farming; - in the sphere of fisheries, modernizing fish-farming and developing aquaculture. 2. Other prerequisites for the development of production are: - the extension of secondary and tertiary back-up activities for agriculture, such as the manufacture, modernization and promotion of agricultural and rural equipment and. other inputs and, where necessary, their importation, - the establishment or consolidation of agricultural savings and credit facilities adapted to local conditions in order to promote access to production factors for farmers, - the encouragement of all those policies and incentives for producers which are appropriate to local conditions with a view to greater productivity and to. improving farmer's incomes. ARTICLE 45. In order to ensure a return on output, agricultural cooperation shall contribute to: - adequate means of preservation and suitable storage facilities for producers, - effective control of disease, pests and other factors causing production losses, - basic marketing arrangements underpinned by suitable organization of producers, with the necessary material and financial resources, and by adequate means of communication, - flexible operation of marketing channels, taking account of every form of public or private initiative, to enable local markets, areas of the country with shortfalls and urban markets to be supplied, in order to cut down dependence on outside sources, - facilities to prevent breaks in supplies (security storage) and guard against erratic price fluctuations (intervention storage), - processing, packaging and marketing of products, particularly by developing artisanal and agro-industrial units, in order to adapt them to the trend of the market.

However, the prior consultations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not prevent any immediate decisions which the Community or its Member States, in accordance with Article 177 (1), might take where special factors have necessitated such decisions. 4, In order to facilitate the examination of factors that may cause market disturbances, a mechanism shall be instituted for the statistical surveillance of certain ACP exports to the Community. 5. The Contracting Parties undertake to hold regular consultations with a view to finding satisfactory solutions to problems which might result from the application of the safeguard clause. 6. The prior consultations as well as the regular consultations and the surveillance mechanism referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 shall be implemented in accordance with Protocol 4. ARTICLE 179. The Council of Ministers shall, at the request of any Contracting Party concerned, consider the economic and social effects of the application of the safeguard clause. ARTICLE 180. When safeguard measures are being taken, modified or removed, particular attention shall be paid to the interests of the least-developed, landlocked and island ACP States. ARTICLE 181. In order to ensure the effective implementation of this Convention in the field of trade and customs cooperation, the Contracting Parties agree to inform and consult each other. In addition to the cases for which consultations are specifically provided for in Articles 167 to 180, consultations shall also take place, at the request of the Community or of the ACP States, and in accordance with the conditions provided for in the procedural rules in Articles 12, particularly in the following cases: (1) where Contracting Parties intend to take any trade measures affecting the interests of one or more Contracting Parties under this Convention, they shall inform the Council of Ministers thereof. Consultations shall take place, where the Contracting Parties concerned so request, in order to take account of their respective interests; (2) if, during the application of this Convention, the ACP States consider that agricultural products covered by Article 168 (2) (a) other than those subject to special treatment should benefit from such treatment, consultations may take place within the Council of Ministers; (3) where a Contracting Party considers that obstacles to the movement of goods arise as a result of the existing rules of another Contracting Party or the interpretation, application or administration thereof; (4) where the Community or the Member States take safeguard measures in accordance with Article 177, consultations on these measures may take place within the Council of Ministers, where the Contracting Parties concerned so request, notably with a view to ensuring compliance with Article 177 (3). Such consultations must be completed within three months. Chapter 2. Special Undertakings on Rum and Bananas ARTICLE 182. Until the entry into force of a common organization of the market in spirits and notwithstanding Article 167 (1), entry into the Community of products of subheadings 2208 40 10, 2208 4090, 22089011 and 22089019 of the combined nomenclature - rum, arrack, taffia - originating in the ACP States shall be governed by Protocol 6.

The ACP States and the Community recognize that the long-term aim in this area is a progressive liberalization of trade in services, with due respect for national policy objectives, and taking due account of the level of development of ACP States. 3. The ACP States and the Community recognize further that it will be opportune and necessary to develop cooperation in this sector when the outcome of current multilateral trade negotiations is known. 4. Therefore, the Contracting Parties will negotiate amendments or further elaboration of this Convention to take account, and to take advantage, of the outcome of the multilateral trade negotiations in the GATT. 5. Following the negotiations referred to in paragraph 4, which will take place within the framework of the Council of Ministers, the Council of Ministers may adopt any amendment to this Chapter. Title II. COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF COMMODITIES Chapter 1. Stabilization of Export Earnings from Agricultural Commodities ARTICLE 186. 1. With the aim of remedying the harmful effects of the instability of export earnings and to help the ACP States overcome one of the main obstacles to the stability, profitability and sustained growth of their economies, to support their development efforts and to enable them in this way to ensure economic and social progress for their peoples by helping to safeguard their purchasing power, a system shall be operated to guarantee the stabilization of export earnings derived from the ACP States' exports to the Community or other destinations as defined in Article 189, of products on which their economies are dependent and which are affected by fluctuations in price or quantity or both these factors. 2. In order to attain these objectives, transfers shall be devoted, in accordance with a framework of mutual obligations to be agreed between the ACP State concerned and the Commission in each case, either to the sector, interpreted in the widest possible sense, that recorded the loss of export earnings and be used there for the benefit of economic operators adversely affected by this loss, or, where appropriate, to diversification, either for use in other appropriate productive sectors in principle agricultural, or for the processing of agricultural products. ARTICLE 187. 1. The following products shall be covered: 2. In all cases of application of the system, the Commission shall, in the interests of the ACP State concerned, consider as products within the meaning of this chapter: (a) each product listed in paragraph 1; (b) product groups 1 and 2, 3 to 7, 8 and 9, 10 and 11, 12 to 14, 15 to 17, 18 to 21, 22 and 23, 24 and 25, 47 and 48. ARTICLE 188. If, 12 months after the entry into force of this Convention, one or more products not contained in the list in Article 187 but upon which the economies of one or more ACP States depend to a considerable extent are affected by sharp fluctuations, the Council of Ministers shall decide, not more than six months after the presentation of a request by the ACP State or States concerned whether or not to include the said product or products in the list, taking account of factors such as employment, deterioration of the terms of trade between the Community and the ACP State concerned, the level of development of the ACP State concerned and the conditions which characterize products originating in the Community. ARTICLE 189. 1. The system shall apply to earnings from exports: (a) by each ACP State to the Community of each product referred to in Article 187 (2); (b) by the ACP States benefiting from the derogation referred to in paragraph 2 to the other ACP States of each product referred to in Article 187 (2) for which such derogation has been granted; (c) by the ACP States benefiting from the derogation referred to in paragraph 3 to all destinations of each product referred to in Article 187 (2). 2. At the request of one or more ACP States in respect of one or more of the products referred to in Article 187 (1), the Council of Ministers may decide, after examination of a report established by the Commission on the basis of the relevant information provided by the requesting ACP State or States, and not more than six months after the presentation of the request, to apply the system to exports of the products in question from the said ACP State or States to other ACP States. 3. If, on the basis of relevant data for the average of the two years preceding the application year, at least 70% of an ACP State's total export earnings from products covered by the system do not come from exports to the Community, the system shall be automatically applied to its exports of each of the products referred to in Article 187 (2), whatever the destination. In the case of the least-developed ACP States this percentage shall be 60 %. For each year of application and for each ACP State, the Commission shall check that these criteria have been fulfilled. ARTICLE 190. For the purposes stipulated in Article 186 and for the duration of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention, the amount provided for in that protocol shall be allocated to the system. This amount shall cover all commitments under the system. It shall be managed by the Commission. ARTICLE 191. 1. The overall amount referred to in Article 190 shall be divided into a number of equal annual instalments corresponding to the number of years of application of the Financial Protocol. 2. Whatever balance remains at the end of each year of application of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention except the last shall be carried forward automatically to the following year. ARTICLE 192. Interest earned by investment in the market, over the period from 1 April to 30 June, of the sum equivalent to half each annual instalment, minus any advances and transfers paid during that period, shall be credited to the system's resources. Interest earned by investment-in the market, over the period from 1 July to 31 March, of the sum equivalent to the second half of each annual instalment, minus any advances and transfers paid during that second period, shall be credited to the system's resources. Any part of an annual instalment which has not been advanced or transferred shall continue to bear interest which will be added to the system's resources until its utilization in the following year. ARTICLE 193. The resources available for each year of application are made up of the sum of the following: (1) the annual instalment, plus any amounts available or less any amounts used under Article 194 (1); (2) the sums carried forward under Article 191 (2); (3) the amount of interest earned pursuant to Article 192. ARTICLE 194. 1. If the total amount of the transfer bases in a year of application, calculated in accordance with Article 197, and where appropriate reduced in accordance with Articles 202 to 204, exceeds the amount of resources available in the system for that year, advance use shall be made automatically, for each year except the last, of a maximum of 25 % of the following year's instalment. 2. If, after the operation referred to in paragraph 1, the amount of resources available is still less than the total amount of the transfer bases referred to in paragraph 1 for the same year of application, the amount of each transfer basis shall be reduced by 10 % of that amount. 3. If, after the reduction referred to in paragraph 2, the total amount of the transfers so calculated is less than the amount of resources available, the remainder shall be shared among all the transfers in proportion to the amounts by which each transfer was reduced. 4. If, after the reduction referred to in paragraph 2, the total amount of the transfers which may give rise to a payment exceeds the amount of available resources, the Council of Ministers shall evaluate the situation on the basis of a Commission report on the probable development of the system and shall examine the steps to be taken to remedy that situation, within the terms of this Convention. ARTICLE 195. In the case of any balance remaining from the overall amount referred to in Article 190, including the interest referred to in Article 192 after the expiry of the last year of administration of the system under the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention: (a) the amounts resulting from the application of the percentages referred to in Article 197 (3) and (4) shall be repaid to each ACP State in proportion to the deduction or deductions made in application of those provisions; (b) if any balance remains after application of (a), the Council of Ministers shall decide on its use. ARTICLE 196. 1. The system shall apply to the earnings from an ACP State's exports of the products referred to in Article 187 (2) if, during the year preceding the year of application, earnings from the export of each product to all destinations, re-exports excluded, represented at least 5 % of its total earnings from exports of all goods. The percentage shall be 4 % in the case of sisal. 2. For the least-developed, landlocked and island ACP States, the percentage referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 1%. 3. Where, following a natural disaster, a substantial fall in production of the product in question is recorded during the year preceding the year of application, the percentage referred to in paragraph 1 shall be calculated on the basis of the average export earnings from that product during the three years preceding the year of the disaster. A substantial fall in production shall be taken to mean at least 50 % of the average production during the three years preceding the year of the disaster. ARTICLE 197. 1. In order to implement the system, a reference level and a transfer basis shall be calculated for each ACP State and for exports of each product referred to in Article 187 (1) to the Community or other destinations as defined in Article 189. 2. The reference level shall be constituted by the average of export earnings during the period of the six calendar years preceding each year of application less the two years with the highest and lowest figures. 3. The transfer basis shall be constituted by the difference between the reference level and actual earnings in the calendar year of application, reduced by an amount corresponding to 4,5 % of the reference level. In the case of the least-developed ACP States, this percentage shall be 1%. 4. The reductions referred to in paragraph 3 shall not apply in the case of the least-developed or landlocked ACP States if the difference between the reference level and actual earnings is less than ECU 2 million, or in the case of island ACP States if this difference is less than ECU 1 million. In no case shall the reduction of the difference between the reference level and actual earnings be greater than: - 20% for the least-developed and for landlocked ACP States, - 30% for other ACP States. 5. The amount of the transfer shall be the transfer basis after application, where relevant, of Articles 202 to 204 and 194, ARTICLE 198. 1. Where an ACP State: - begins processing a product traditionally exported in the raw state, or - begins exporting a product which it did not traditionally produce, the system may be put into operation on the basis of a reference level calculated over the three years preceding the year of application. 2. In the case of the ACP States accorded the derogation: - referred to in Article 189 (2), the transfer basis shall be calculated by adding to the earnings from exports of the product or products concerned to the Community the earnings from exports of those products to other ACP States; - referred to in Article 189 (3), the transfer basis shall be calculated according to the earnings from exports of the product or products concerned to all destinations. ARTICLE 199. 1. In order to ensure that the system functions efficiently and rapidly, statistical cooperation shall be instituted between each ACP State and the Commission. 2. The ACP States shall notify the Commission of the annual statistical data specified in the joint declaration in Annex XLII. 3. This information must be sent to the Commission not later than 31 March in the year following that of application. Failure to do so shall result in the ACP State concerned losing all transfer rights in relation to the product or products in question for the relevant year of application. ARTICLE 200. The system shall be implemented in respect of the products listed In Article 187 where they are: (a) released for home use in the Community, or (b) brought into the Community under the inward processing arrangements in order to be processed. 2. The statistics to be used to carry out the calculations referred to in Article 197 shall be those calculated and published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities. : 3. In the case of ACP States accorded the derogation (a) referred to in Article 189 (2), the statistics relating to exports of the product or products in question to other ACP States shall be the volume exported by the ACP State concerned multiplied by the average unit value of imports by the Community as calculated and published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities or, failing those, the statistics of the ACP State concerned; (b) referred to in Article 189 (3), the statistics relating to exports of the product or products in question to all destinations shall be the volume exported by the ACP State concerned multiplied by the average unit value of imports by the Community as calculated and published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities or, failing those, the statistics of the ACP State concerned. 4. Should there be significant differences between the statistics of the Statistical Office of the European Communities and those of the ACP State concerned, consultation shall be held between that ACP State and the Commission. ARTICLE 201. No transfer shall take place if it emerges from the examination of the dossier to be undertaken by the Commission in conjunction with the ACP State concerned that the fall in earnings from exports to the Community is the result of measures or policies involving discrimination detrimental to the Community. ARTICLE 202. The transfer basis shall be reduced in due proportion to the fall in earnings from exports to the Community of the product in question if, after joint examination by the Commission and the ACP State concerned, it appears that such a drop is the consequence of trade-policy measures taken by the ACP State or through its economic operators with the aim of restricting supply; such reduction may entail the annulment of the transfer basis. ARTICLE 203. Should examination of the trend of the ACP State's exports, to all destinations, of production of the product in question in the ACP State concerned and of demand in the Community reveal significant changes, consultations shall take place between the Commission and that ACP State to determine whether the transfer basis is to be maintained or reduced, and, if so, to what extent. ARTICLE 204. In no case shall any transfer basis for a given product be greater than the corresponding amount calculated on the basis of the exports of the ACP State concerned to all destinations. ARTICLE 205. 1. The Commission shall adopt a transfer decision on completion of the examination carried out in conjunction with the ACP State; this examination shall bear on the statistical data and the calculation of the transfer basis which may give rise to a payment. 2. For each transfer a transfer agreement shall be concluded between the Commission and the ACP State concerned. ARTICLE 206. 1. The ACP State concerned and the Commission shall take such steps as are required to ensure that advances and transfers are made rapidly in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 207. 2. ARTICLE 205 shall be applicable by analogy to advances. ARTICLE 207. 1. Provided that the ACP State concerned has sent all the necessary statistical information by 31 March in the year following that of application, in accordance with Article 199 (3), the Commission shall notify each ACP State not later than 30 April following of its situation in respect of each of the products listed in Article 187 (2) exported by that State during that year. 2. The ACP State concerned and the Commission shall take all possible steps to ensure that the procedures referred to in Articles 201 to 203 are concluded not later than 30 June of the year in question. After this period has elapsed, the Commission shall notify the ACP States of the amount of the transfer resulting from appraisal of the dossier. 3. Without prejudice to Article 206 and not later than 31 July of the year in question the Commission shall take decisions concerning all transfers, except for those where consultations have not been concluded. 4. On 30 September of the year in question the Commission shall report to the Committee of Ambassadors on the progress made with the processing of all transfers. ARTICLE 208. 1. In the event of a disagreement between an ACP State and the Commission over the results of the examinations or consultations referred to in Articles 201 to 203 and 199 (3), the ACP State concerned shall have the right to initiate, without prejudice to possible recourse to Article 352, a good offices procedure. 2. The good offices procedure shall be carried out by an expert appointed by agreement between the Commission and the ACP State concerned. 3. Within two months of this appointment, the conclusions of the procedure shall be communicated to the ACP State concerned and to the Commission, which shall take account of them in making the transfer decision. The ACP State concerned and the Commission shall take all possible steps to ensure that the decision is taken not later than 31 October following receipt of the request, 4. The procedure shall not result in a delay in the processing of any other transfers for the same year of application. ARTICLE 209. 1. Where application of Articles 196 and 197 gives rise to a transfer basis, the ACP State concerned shall, in the month following receipt of the notification referred to in Article 207 (1), send the Commission a substantial analysis of the sector recording the loss of earnings, the causes of the loss, the policies pursued by the authorities and the projects, programmes and operations to which the recipient State undertakes to allocate the resources in accordance with the objectives set out in Article 186 (2). 2. Should the recipient ACP State intend, as provided for in Article 186 (2), to allocate the funds to a sector other than that where the loss has occurred, it shall communicate to the Commission the reasons for this allocation. 3. Projects, programmes or operations to which the recipient ACP State undertakes to allocate the transferred resources shall be examined jointly by the Commission and the ACP State concerned. 4. Where, in the sector for which the transfer is destined, there is already an adjustment operation designed to restructure production and export activities or to achieve diversification, the resources shall be used to second these efforts and; where necessary, support any consistent reform policy in the sectors concerned. ARTICLE 210. When agreement is reached on the use of resources, the ACP State and the Commission shall sign a protocol setting up a framework of mutual obligations stipulating how the funds are to be used at the various stages of the operations agreed on. ARTICLE 211. 1. The transfer shall be made in ecus upon signature of the transfer agreement referred to in Article 205 (2) into an interestbearing account, for which presentation of two signatures, of the ACP State and the Commission, shall be required. Any interest shall be credited to this account. 2. The funds in the account referred to in paragraph 1 shall be mobilized as the operations specified in the protocol on the use of the funds are implemented, on condition that the provisions of Article 212 have been complied with. 3. The procedures laid down in paragraph 2 shall be applicable by analogy to any counterpart funds generated. ARTICLE 212. 1. Within twelve months of the mobilization of resources the recipient ACP State shall send the Commission a report on the use which it has made of the funds transferred. 2. Should the report referred to in paragraph 1 not be presented within the time limit set or should it call for comment, the Commission shall send a request for substantiation to the ACP State concerned, which shall be obliged to reply thereto within two months. 3. Once the deadline referred to in paragraph 2 has expired, the Commission may, having referred the matter to the Council of Ministers and having duly informed the ACP State concerned, three months after completion of this procedure, suspend application of decisions on subsequent transfers until that State has provided the required information. The ACP State concerned shall be notified of this measure immediately. Chapter 2. Special Undertakings on Sugar ARTICLE 213. 1. In accordance with Article 25 of the ACP-EEC Convention of Lom√© signed on 28 February 1975 and with Protocol 3 annexed thereto, the Community has undertaken for an indefinite period, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, to purchase and import, at guaranteed prices, specific quantities of cane sugar, raw or white, which originates in the ACP States producing and exporting cane sugar and which those States have undertaken to deliver to it 2. The conditions for the implementation of the aforementioned Article 25 have been laid down by Protocol 3 referred to in paragraph 1. The text of the Protocol is annexed to this Convention as Protocol 8. 3. ARTICLE 177 of this Convention shall not apply within the framework of the said Protocol. 4. For the purpose of Article 8 of the said Protocol the institutions established under this Convention may be used during the period of application of this Convention. 5. ARTICLE 8 (2) of the said Protocol shall apply should this Convention cease to be operative. 6. The declarations contained in Annexes XII, XXI and XXII to the Final Act to the ACP-EEC Convention of Lom√© signed on 28 February 1975 are reaffirmed and their provisions shall continue to apply. These declarations are annexed as such to this Convention. 7. This Article and the Protocol 3 referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to relations between the ACP States and the French overseas departments. Chapter 3. Mining Products: Special Financing Facility (Sysmin) ARTICLE 214. 1. A special financing facility shall be set up for those ACP States whose mining sectors occupy an important place in their economies and are facing difficulties that are already perceived or foreseeable in the near future. 2. Its aims are to contribute towards establishing a more solid and wider basis for the development of the ACP States while supporting their efforts: - to safeguard their mining production and export sectors by remedial or preventive action designed to alleviate the serious consequences for their economies of the loss of viability as a result of a decline in their production or export capacity and/or export earnings in the mining products sector following major technological or economic changes or temporary or unforeseeable disruptions beyond the control of the State concerned and of the enterprise managing the sector concerned. Particular attention shall be paid to adjusting the competitive situation of enterprises to changes in market conditions, or - for States heavily dependent on exports of one mining product, to diversify and broaden the bases of their economic growth, notably by helping them complete development projects and programmes under way where these are seriously jeopardized owing to substantial falls in export earnings from that product. 3. In pursuing these objectives, this support: - will be adapted to the economic restructuring needs of the ACP State concerned, - will take into account at the time of its formulation and implementation the mutual interests of the Contracting Parties. ARTICLE 215. 1. The special financing facility provided for in Article 214 shall be aimed at ACP States which export to the Community and which, during at least two of the four years preceding that of the request for aid, have derived either: (a) 15% or more of their export earnings from one of the following products: copper (including cobalt), phosphates, manganese, bauxite and alumina, tin, iron ore, whether or not in agglomerate form, uranium; or (b) 20% or more of their export earnings from all mining products (excluding precious minerals other than gold, oil and gas). However, for least-developed, landlocked or island ACP States, the figure stipulated in (a) shall be 10 % and the figure stipulated in (b) shall be 12 %. For the calculation of the thresholds referred to in (a) and (b) earnings shall not include those from mining products not covered by the system. 2. Recourse to the special financing facility shall be possible where, in the light of the aims referred to above: (a) it is perceived or expected that the viability of one or more enterprises in the mining sector has been or is about to be seriously affected following temporary or unforeseeable difficulties - whether technical, economic or political - beyond the control of the State or undertaking concerned, and where such damage to viability leads to or may lead to a significant fall in revenue for the ACP State concerned - assessed in particular on the basis of a drop in production or export capacities of the product in question of around 10% - and/or a deterioration in its external trade balance. Foreseeable damage to viability shall be characterized by the onset of deterioration of the means of production and its impact on the country's economy; or (b) in cases under paragraph 1 (1), it is perceived that a substantial fall in export earnings from the mining product concerned, in relation to the average for the two years before the request, is seriously jeopardizing the completion of development projects and programmes under way. To be taken into consideration, such a fall in earnings must: - be caused by technical, economic or political difficulties and not artificially provoked, directly or indirectly, by policies and measures of the ACP State or the economic operators concerned, - result in a corresponding fall in total export earnings of approximately 10% at least in the year before that of the request. The said difficulties shall refer to disruptions such as accidents, serious technical incidents, serious internal of external political events, major technological and economic changes or major changes in trade relations with the Community. 3. An ACP State may request financial aid under the special financing facility where the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 are met. ARTICLE 216. 1. The aid referred to in Article 215 shall be used in pursuit of the aims of the facility as set out in Article 214 (2). - Where maintenance or return to viability of the mining enterprise or enterprises affected is deemed possible and appropriate by the two parties, the aid shall be used to finance projects or programmes, including the financial restructuring of the enterprise or enterprises concerned, with a view to maintaining, re-establishing or rationalizing at a viable level the production and export capacity concerned. - Where it is not thought possible by the two parties to maintain or restore viability, the aid shall be used to broaden the bases of economic growth through the financing of viable horizontal or vertical conversion or diversification projects or programmes. - By common agreement, the aim of diversification may also be pursued where the economy is dependent on the mining product in question to a significant degree, even where: viability can be re-established. - Where Article 215 (2) (b) is applicable, the objective of diversification shall be pursued through financial assistance to aid the completion of development projects and programmes under way outside the mining sector which are in jeopardy. 2. Any decision to allocate funds to projects or programmes shall take due account of economic interests and the social implications of such aid in the ACP State concerned and in the Community and will be adapted to the economic restructuring needs of that ACP State. In the case of requests presented under Article 215 (1) (b), the Community and the ACP State concerned shall jointly and systematically seek to establish the scope and the terms of any aid accorded in such a way that such aid does not injure competing Community mining production. The consideration and appraisal of these factors shall be part of the analysis referred to in Article 217 (2). 3. Special attention shall be accorded to: - processing and transport operations, notably at regional level, and the proper integration of the mining sector in the country's overall economic and social development, - preventive operations to minimize any disruptive effects by adapting technology, improving the technical and managerial skills of local staff and adapting the skills of local staff to enterprise management techniques, - stepping up the ACP States' scientific and technical capacity for the production of new materials. ARTICLE 217. 1. The request for aid must include information on the nature of the problems encountered, the perceived or expected consequences of the disruption both at national level and at the level of the mining enterprise or enterprises affected and indications in the form of an identification sheet on the measures or actions undertaken or desired to remedy them. The request shall be made as soon as these consequences are identified and within a period not exceeding 12 months for making up the file. 2. Prior to any Community decision a technical, economic and financial analysis shall be made systematically of the mining sector concerned in order to assess both the eligibility of the request and the project or programme to be undertaken to utilize the aid. That analysis, which shall be very detailed, shall, in order to identify the operation, take particular account of world market prospects and, without prejudice to the first paragraph of Article 216 (2), the situation of the Community market in the products concerned. It shall also include an analysis of the possible implications of such an operation for the competing mining products of Member States and the possible implications of its non-implementation for the ACP State concerned. Its objective shall be to ascertain: - whether the viability of the means of production concerned has been or is likely to be damaged and whether that viability can be restored, or whether recourse to diversification measures is more appropriate, or - whether the fall in export earnings referred to in Article 215 (2) (b) seriously jeopardizes the implementation of development projects and programmes under way. The analysis shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures for financial and technical cooperation. It shall require the close cooperation of the ACP State and economic operators concerned. 3. A single decision shall be taken on eligibility and the financing proposal. The Community and the ACP State concerned shall take the necessary steps to expedite appraisal of requests so that the appropriate action may be taken swiftly. ARTICLE 218. 1. If necessary, technical assistance for setting up and supervising the project may be financed under the facility. 2. The procedures applicable to such assistance and the detailed rules for its implementation shall be those laid down in this Convention for development finance cooperation. ARTICLE 219. 1. For the purposes specified in Article 214 and for the period of application of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention, the Community shall allocate the overall amount provided for in that Protocol to cover all its commitments under this special financing facility. The amount allocated to the facility shall be managed by the Commission. 2. (a) This overall amount shall be divided into a number of equal annual instalments corresponding to the number of years of application. Each year, except the last, the Council of Ministers, on the basis of a report submitted to it by the Commission, may authorize the advance use of up to 50% of the following year's instalment where required. (b) Any balances remaining at the end of each year of application of the Financial Protocol annexed to this Convention, except the last, shall be carried over automatically to the following year. (c) Consequently, the resources available for each year of application will be made up of the following elements: - the annual instalment, less any amounts used under (a); - the sums carried over under (b); (d) If the resources available for any year of application are insufficient, the amounts provided for shall be reduced accordingly, without prejudice to subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c). Before expiry of the period of application of the Financial Protocol, the Council of Ministers shall decide on the allocation of any balances remaining from the overall amount. 3. The amount of the aid provided for in Article 215 shall be determined by the Commission in the light of the funds available under the special financing facility, the nature of the relevant projects and programmes, the possibilities for cofinancing and the relative importance of the mining. industry concerned for the economy of the ACP State. 4. Under no circumstances may a single ACP State be eligible for more than 35 % of the resources available as a result of the application of paragraph 2 (c). The rate shall be 15 % for aid under Article 215 (1) (b). 5.

ARTICLE 234. 1. Risk capital may be provided in the form of loans or equity participation. (a) In the case of loans, it may be provided mainly in the form of: (i) subordinated loans, which shall be redeemed and in respect of which interest, if any, shall be paid only after other claims have been settled; (ii) conditional loans, the servicing and/or the duration of which shall be linked to the fulfilment of certain conditions with regard. to the performance of the project financed such as profit or target output. The specific terms shall be laid down when the loan is made. (b) In the case of equity participation, it may be provided to acquire temporary minority holdings on behalf of the Community in the capital of ACP enterprises or institutions financing development projects in the ACP States or of ACP financial institutions promoting and financing private investment in the ACP States. Such holdings shall be transferred to nationals or institutions of the ACP States or as otherwise agreed with the ACP State concerned, once the conditions specified for the purpose are met. (c) The terms of risk capital operations shall depend on the characteristics of each project or programme financed and shall in general be more favourable than those of subsidized loans. In the case of loans the interest rate shall, in any case, be less than 3 %. 2. In order to minimize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, the problem of exchange rate risk shall be dealt with in the following way: (a) in the case of risk capital operations designed to strengthen an enterprise's own funds the exchange rate risk shall as a general rule be borne by the Community; (b) in the case of risk capital financing for investments of private sector firms and small and medium-sized enterprises, hereinafter referred to as "SMEs", the exchange rate risk shall be shared by the Community, on the one part, and by the other parties involved, on the other.

The rate of subsidy shall be automatically adjusted so that the interest rate borne by the borrower will be neither less than 3% nor more than 6% for a loan contracted at the reference rate. The reference rate adopted for calculating the adjustment in the rate of subsidy shall be the rate for the ECU applied by the Bank for a loan with the same conditions as to duration and repayment on the day of signature of the contract; (c) the amount of the interest rate subsidy calculated in terms of its value at the times of disbursement of the loan shall be charged against the amount of grants and paid directly to the Bank; (d) the duration of loans made by the Bank from its own resources shall be governed by terms stipulated on the basis of the economic and financial characteristics of the project, but may not exceed 25 years. These loans shall normally comprise a grace period fixed by reference to the construction period and the funds needed for the project. ARTICLE 236. The Bank shall: (a) contribute, through the resources it manages, to the economic and industrial development of the ACP States on a national and regional scale; and to this end, finance in the first place, productive projects and programmes in industry, agroindustry, tourism, mining, energy and in transport and telecommunications linked to these sectors.

Special treatment shall be accorded to the least-developed ACP States when determining the volume of the financial resources which such States may expect from the Community for the purpose of their indicative programmes. In addition, account shall be taken of the particular difficulties of the landlocked or island ACP States. Those financial resources shall be combined with more favourable terms of financing, having regard to the economic situation and the nature of the needs specific to each State. They shall consist essentially of grants, and, in appropriate cases, of risk capital or loans from the Bank, having regard in particular to the criteria laid down in Article 233 (2). Section 3. Debt and Structural Adjusement Support ARTICLE 239. Debt 1. The ACP States and the Community share the view that the external debt situation of ACP States has emerged as a major development issue, and that the associated heavy debt-servicing obligations contribute to constraints on import capacity and the level of investments in these States, thus affecting their growth and development. 2. The ACP States and the Community reaffirm their determination to develop and implement in a coordinated and integrated way the different instruments of the Convention and to implement the following measures with a view to contributing to the attenuation of the debt burden of the ACP States and their balance of payment problems with a view to stimulating economic recovery and growth. ARTICLE 240. In order to avoid increases in the debt of ACP States, finance under this Convention, apart from bank loans and risk capital, is provided in the form of grants. Specifically the following measures and actions will be taken: (a) for projects with high rates of return, and in particular for Sysmin financing, a two-stage procedure will be followed whereby ACP States will: receive grants and will on-lend the funds at appropriate market terms and conditions, with suitable arrangements for deposit of interest and repayment, less an agreed service charge, in a counterpart fund account, managed according to normal procedures as agreed for this type of finance generated from Community assistance; (b) Stabex transfers will be granted without any obligation for the beneficiary ACP States to reconstitute the resources of the system. 2. In addition, the Community agrees to: (a) enable, on a case-by-case basis, the acceleration of the use of the resources of past indicative programmes which have not been committed through the quick-disbursing instruments provided for in this Convention in order to contribute to the attenuation of the debt burden; (b) grant, at the request of an ACP State: (i) assistance in studying and finding practical solutions to indebtedness, debt-servicing difficulties and balance of payments problems; (ii) training in external debt management and international financial negotiations as well as support for training workshops, courses and seminars in these fields; (iii) assistance to ACP States in developing flexible techniques and instruments of debt management to deal with unanticipated interest rate and exchange rate variations; (c) encourage its institutions, including the Bank, to play a more active role in catalysing new flows of finance to debtaffected ACP States. ARTICLE 241. The Community commits itself to support the ACP States' efforts to: (a) undertake reforms with a view to improving the performance of the economy; (b) strengthen their external debt management mech- anisms at national level so as to exercise more effective control over external borrowing by the public sector, and monitor private sector borrowing; (c) reverse the outflow of capital; (d) intensify their efforts to reduce inflation and implement measures designed to increase domestic savings; (e) introduce concrete measures to improve the quality of investment in both the public and private sectors; (f) give adequate incentives to projects that generate or save foreign exchange; (g) as a long-term objective, develop subregional capital markets which can serve as effective mechanisms for tapping ACP surplus funds invested abroad; (h) adopt measures aimed at increasing intra-ACP trade through the use of existing subregional and regional payments mechanisms and encourage clearing arrangements and credit insurance in all intra-ACP trade transactions. ARTICLE 242. In order to contribute to the servicing of the debt resulting from Community loans from the Bank's own resources, special loans and risk capital, the ACP States may, in accordance with arrangements to be made on a case-by-case basis with the Commission, use the available foreign currency referred to in Article 319 for such servicing, as and when debt repayment falls due and up to the amount required for payments in national currency. ARTICLE 243. Structural Adjustment Support The ACP States and the Community recognize that the economic and social problems being experienced by ACP States are the result of both internal factors and external developments. They see the need for urgent action and share the view that short and medium-term policies must reinforce the long-term development efforts and goals of ACP States. To this end, they have agreed that the Convention should provide structural adjustment support to assist ACP States in their effort to: (a) create an economic environment favourable to a resumption of, or to an acceleration in, the growth of GDP and employment; (b) improve the social and economic well-being of the population as a whole; (c) improve public sector management and provide appropriate private sector incentives; (d) increase the level of productivity in the key sectors of the economy; (e) achieve greater economic diversification as part of the effort to develop a larger measure of resilience in the economy and to reduce domestic and external imbalances while maintaining GDP growth; (f) improve balance-of-payments performance and the foreign-exchange position; (g) ensure that adjustment is economically viable and socially and politically bearable. ARTICLE 244. Adjustment support shall be administered on the basis of the following principles: (a) the ACP States shall bear primary responsibility for the analysis of the problems to be solved and the preparation of reform programmes; (b) support programmes shall be adapted to the different situation in each ACP State and be sensitive to the social conditions, culture and environment of these States; (c) assistance shall be supportive of the ACP State's priority development objectives such as agricultural and rural development, food security, PMDT and environmental protection, and contribute to the attenuation of the debt burden; (d) adjustment support shall take place within the framework of the political and economic model of the ACP State concerned; (e) the right of the ACP States to determine the direction of their development strategies and priorities shall be recognized and respected; (f) both the reform and the support programme shall make provision from the outset to deal with the negative social effects that may result from the process of adjustment efforts, in pursuit of the objectives of economic growth and social justice, particular attention being paid to the most vulnerable groups in the society including the poor, the unemployed, women and children; (g) the pace of the reform programmes shall be realistic and compatible with each ACP State's capacities and resources, while the implementation of support programmes shall be flexible and adapted to the management capacity of the ACP State concerned; (h) quick disbursement shall be an important feature of support programmes; (i) support shall be given in the context of a joint assessment between the Community and the ACP State concerned on the reform measures being undertaken or contemplated either at a macro-economic or sectoral level. ARTICLE 245. 1. For purposes of structural adjustment support, Community financial assistance shall be given in form of grants: (a) as provided for in Article 1 of the Financial Protocol; and (b) from the indicative programme, in accordance with Article 281 (2) (c). 2. On the expiry of the Financial Protocol, appropriations set aside for structural adjustment support and not committed shall be paid back, save as otherwise decided by the Council of Ministers, to the assets of the Fund for the purpose of financing other operations falling within the scope of development finance cooperation, notably those relating to programmable assistance. ARTICLE 246. 1. All ACP States shall in principle be eligible for structural adjustment assistance depending on the scope of the reforms being undertaken or contemplated at the macroeconomic or sectoral level, their effectiveness, and their likely impact on the economic, social and political dimension of development, and on economic and social hardships being experienced, as reflected, by indicators such as: (a) the level of indebtedness and the debt service burden; (b) balance of payments difficulties; (c) the bidgetary situation; (d) the monetary situation; (e) the rate of growth of real national income; (f) the level of unemployment; (g) the situation in social areas such as nutrition, housing, health and education. 2. ACP States undertaking reform programmes that are acknowledged and supported at least by the principal multilateral donors, or that are agreed with such donors but not necessarily financially supported by them, shall be treated as having automatically satisfied the requirements for adjustment assistance. 3. In assessing the social and economic hardships referred to in paragraph 1, particular attention will be given to the leastdeveloped ACP States. ARTICLE 247. 1. The resources earmarked for structural adjustment support may be mobilized either at the beginning of or during the Financial Protocol period, at the request of the ACP State concerned. 2. Such support for adjustment effort shall take the form of: (a) sectoral or general import programmes in accordance with Articles 224 (c) and 225; (b) technical assistance related to structural adjustment support programmes. 3. In addition, with a view to alleviating the ACP States' domestic financial constraints, counterpart funds generated by various Community instruments may be used in accordance with Article 226. 4. Structural adjustment support shall be implemented flexibly and the instruments chosen on a case-by-case basis. A GIP designed in keeping with the approach to structural adjustment support laid down in the Convention will usually be the most appropriate instrument for countries carrying out macroeconomic reforms. In the case of sectoral adjustment, the assistance will be given in the form of an SIP in kind or in foreign currency. An SIP could also beused in a situation of macro-economic reforms with a view to achieving a greater sectoral impact. ARTICLE 248. The implementation.of each support programme shall: (a) be adapted to the needs of each recipient State; (b) ensure consistency between the use of the different support instruments and the approach of structural adjustment as defined in Articles 243 and 244; (c) ensure that the eligibility of ACP economic operators for access to the resources of the programme is as wide and transparent as possible and that the best price/quality ratio is obtained on imported goods. To this end this Convention's tendering procedures must be applied flexibly in order to: - ensure the rapidity of disbursements, - minimize the administrative burden on the State | concerned, - accord with the administrative and commercial practices of that State; (d) be the subject of an agreement between the Commission and the ACP body in charge of the implementation of the programme. ARTICLE 249. In order to increase the flow of financial resources the Community, with the agreement of the ACP State concerned, may enter into cofinancing arrangements with other donors or agencies. The various provisions of this Convention on cofinancing shall apply. To this end and in order to ensure effective use of resources and to minimize delays, efforts shall be made, subject to the agreement of the ACP State concerned and with its effective participation, to: (a) coordinate the approach of the various donors towards structural adjustment support; (b) coordinate operational implementation in a simple and cost-effective manner. ARTICLE 250. 1. The ACP State's request for structural adjustment support shall contain the broad outline of the underlying problems being addressed by the ACP State and of the measures and actions being implemented or contemplated, the areas in which support is required, the social repercussions being experienced or envisaged and proposals to deal with them, as well as the cost estimates of the support programme for which assistance is being sought and the duration or likely period of completion. 2. The preparation, appraisal and financing decision for structural adjustment programmes shall be carried out according to the provisions on implementation procedures of Chapter 5 with due regard to the need to ensure the quick disbursing feature of structural adjustment programmes. On a case-by-case basis, retro-active financing of a limited part of imports of ACP-EEC origin may be permissible. 3. In the case of foreign exchange programmes, funds will be transferred to an ecu-denominated bank account opened by the ACP States concerned in a Community Member State from which all disbursement covered by the programme shall be made. Such funds will be considered as an advance to be cleared by the submission of justification of the use of funds. Section 4. Cofinancing ARTICLE 251. 1. The financial resources provided for in this Convention may be applied, at the request of the ACP States, to cofinancing (undertaken in particular with development agencies and institutions, Community Member States, ACP States, third countries or international or private financial institutions, firms, or export credit agencies). 2. Special consideration shall be given to the possibility of cofinancing in the following cases, among others: (a) large-scale projects which cannot be financed ex- clusively by any one source of financing alone; (b) projects in which Community participation, and an input of its project expertise, might facilitate the participation of other additional sources of finance; (c) projects which may benefit from a blend of concessionary and non-concessionary financing; (d) projects which may be broken down into sub-projects which could be eligible for financing from different sources; (e) projects for which a diversification of financing may Jead to an advantageous solution from the point of view of the financing and investment costs and of other aspects of the implementation of the said projects; (f) projects of a regional or inter-regional nature. 3. Cofinancing may be in the form of joint or parallel financing. Preference will be given in each case to the solution which is more suitable from the point of view of cost-effectiveness. 4. With the agreement of the parties concerned: (a) measures shall be taken to coordinate and harmonize operations of the Community and those of other cofinancing bodies, in order to minimize the number of procedures to be undertaken by the ACP States and to render those procedures more flexible, notably as regards: (i) the needs of other cofinancing bodies and recipients; (ii) the choice of projects to be cofinanced and the arrangements for carrying them out; (iii) the harmonization of works, supply and services contracts rules and procedures; (iv) the payment terms; (v) the rules of eligibility and competition; (vi) the margin of preference granted to ACP enterprises; (b) the process of consultation and coordination with other donors and cofinanciers should be strengthened and developed, where possible, through the establishment of cofinancing framework agreements, and cofinancing policies and procedures should be reviewed to ensure effectiveness and the best terms possible; (c) the Community may provide the other cofinancing bodies with administrative help or may act as a lead or coordinating agency for projects part-financed by it in order to facilitate the implementation of cofinanced projects or programmes. Section 5. Micro-projects ARTICLE 252. 1.
