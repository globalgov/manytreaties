Each Party shall provide that, except with respect to importers that have been notified under paragraph 8, no special duty or penalty shall be imposed for failure to comply with country of origin marking requirements of that Party, unless the good is removed from customs custody or control without being properly marked, or a deceptive marking has been used. 10.

No later than January 1, 2004, Mexico shall bring any inconsistent provision of the Auto Decree and the Auto Decree Implementing Regulations into conformity with the other provisions of this Agreement. Autoparts Industry, National Suppliers and Independent Maquiladoras 2. Mexico may not require that an enterprise attain a level of national value added in excess of 20 percent of its total sales as one of the conditions to qualify as a national supplier or enterprise of the autoparts industry. 3. Mexico may require that a national supplier or an enterprise of the autoparts industry, in calculating its national value added solely for purposes of paragraph 2, include customs duties in the value of imports incorporated into the autoparts produced by such supplier or enterprise. 4. Mexico shall grant national supplier status to an independent maquiladora that requests such status and meets the requirements for that status set out in the existing Auto Decree, as modified by paragraphs 2 and 3. Mexico shall continue to grant to all independent maquiladoras that request national supplier status all existing rights and privileges accorded to independent maquiladoras under the existing Decree for the Promotion and Operation of the Maquiladora Export Industry ("Decreto para el Fomento y Operación de la Industria Maquiladora de Exportación"), December 22, 1989 (the "Maquiladora Decree"). National Value Added 5. Mexico shall provide that a manufacturer ("empresa de la industria terminal") calculate its required national value added from suppliers (VANp) as a percentage of: (a) the manufacturer's reference value as set out in paragraph 8; or (b) the manufacturer's total national value added (VANt), whichever is greater, except that Mexico shall provide that a manufacturer beginning production of motor vehicles in Mexico after model year 1991 calculate its required national value added from suppliers (VANp) as a percentage of its total national value added (VANt). 6.

Notwithstanding paragraph 6, Mexico shall allow a manufacturer that produced motor vehicles in Mexico before model year 1992 to use as its percentage referred to in paragraph 5 the ratio of actual national value added from suppliers (VANp) to total national value added (VANt) that the manufacturer attained in model year 1992, for so long as that ratio is lower than the applicable percentage specified under paragraph 6. In determining such ratio for model year 1992, purchases that the manufacturer made from independent maquiladoras that would have been eligible to receive national supplier status had paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Appendix been in effect at that time, shall be included in the calculation of the manufacturer's national value added from suppliers (VANp), in the same manner as autoparts from any other national supplier or enterprise of the autoparts industry. 8. The annual reference value for a manufacturer ("reference value") shall be: (a) for each of the years 1994 through 1997, the base value for the manufacturer, plus no more than 65 percent of the difference between the manufacturer's total sales in Mexico in that year and its base value; (b) for each of the years 1998 through 2000, the base value for the manufacturer, plus no more than 60 percent of the difference between the manufacturer's total sales in Mexico in that year and its base value; and (c) for each of the years 2001 through 2003, the base value for the manufacturer, plus no more than 50 percent of the difference between the manufacturer's total sales in Mexico in that year and its base value. 9. 10. Mexico shall provide that where a manufacturer's total sales in Mexico in a year are lower than its base value, the reference value for the manufacturer for that year shall be equal to the manufacturer's total sales in Mexico for the year. 10. In the event an abnormal production disruption affects a manufacturer's production capability, Mexico shall allow the manufacturer to seek a reduction in its reference value before the Intersecretariat Automotive Industry Commission, established under Chapter V of the Auto Decree. If the Commission finds that the production capability of the manufacturer has been impaired by such an abnormal production disruption, the Commission shall reduce the manufacturer's reference value in an amount commensurate to the event. may not require that the percentage referred to in paragraph 5 be greater than: 11. If, on the request of a manufacturer, the Intersecretariat Automotive Industry Commission finds that the production capability of the manufacturer has been significantly disrupted as a result of a major retooling or plant conversion in the facilities of the manufacturer, the Commission shall reduce the manufacturer's reference value for that year in an amount commensurate with the disruption, provided that any reduction in that manufacturer's required national value added from suppliers (VANp) that may result from the Commission's determination to reduce the manufacturer's reference value shall be fully made up by the manufacturer over the 24 months after the date on which the retooling or plant conversion is completed. Trade Balance 12. Mexico may not require a manufacturer to include in the calculation of its trade balance (S) a percentage of the value of direct and indirect imports of autoparts that the manufacturer incorporated into that manufacturer's production in Mexico for sale in Mexico (VTVd) in the corresponding year, greater than the following: (a) 80 percent for 1994; (b) 77.2 percent for 1995; (c) 74.4 percent for 1996; (d) 71.6 percent for 1997; (e) 68.9 percent for 1998; (f) 66.1 percent for 1999; (g) 63.3 percent for 2000; (h) 60.5 percent for 2001; (i) 57.7 percent for 2002; and (j) 55.0 percent for 2003. 13. Mexico shall provide that, for purposes of determining a manufacturer's total national value added (VANt), paragraph 12 shall not apply to the calculation of the manufacturer's trade balance (S). 14. Mexico shall allow a manufacturer with a surplus in its extended trade balance to divide its extended trade balance by the applicable percentages in paragraph 12 to determine the total value of new motor vehicles that it may import. 15. Mexico shall provide that a manufacturer's adjustment factor (Y), included in the calculation of such manufacturer's extended trade balance, shall be equal to: (a) for a manufacturer that produced motor vehicles prior to model year 1992 (i) the greater of the manufacturer's reference value or the manufacturer's total national value added (VANt), minus (ii) the manufacturer's actual national value added from suppliers (VANp) divided by the appropriate percentage specified under paragraph 6 or 7 as appropriate; (b) for all other manufacturers (i) the manufacturer's total national value added (VANt), minus (ii) the manufacturer's actual national value added from suppliers (VANp) divided by the appropriate percentage specified under paragraph 6, except that the adjustment factor (Y) shall be zero if the amount resulting from subtracting (ii) from (i), under (a) or (b), is negative. 16. In determining the annual amount that a manufacturer may apply to its extended trade balance from unused surpluses earned prior to model year 1991, Mexico shall in any year allow the manufacturer to elect: (a) to use the procedures of the existing Auto Decree Implementing Regulations; or (b) to apply up to the Mexican peso equivalent of US$150 million, adjusted annually for cumulative inflation, from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, based on the implicit price deflator for U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or any successor index published by the Council of Economic Advisers in its "Economic Indicators" (hereinafter "U.S. GDP price deflator"). To adjust the US$150 million ceiling for cumulative inflation up to a certain month of a year following 1994, the $150 million shall be multiplied by the ratio of (i) the U.S. GDP price deflator current as of the month of that year, to (ii) the U.S. GDP price deflator current as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, provided that the price deflators under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) have the same base year. The resulting adjusted amount shall be rounded to the nearest million dollars. 17. Mexico shall eliminate any restriction that limits the number of motor vehicles that a manufacturer may import into Mexico in relation to the total number of motor vehicles that such manufacturer sells in Mexico. 18. For greater certainty, the differences in treatment required under paragraphs 5, 7 and 15 shall not be considered to be inconsistent with Article 1103 (Investment - Most - Favored - Nation Treatment). Other Restrictions 19. For the first 10 years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Mexico may maintain prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of new automotive products provided for in existing items 8407.34.02 (gasoline engines larger than 1000 cm3 but smaller than or equal to 2000cm3. except for motorcycles), and 8407.34.99 (gasoline engines larger than 2000cm3, except for motorcycles) and 8703.10.99 (other special vehicles) in the Tariff Schedule of the General Import Duty Act ("Tarifa de la Ley del Impuesto General de Importación"), except that Mexico may not prohibit or restrict the importation of automotive products provided for in item 8407.34.02 (gasoline engines larger than 1000 cm3 but smaller than or equal to 2000cm3. except for motorcycles), 8407.34.99 (gasoline engines larger than 2000 cm3, except for motorcycles), or 8703.10.99 (other special vehicles) by manufacturers that comply with the Auto Decree and the Auto Decree Implementing Regulations, as modified by this Appendix.

Annex 300-B Textile and Apparel Goods Section 1: Scope and Coverage 1. This Annex applies to the textile and apparel goods set out in Appendix 1.1. 2. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles (Multifiber Arrangement), as amended and extended, including any amendment or extension after January 1, 1994, or any other existing or future agreement applicable to trade in textile or apparel goods, this Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency, unless the Parties agree otherwise. Section 2: Tariff Elimination 1. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall progressively eliminate its customs duties on originating textile and apparel goods in accordance with its Schedule to Annex 302.2 (Tariff Elimination), and as set out for ease of reference in Appendix 2.1. 2. For purposes of this Annex: (a) a textile or apparel good shall be considered an originating good if the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Chapter Four (Rules of Origin) has been satisfied in the territory of one or more of the Parties in accordance with Article 404 (Accumulation); and (b) for purposes of determining which rate of customs duty and staging category is applicable to an originating textile or apparel good, a good shall be considered a good of a Party (i) as determined by each importing Party's regulations, practices or procedures, except that (ii) in the event of an agreement between the Parties pursuant to Annex 311 as determined by such agreement. 3. 4. An importing Party and an exporting Party may identify at any time particular textile and apparel goods that they mutually agree fall within: (a) hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry; (b) hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-loomed fabrics; or (c) traditional folklore handicraft goods. The importing Party shall grant duty-free treatment to goods so identified, if certified by the competent authority of the exporting Party. 4. Appendix 2.4 applies to the Parties specified in that Appendix respecting the elimination of tariffs on certain textile and apparel goods. Section 3: Import and Export Prohibitions, Restrictions and Consultation Levels 1. Each Party may maintain a prohibition, restriction or consultation level only in accordance with Appendix 3.1 or as otherwise provided in this Annex. 2. Each Party shall eliminate any prohibition, restriction or consultation level on a textile or apparel good that otherwise would be permitted under this Annex if that Party is required to eliminate such measure as a result of having integrated that good into the GATT as a result of commitments undertaken by that Party under any successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement. Section 4: Bilateral Emergency Actions (Tariff Actions) 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 through 5 and during the transition period only, if, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this Agreement, a textile or apparel good originating in the territory of a Party, or a good that has been integrated into the GATT pursuant to a commitment undertaken by a Party under any successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement and entered under a tariff preference level set out in Appendix 6, is being imported into the territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the damage or actual threat thereof: (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty provided for under this Agreement on the good; or (b) increase the rate of duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of (i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty in effect at the time the action is taken, and (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on December 31, 1993. 2. In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the Party: (a) shall examine the effect of increased imports on the particular industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and investment, none of which is necessarily decisive; and (b) shall not consider changes in technology or consumer preference as factors supporting a determination of serious damage or actual threat thereof. 3. 4. A Party shall deliver without delay to any Party that may be affected by an emergency action taken under this Section written notice of its intent to take such action, and on request shall enter into consultations with that Party. 4. The following conditions and limitations apply to any emergency action taken under this Section: (a) no action may be maintained for a period exceeding three years or, except with the consent of the Party against whose good the action is taken, have effect beyond the expiration of the transition period; (b) no action may be taken by a Party against any particular good originating in the territory of another Party more than once during the transition period; and (c) on termination of the action, the rate of duty shall be the rate that, according to the Schedule for the staged elimination of the tariff, would have been in effect one year after the initiation of the action, and beginning January 1 of the year following the termination of the action, at the option of the Party that has taken the action (i) the rate of duty shall conform to the applicable rate set out in that Party's Schedule to Annex 302.2, or (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual stages ending on the date set out in that Party's Schedule to Annex 302.2 for the elimination of the tariff. 5. The Party taking an action under this Section shall provide to the Party against whose good the action is taken mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the action. Such concessions shall be limited to the textile and apparel goods set out in Appendix 1.1, unless the Parties otherwise agree. If the Parties concerned are unable to agree on compensation, the exporting Party may take tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken under this Section against any goods imported from the Party that initiated the action under this Section. The Party taking the tariff action shall only apply the action for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects. 6. For purposes of this Section, a good originating in the territory of a Party shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.2. 7. Paragraphs 1 through 5 shall also apply to textile and apparel goods described in Appendix 2.4. Section 5: Bilateral Emergency Actions (Quantitative Restrictions) 1. Subject to Appendix 5.1, a Party may take bilateral emergency action against non- originating textile or apparel goods of another Party in accordance with this Section and Appendix 3.1. 2. If a Party considers that a non-originating textile or apparel good, including a good entered under a tariff preference level set out in Appendix 6, is being imported into its territory from a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good, under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good in the importing Party, the importing Party may request consultations with the other Party with a view to eliminating the serious damage or actual threat thereof. 3. The Party requesting consultations shall include in its request for consultations the reasons that it considers demonstrate that such serious damage or actual threat thereof to its domestic industry is resulting from the imports of the other Party, including the latest data concerning such damage or threat. 4. In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the Party shall apply Section 4(2). 5. The Parties concerned shall begin consultations within 60 days of the request for consultations and shall endeavor to agree on a mutually satisfactory level of restraint on exports of the particular good within 90 days of the request, unless the consulting Parties agree to extend this period. In reaching a mutually satisfactory level of export restraint, the consulting Parties shall: (a) consider the situation in the market in the importing Party; (b) consider the history of trade in textile and apparel goods between the consulting Parties, including previous levels of trade; and (c) seek to ensure that the textile and apparel goods imported from the territory of the exporting Party are accorded equitable treatment as compared with treatment accorded like textile and apparel goods from non-Party suppliers. 6. If the consulting Parties do not agree on a mutually satisfactory level of export restraint, the Party requesting consultations may impose annual quantitative restrictions on imports of the good from the territory of the other Party, subject to paragraphs 7 through 13. 7. Any quantitative restriction imposed under paragraph 6 shall be no less than the sum of: (a) the quantity of the good imported into the territory of the Party requesting consultations from the Party that would be affected by the restriction, as reported in general import statistics of the importing Party, during the first 12 of the most recent 14 months preceding the month in which the request for consultations was made; and (b) 20 percent of such quantity for cotton, man-made fiber and other non-cotton vegetable fiber good categories, and six percent for wool good categories. 8. The first period of any quantitative restriction imposed under paragraph 6 shall begin on the day after the date on which the request for consultations was made and terminate at the end of the calendar year in which the quantitative restriction is imposed. Any quantitative restriction that is imposed for a first period of less than 12 months shall be prorated to correspond to the time remaining in the calendar year in which the restriction is imposed, and the prorated amount may be adjusted in accordance with the flexibility provisions set out in paragraphs 8(b) and (c) of Appendix 3.1. 9. For each successive calendar year that the quantitative restriction imposed under paragraph 6 remains in effect, the Party imposing it shall: (a) increase it by six percent for cotton, man-made fiber and noncotton vegetable fiber textile and apparel goods, and by two percent for wool textile and apparel goods, and (b) accelerate the growth rate for quantitative restrictions on cotton, man-made fiber and non-cotton vegetable fiber textile and apparel goods if required by any successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement, and the flexibility provisions set out in paragraphs 8(b) and (c) of Appendix 3.1 apply. 10. A quantitative restriction imposed under paragraph 6 before July 1 in any calendar year may remain in effect for the remainder of that year, plus two additional calendar years. Such a restriction imposed on or after July 1 in any calendar year may remain in effect for the remainder of that year, plus three additional calendar years. No such restriction may remain in effect beyond the transition period. 11. No Party may take an emergency action under this Section with respect to any particular textile or apparel non-originating good against which a quantitative restriction is in effect. 12. No Party may adopt or maintain a quantitative restriction under this Section on a particular textile or apparel good that otherwise would be permitted under this Annex, if that Party is required to eliminate such measure as a result of having integrated that good into the GATT as a result of commitments undertaken by that Party pursuant to any successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement. 13. No Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the expiration of the transition period with respect to cases of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to domestic industry arising from the operation of this Agreement except with the consent of the Party against whose good the action would be taken. Section 6: Special Provisions Appendix 6 sets out special provisions applicable to certain textile and apparel goods. Section 7: Review and Revision of Rules of Origin 1. (a) The Parties shall monitor the effects of the application of the rule of origin set out in Annex 401 applicable to goods of subheading 6212.10 of the Harmonized System (HS). No earlier than April 1, 1995, a Party may request consultations with the other Parties to seek a mutually satisfactory solution to any difficulties that it considers result from the application of that rule of origin. (b) If the consulting Parties fail to reach a mutually satisfactory solution within 90 days of a request for consultations, on request of any Party the rule of origin applicable to subheading 6212.10 shall change to the rule of origin set out in Annex 401 applicable to headings 62.06 through 62.11 with respect to trade between the requesting Party and the other Parties. Any such change shall be effective 180 days after the request. The Parties shall take measures to ease any resulting administrative burden on producers. (c) Unless the Parties agree otherwise, at any time after the completion of consultations held under subparagraph (a) and during the transition period only, a Party that has requested such consultations may make one additional request for consultations under subparagraph (a) and take action under subparagraph (b). 2. (a) On request of any Party, the Parties shall consult to consider whether particular goods should be subject to different rules of origin to address issues of availability of supply of fibers, yarns or fabrics in the free trade area. (b) In the consultations, each Party shall consider all data presented by a Party showing substantial production in its territory of the particular good. The consulting Parties shall consider that substantial production has been shown if that Party demonstrates that its domestic producers are capable of supplying commercial quantities of the good in a timely manner. (c) The Parties shall endeavor to conclude consultations within 60 days of the request. An agreement between two or more Parties resulting from the consultations shall supersede any prior rule of origin for such good when approved by each such Party in accordance with Article 2202(2) (Amendments). If no agreement is reached, a Party may have recourse to paragraph B.8 of Appendix 6. (d) Further to subparagraph (a), on request of any Party, the Parties shall consult to consider whether the rules of origin set out in Annex 401 applicable to the following provisions should be amended in view of increasing availability of supply of relevant yarns or fabrics within the free trade area: (i) Canadian tariff item 5407.60.10, Mexican tariff item 5407.60.02 and U.S. tariff item 5407.60.22, (ii) provisions (a) through (i) of the rule of origin for subheadings 6205.20 through 6205.30, (iii) goods of subheadings 6107.21, 6108.21 and 6108.31, wholly of fabric of Canadian tariff item 6002.92.10, Mexican tariff item 6002.92.01, and U.S. tariff item 6002.92.10, and exclusive of collar, cuffs, waistband, elastic or lace; (iv) note 2 to Chapter 62 of Annex 401, and (v) Canadian tariff item 6303.92.10, Mexican tariff item 6303.92.01 and U.S. tariff item 6303.92.aa. 3. The Parties shall review the rules of origin applicable to textile and apparel goods within five years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement to take into account the effect of increasing global competition on textile and apparel goods and the implications of any integration into the GATT of textile and apparel goods pursuant to any successor agreement to the Multifiber Arrangement. The Parties shall give particular consideration to operative rules in other economic association or integration agreements and developments relating to textile and apparel production and trade. Section 8: Labelling Requirements The Subcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel Goods established under Article 913(5) shall perform the functions set out in Annex 913.5.a4. Section 9: Trade in Worn Clothing and Other Worn Articles 1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade in Worn Clothing, comprising representatives of each Party. The Committee shall: (a) include or consult with a broadly representative group drawn from the manufacturing and retailing sectors in each Party; and (b) act in a transparent manner and, if no member of the Committee formally objects, make recommendations to the Commission. 2. The Committee shall assess the potential benefits and risks that may result from the elimination of existing restrictions on trade between the Parties in worn clothing and other worn articles, as defined in heading 63.09 of the HS, including the effects on business and employment opportunities, and on the market for textile and apparel goods in each Party. 3. A Party may maintain restrictions in effect on the date of entry into force of this Agreement on the importation of worn clothing and other worn articles classified under heading 63.09 of the HS, unless the Parties agree otherwise on the basis of the recommendations presented to the Commission by the Committee on Trade in Worn Clothing. Section 10: Definitions For purposes of this Annex: average yarn number, as applied to woven fabrics of cotton or man-made fibers, means the average yarn number of the yarns contained therein. In computing the average yarn number, the length of the yarn is considered to be equal to the distance covered by it in the fabric, with all clipped yarn being measured as if continuous and with the count being taken of the total single yarns in the fabric including the single yarns in any multiple (folded) or cabled yarns. The weight shall be taken after any excessive sizing is removed by boiling or other suitable process. Any one of the following formulas can be used to determine the average yarn number: BYT ,100T ,BT orST N = ----- ------ ---- ----- 1,000 Z' Z 10 when: N is the average yarn number, B is the breadth (width) of the fabric in centimeters, Y is the meters (linear) of the fabric per kilogram, T is the total single yarns per square centimeter, S is the square meters of fabric per kilogram, Z is the grams per linear meter of fabric, and Z' is the grams per square meter of fabric.

Appendix 3.1: Administration of Import and Export Prohibitions, Restrictions and Consultation Levels A. Trade between Canada and Mexico and between Mexico and the United States 1. This Appendix applies to prohibitions, restrictions and consultation levels on nonoriginating textile and apparel goods. 2. An exporting Party whose textile or apparel good is subject to a prohibition, restriction or consultation level shall limit its annual exports to the specified limits or levels, and the importing Party may assist the exporting Party in implementing the prohibition, restriction or consultation level by controlling its imports. 3. Each Party shall count exports of textile and apparel goods subject to a restriction or consultation level against the limit or level: (a) applicable to the calendar year in which the good was exported; or (b) authorized for the following year if such exports exceed the authorized limit or level for the calendar year in which the good was exported, if allowed entry into the territory of the importing Party. 4. Each exporting Party whose goods are subject to a restriction or consultation level shall endeavor to space exports of such goods to the territory of the importing Party evenly throughout each calendar year, taking into consideration normal seasonal factors. 5. On written request of an exporting Party whose goods are subject to a prohibition, restriction or consultation level, that Party and the importing Party shall consult within 30 days of receipt of the request on any matter arising from the implementation of this Appendix. 6. On written request of an exporting Party that considers the application of a prohibition, restriction or consultation level under this Annex has placed it in an inequitable position in relation to another Party or a nonParty, the exporting Party and importing Party shall consult within 60 days of receipt of the request to seek a mutually beneficial solution. 7. An importing Party and an exporting Party, at any time by mutual agreement, may adjust annual Designated Consultation Levels (DCLs) as follows: (a) (b) if the exporting Party whose goods are subject to a DCL wishes to export goods in any category in excess of the applicable DCL in any calendar year, that Party may present to the importing Party a formal written request for an increase in the DCL; and the importing Party shall respond, in writing, within 30 days of the receipt of the request. If the response is negative, the Parties concerned shall consult no later than 15 days after the receipt of the response or as soon thereafter as mutually convenient, and shall endeavor to reach a mutually satisfactory solution. The Parties concerned shall confirm any agreement reached on a new DCL by an exchange of letters. 8. Adjustments to annual specific limits (SLs), including those set out in Schedule 3.1.2, may be made as follows: (a) an exporting Party wishing to adjust an SL shall deliver a notice to the importing Party of its intent to make an adjustment; (b) the exporting Party may increase the SL for a calendar year by no more than six percent ("swing"); and (c) in addition to any increase of its SL under subparagraph (b), the exporting Party may increase its unadjusted SL for that year by no more than 11 percent by allocating to such SL for that calendar year (the "receiving year") an unused portion ("shortfall") of the corresponding SL for the previous calendar year ("carryover") or a portion of the corresponding SL for the following calendar year ("carryforward"), as follows: (i) subject to subparagraph (iii), the exporting Party may utilize carryover, as available, up to 11 percent of the unadjusted SL for the receiving year, (ii) the exporting Party may utilize carryforward charged against the corresponding SL for the following calendar year, up to six percent of the unadjusted SL for the receiving year, (iii) the combination of the exporting Party's carryover and carryforward shall not exceed 11 percent of the unadjusted SL in the receiving year, and (iv) carryover may be utilized only following confirmation by the importing Party that sufficient shortfall exists. If the importing Party does not consider that sufficient shortfall exists, it shall promptly provide data to the exporting Party to support that view. Where substantial statistical differences exist between the import and export data on which the shortfall is computed, the Parties concerned shall seek to resolve these differences promptly. B. Trade between Mexico and the United States 9. During the transition period, nonoriginating textile and apparel goods of Mexico exported to the United States shall be subject to the restrictions and consultation levels specified in Schedule 3.1.2, in accordance with this Appendix and its Schedules. Such restrictions and consultation levels shall be progressively eliminated as follows: (a) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained in the categories of textile and apparel goods in staging category 1 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be eliminated on January 1, 1994; (b) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained in the categories of textile and apparel goods in staging category 2 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be eliminated on January 1, 2001; and (c) restrictions or consultation levels on items contained in the categories of textile and apparel goods in staging category 3 in Schedule 3.1.1 shall be eliminated on January 1, 2004. 10. In addition, on January 1, 1994, the United States shall eliminate restrictions or consultation levels on textile and apparel goods that are assembled in Mexico from fabrics wholly formed and cut in the United States and exported from and reimported into the United States under: (a) U.S. tariff item 9802.00.80.10; or (b) Chapter 61, 62 or 63 if, after such assembly, those goods that would have qualified for treatment under 9802.00.80.10 have been subject to bleaching, garment dyeing, stonewashing, acidwashing or permapressing. Thereafter, notwithstanding Section 5, the United States shall not adopt or maintain prohibitions, restrictions or consultation levels on textile and apparel goods of Mexico that satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (a) or (b) or the requirements of any successor provision to U.S. tariff item 9802.00.80.10. 11. Mexico and the United States may identify at any time particular textile and apparel goods that they mutually agree fall within: (a) handloomed fabrics of a cottage industry; (b) handmade cottage industry goods made of such handloomed fabrics; or (c) traditional folklore handicraft goods. The importing Party shall exempt from restrictions and consultation levels goods so identified, if certified by the competent authority of the exporting Party. 12. The Bilateral Textile Agreement Between the United States of America and the United Mexican States, signed at Mazatlán, February 13, 1988, as amended and extended (the Bilateral Agreement), shall terminate on the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 13. On request of either Party, the Parties shall consult to consider accelerating the elimination of restrictions or consultation levels set out in Schedule 3.1.2 on specific textile and apparel goods. An agreement between the Parties to accelerate the elimination of a restriction or consultation level shall supersede Schedule 3.1.1 when approved by each such Party in accordance with Article 2202(2) (Amendments). 14. During 1994, Mexico may carry over any unused portion of the 1993 limit specified in the Bilateral Agreement, or apply against the 1994 limit specified in this Appendix any exports made during 1993 in excess of the applicable limit under the Bilateral Agreement, in accordance with the flexibility provisions set forth in paragraph 8. 15. All exports of textile and apparel goods from the territory of Mexico to the territory of the United States covered by restrictions or consultation levels under this Appendix shall be accompanied by an export visa issued by the competent authority of Mexico, pursuant to any bilateral visa arrangement in effect between the Parties. 16. On written request of either Party, both Parties shall consult within 30 days of receipt of the request on any matter arising from the implementation of this Appendix. In addition, on written request of either Party, both Parties shall conduct a review of this Appendix by January 1, 1999. 17. For purposes of applying prohibitions, restrictions or consultation levels, each Party shall consider a good as being of: (a) man-made fibers if the good is in chief weight of manmade fibers, unless (i) the good is knitted or crocheted apparel in which wool equals or exceeds 23 percent by weight of all fibers, in which case it shall be of wool, (ii) the good is apparel, not knitted or crocheted, in which wool equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight of all fibers, in which case it shall be of wool, or (iii) the good is a woven fabric in which wool equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight of all fibers, in which case it shall be of wool; (b) cotton, if not covered by subparagraph (a) and if the good is in chief weight of cotton, unless the good is a woven fabric in which wool equals or exceeds 36 percent by weight of all fibers, in which case it shall be of wool; (c) wool, if not covered by subparagraph (a) or (b), and the good is in chief weight of wool; and (d) non-cotton vegetable fiber, if not covered by subparagraph (a), (b) or (c), and the good is in chief weight of non-cotton vegetable fiber, unless (i) (ii) (iii) cotton with wool and/or man-made fibers in the aggregate equal or exceed 50 percent by weight of the component fibers thereof and the cotton component equals or exceeds the weight of each of the total wool and/or man-made fiber components, in which case it shall be of cotton, if not covered by subparagraph (i) and wool exceeds 17 percent by weight of all component fibers, in which case it shall be of wool, or if not covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii) and manmade fibers in combination with cotton and/or wool in the aggregate equal or exceed 50 percent by weight of the component fibers thereof and the man-made fiber component exceeds the weight of the total wool and/or total cotton component, in which case it shall be of man-made fibers. For purposes of this paragraph, only the textile fibers in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good are to be considered. C. Schedules To determine which HS provisions are contained in a U.S. category listed in the Schedules to this Appendix, the Parties shall refer to the Correlation: Textile and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 1992 (or successor document), U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Textiles and Apparel, Trade and Data Division, Washington, D.C.

CHAPTER FOUR: RULES OF ORIGIN Article 401: Originating Goods Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, a good shall originate in the territory of a Party where: a) the good is wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties, as defined in Article 415; b) each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergoes an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 401 as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties, or the good otherwise satisfies the applicable requirements of that Annex where no change in tariff classification is required, and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this Chapter; c) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties exclusively from originating materials; or d) except for a good provided for in Chapters 61 through 63 of the Harmonized System, the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties but one or more of the non-originating materials provided for as parts under the Harmonized System that are used in the production of the good does not undergo a change in tariff classification because (i) (ii) the good was imported into the territory of a Party in an unassembled or a disassembled form but was classified as an assembled good pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation 2(a) of the Harmonized System, or the heading for the good provides for and specifically describes both the good itself and its parts and is not further subdivided into subheadings, or the subheading for the good provides for and specifically describes both the good itself and its parts, provided that the regional value content of the good, determined in accordance with Article 402, is not less than 60 percent where the transaction value method is used, or is not less than 50 percent where the net cost method is used, and that the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this Chapter. Article 402: Regional Value Content 1. Except as provided in paragraph 5, each Party shall provide that the regional value content of a good shall be calculated, at the choice of the exporter or producer of the good, on the basis of either the transaction value method set out in paragraph 2 or the net cost method set out in paragraph 3. 2. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer may calculate the regional value content of a good on the basis of the following transaction value method: TV VNM RVC = --------------- x 100 TV where RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; TV is the transaction value of the good adjusted to a F.O.B. basis; and VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good. 3. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer may calculate the regional value content of a good on the basis of the following net cost method: NC VNM RVC = --------------- x 100 NC where 4. Except as provided in Article 403(1) and for a motor vehicle identified in Article 403(2) or a component identified in Annex 403.2, the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of a good shall not, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good under paragraph 2 or 3, include the value of nonoriginating materials used to produce originating materials that are subsequently used in the production of the good. 5. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer shall calculate the regional value content of a good solely on the basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 3 where: a) there is no transaction value for the good; b) the transaction value of the good is unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code; c) the good is sold by the producer to a related person and the volume, by units of quantity, of sales of identical or similar goods to related persons during the six-month period immediately preceding the month in which the good is sold exceeds 85 percent of the producer's total sales of such goods during that period; d) the good is (i) a motor vehicle provided for in heading 87.01 or 87.02, subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90, or heading 87.04, 87.05 or 87.06, (ii) identified in Annex 403.1 or 403.2 and is for use in a motor vehicle provided for in heading 87.01 or 87.02, subheading 8703.21 through 8703.90, or heading 87.04, 87.05 or 87.06, (iii) provided for in subheading 6401.10 through 6406.10, or RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; NC is the net cost of the good; and VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good. (iv) provided for in tariff item 8469.10.aa (word processing machines); e) the exporter or producer chooses to accumulate the regional value content of the good in accordance with Article 404; or f) the good is designated as an intermediate material under paragraph 10 and is subject to a regional value-content requirement. 6. If an exporter or producer of a good calculates the regional value-content of the good on the basis of the transaction value method set out in paragraph 2 and a Party subsequently notifies the exporter or producer, during the course of a verification pursuant to Chapter Five (Customs Procedures), that the transaction value of the good, or the value of any material used in the production of the good, is required to be adjusted or is unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the exporter or producer may then also calculate the regional value content of the good on the basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 3. 7. Nothing in paragraph 6 shall be construed to prevent any review or appeal available under Article 510 (Review and Appeal) of an adjustment to or a rejection of: a) the transaction value of a good; or b) the value of any material used in the production of a good. 8. For purposes of calculating the net cost of a good under paragraph 3, the producer of the good may: a) calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, subtract any sales promotion, marketing and aftersales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs that are included in the total cost of all such goods, and then reasonably allocate the resulting net cost of those goods to the good, b) calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocate the total cost to the good, and then subtract any sales promotion, marketing and aftersales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs and non allowable interest costs that are included in the portion of the total cost allocated to the good, or c) reasonably allocate each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the aggregate of these costs does not include any sales promotion, marketing and aftersales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs, provided that the allocation of all such costs is consistent with the provisions regarding the reasonable allocation of costs set out in the Uniform Regulations, established under Article 511 (Customs Procedures Uniform Regulations). 9. Except as provided in paragraph 11, the value of a material used in the production of a good shall: a) be the transaction value of the material determined in accordance with Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code; or b) in the event that there is no transaction value or the transaction value of the material is unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, be determined in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 of the Customs Valuation Code; and c) where not included under subparagraph (a) or (b), include (i) freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer, (ii) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or more of the Parties, and (iii) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or byproduct. 10. Except as provided in Article 403(1), any self-produced material, other than a componenet identified in Annex 403.2, that is used in the production of a good may be designated by the producer of the good as an intermediate material for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good under paragraph 2 or 3, provided that where the intermediate material is subject to a regional value-content requirement used in the production of that intermediate material may itself be designated by the producer as an intermediate material. 11. The value of an intermediate material shall be: a) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer of the good that can be reasonably allocated to that intermediate material; or b) the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to that intermediate material that can be reasonably allocated to that intermediate material. 12. 13. The value of an indirect material shall be based on the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the territory of the Party in which the good is produced.

The regional value-content requirement for a motor vehicle identified in Article 403(1) or 403(2) shall be: a) 50 percent for five years after the date on which the first motor vehicle prototype is produced in a plant by a motor vehicle assembler, if (i) it is a motor vehicle of a class, or marque, or, except for a motor vehicle identified in Article 403(2), size category and underbody, not previously produced by the motor vehicle assembler in the territory of any of the Parties, (ii) the plant consists of a new building in which the motor vehicle is assembled, and (iii) the plant contains substantially all new machinery that is used in the assembly of the motor vehicle; or b) 50 percent for two years after the date on which the first motor vehicle prototype is produced at a plant following a refit, if it is a different motor vehicle of a class, or marque, or, except for a motor vehicle identified in Article 403(2), size category and underbody, than was assembled by the motor vehicle assembler in the plant before the refit. Article 404: Accumulation 1. For purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good, the production of the good in the territory of one or more of the Parties by one or more producers shall, at the choice of the exporter or producer of the good for which preferential tariff treatment is claimed, be considered to have been performed in the territory of any of the Parties by that exporter or producer, provided that: a) all non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable tariff classification change set out in Annex 401, and the good satisfies any applicable regional value-content requirement, entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties; and b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this Chapter. 2. For purposes of Article 402(10), the production of a producer that chooses to accumulate its production with that of other producers under paragraph 1 shall be considered to be the production of a single producer. Article 405: De Minimis 1.

("CAMI") in the territory of Canada and imported into the territory of the United States qualify as originating goods, CAMI may average its calculation of the regional value content of a class of motor vehicles or a model line of motor vehicles produced in a fiscal year in the territory of Canada by CAMI for sale in the territory of one or more of the Parties with the calculation of the regional value content of the corresponding class of motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles produced in the territory of Canada by General Motors of Canada Limited in the fiscal year that corresponds most closely to CAMI's fiscal year, provided that: a) at the beginning of CAMI's fiscal year General Motors of Canada Limited owns 50 percent or more of the voting common stock of CAMI; and b) General Motors of Canada Limited, General Motors Corporation, General Motors de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., and any subsidiary directly or indirectly owned by any of them, or by any combination thereof, ("GM") acquires 75 percent or more by unit of quantity of the class of motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles, as the case may be, that CAMI has produced in the territory of Canada in CAMI's fiscal year for sale in the territory of one or more of the Parties. 2. If GM acquires less than 75 percent by unit of quantity of the class of motor vehicles or model line of motor vehicles, as the case may be, that CAMI has produced in the territory of Canada in CAMI's fiscal year for sale in the territory of one or more of the Parties, CAMI may average in the manner set out in paragraph 1 only those motor vehicles that are acquired by GM for distribution under the GEO marque or other GM marque. 3. In calculating the regional value content of motor vehicles produced by CAMI in the territory of Canada, CAMI may choose to average the calculation in paragraph 1 or 2 over a period of two fiscal years in the event that any motor vehicle assembly plant operated by CAMI or any motor vehicle assembly plant operated by General Motors of Canada Limited with which CAMI is averaging its regional value content is closed for more than two consecutive months: a) for the purpose of retooling for a model change, or b) as the result of any event or circumstance (other than the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties, or an interruption of operations resulting from a labor strike, lockout, labor dispute, picketing or boycott of or by employees of CAMI or GM), that CAMI or GM could not reasonably have been expected to avert by corrective action or by exercise of due care and diligence, including a shortage of materials, failure of utilities, or inability to obtain or delay in obtaining raw materials, parts, fuel or utilities. The averaging may be for CAMI's fiscal year in which a CAMI or any General Motors of Canada Limited plant with which CAMI is averaging is closed and either the previous or subsequent fiscal year. In the event that the period of closure spans two fiscal years, the averaging may be only for those two fiscal years. 4. For purposes of this Article, where as a result of an amalgamation, reorganization, division or similar transaction: a) a motor vehicle producer (the "successor producer") acquires all or substantially all of the assets used by GM, and b) the successor producer, directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by, GM, or both the successor producer and GM are controlled by the same person, the successor producer shall be deemed to be GM. CHAPTER FIVE: CUSTOMS PROCEDURES Section A - Certification of Origin Article 501: Certificate of Origin 1. The Parties shall establish by January 1, 1994 a Certificate of Origin for the purpose of certifying that a good being exported from the territory of a Party into the territory of another Party qualifies as an originating good, and may thereafter revise the Certificate by agreement. 2. Each Party may require that a Certificate of Origin for a good imported into its territory be completed in a language required under its law. 3. Each Party shall: a) require an exporter in its territory to complete and sign a Certificate of Origin for any exportation of a good for which an importer may claim preferential tariff treatment on importation of the good into the territory of another Party; and b) provide that where an exporter in its territory is not the producer of the good, the exporter may complete and sign a Certificate on the basis of (i) its knowledge of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, (ii) its reasonable reliance on the producer's written representation that the good qualifies as an originating good, or (iii) a completed and signed Certificate for the good voluntarily provided to the exporter by the producer. 4. 5. Nothing in paragraph 3 shall be construed to require a producer to provide a Certificate of Origin to an exporter. 5. Each Party shall provide that a Certificate of Origin that has been completed and signed by an exporter or a producer in the territory of another Party that is applicable to: a) a single importation of a good into the Party's territory, or b) multiple importations of identical goods into the Party's territory that occur within a specified period, not exceeding 12 months, set out therein by the exporter or producer, shall be accepted by its customs administration for four years after the date on which the Certificate was signed. Article 502: Obligations Regarding Importations 1. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each Party shall require an importer in its territory that claims preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of another Party to: a) make a written declaration, based on a valid Certificate of Origin, that the good qualifies as an originating good; b) have the Certificate in its possession at the time the declaration is made; c) provide, on the request of that Party's customs administration, a copy of the Certificate; and d) promptly make a corrected declaration and pay any duties owing where the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct. 2. Each Party shall provide that, where an importer in its territory claims preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of another Party: a) the Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good if the importer fails to comply with any requirement under this Chapter; and b) the importer shall not be subject to penalties for the making of an incorrect declaration, if it voluntarily makes a corrected declaration pursuant to paragraph 1(d). 3. Each Party shall provide that, where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the territory of that Party but no claim for preferential tariff treatment was made at that time, the importer of the good may, no later than one year after the date on which the good was imported, apply for a refund of any excess duties paid as the result of the good not having been accorded preferential tariff treatment, on presentation of: a) a written declaration that the good qualified as an originating good at the time of importation; b) a copy of the Certificate of Origin; and c) such other documentation relating to the importation of the good as that Party may require. ARTICLE 503: Exceptions Each Party shall provide that a Certificate of Origin shall not be required for: a) a commercial importation of a good whose value does not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in the Party's currency, or such higher amount as it may establish, except that it may require that the invoice accompanying the importation include a statement certifying that the good qualifies as an originating good, b) a non-commercial importation of a good whose value does not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in the Party's currency, or such higher amount as it may establish, or c) an importation of a good for which the Party into whose territory the good is imported has waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin, provided that the importation does not form part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the certification requirements of Articles 501 and 502. ARTICLE 504: Obligations Regarding Exportations 1. Each Party shall provide that: a) an exporter in its territory, or a producer in its territory that has provided a copy of a Certificate of Origin to that exporter pursuant to Article 501(3)(b)(iii), shall provide a copy of the Certificate to its customs administration on request; and b) an exporter or a producer in its territory that has completed and signed a Certificate of Origin, and that has reason to believe that the Certificate contains information that is not correct, shall promptly notify in writing all persons to whom the Certificate was given by the exporter or producer of any change that could affect the accuracy or validity of the Certificate. 2. Each Party: a) shall provide that a false certification by an exporter or a producer in its territory that a good to be exported to the territory of another Party qualifies as an originating good shall have the same legal consequences, with appropriate modifications, as would apply to an importer in its territory for a contravention of its customs laws and regulations regarding the making of a false statement or representation; and b) may apply such measures as the circumstances may warrant where an exporter or a producer in its territory fails to comply with any requirement of this Chapter. 3. 4. No Party may impose penalties on an exporter or a producer in its territory that voluntarily provides written notification pursuant to paragraph (1)(b) with respect to the making of an incorrect certification. Section B - Administration and Enforcement Article 505: Records Each Party shall provide that: a) an exporter or a producer in its territory that completes and signs a Certificate of Origin shall maintain in its territory, for five years after the date on which the Certificate was signed or for such longer period as the Party may specify, all records relating to the origin of a good for which preferential tariff treatment was claimed in the territory of another Party, including records associated with (i) the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, the good that is exported from its territory, (ii) the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, all materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the good that is exported from its territory, and (iii) the production of the good in the form in which the good is exported from its territory; and b) an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into the Party's territory shall maintain in that territory, for five years after the date of importation of the good or for such longer period as the Party may specify, such documentation, including a copy of the Certificate, as the Party may require relating to the importation of the good. ARTICLE 506: Origin Verifications 1. For purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the territory of another Party qualifies as an originating good, a Party may, through its customs administration, conduct a verification solely by means of: a) written questionnaires to an exporter or a producer in the territory of another Party; b) visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer in the territory of another Party to review the records referred to in Article 505(a) and observe the facilities used in the production of the good; or c) such other procedure as the Parties may agree. 2. through its customs administration: Prior to conducting a verification visit pursuant to paragraph (1)(b), a Party shall, a) deliver a written notification of its intention to conduct the visit to (i) the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited, (ii) the customs administration of the Party in whose territory the visit is to occur, and (iii) if requested by the Party in whose territory the visit is to occur, the embassy of that Party in the territory of the Party proposing to conduct the visit; and (b) obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited. 3. The notification referred to in paragraph 2 shall include: a) the identity of the customs administration issuing the notification; (b) the name of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited; c) the date and place of the proposed verification visit; d) the object and scope of the proposed verification visit, including specific reference to the good that is the subject of the verification; e) the names and titles of the officials performing the verification visit; and f) the legal authority for the verification visit. 4. Where an exporter or a producer has not given its written consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 days of receipt of notification pursuant to paragraph 2, the notifying Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that would have been the subject of the visit. 5. Each Party shall provide that, where its customs administration receives notification pursuant to paragraph 2, the customs administration may, within 15 days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 days from the date of such receipt, or for such longer period as the Parties may agree. 6. A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good based solely on the postponement of a verification visit pursuant to paragraph 5. 7. Each Party shall permit an exporter or a producer whose good is the subject of a verification visit by another Party to designate two observers to be present during the visit, provided that: a) the observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers; and b) the failure of the exporter or producer to designate observers shall not result in the postponement of the visit. 8. Each Party shall, through its customs administration, conduct a verification of a regional value-content requirement in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the territory of the Party from which the good was exported. 9. The Party conducting a verification shall provide the exporter or producer whose good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, including findings of fact and the legal basis for the determination. 10. Where verifications by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or a producer of false or unsupported representations that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with Chapter Four (Rules of Origin). 11. Each Party shall provide that where it determines that a certain good imported into its territory does not qualify as an originating good based on a tariff classification or a value applied by the Party to one or more materials used in the production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or value applied to the materials by the Party from whose territory the good was exported, the Party's determination shall not become effective until it notifies in writing both the importer of the good and the person that completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the good of its determination. 12. A Party shall not apply a determination made under paragraph 11 to an importation made before the effective date of the determination where: a) the customs administration of the Party from whose territory the good was exported has issued an advance ruling under Article 509 or any other ruling on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, or has given consistent treatment to the entry of the materials under the tariff classification or value at issue, on which a person is entitled to rely; and b) the advance ruling or consistent treatment was given prior to notification of the determination. 13. If a Party denies preferential tariff treatment to a good pursuant to a determination made under paragraph 11, it shall postpone the effective date of the denial for a period not exceeding 90 days where the importer of the good, or the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the good, demonstrates that it has relied in good faith to its detriment on the tariff classification or value applied to such materials by the customs administration of the Party from whose territory the good was exported. ARTICLE 507: Confidentiality 1. Each Party shall maintain, in accordance with its law, the confidentiality of confidential business information collected pursuant to this Chapter and shall protect that information from disclosure that could prejudice the competitive position of the persons providing the information. 2. The confidential business information collected pursuant to this Chapter may only be disclosed to those authorities responsible for the administration and enforcement of determinations of origin, and of customs and revenue matters. ARTICLE 508: Penalties 1. Each Party shall maintain measures imposing criminal, civil or administrative penalties for violations of its laws and regulations relating to this Chapter. 2. Nothing in Articles 502(2), 504(3) or 506(6) shall be construed to prevent a Party from applying such measures as the circumstances may warrant. Section C - Advance Rulings ARTICLE 509: Advance Rulings 1. Each Party shall, through its customs administration, provide for the expeditious issuance of written advance rulings, prior to the importation of a good into its territory, to an importer in its territory or an exporter or a producer in the territory of another Party, on the basis of the facts and circumstances presented by such importer, exporter or producer of the good, concerning: a) whether materials imported from a non-Party used in the production of a good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 401 as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties; b) whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under either the transaction value method or the net cost method set out in Chapter Four; c) for the purpose of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value- content requirement under Chapter Four, the appropriate basis or method for value to be applied by an exporter or a producer in the territory of another Party, in accordance with the principles of the Customs Valuation Code, for calculating the transaction value of the good or of the materials used in the production of the good; d) for the purpose of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value- content requirement under Chapter Four, the appropriate basis or method for reasonably allocating costs, in accordance with the allocation methods set out in the Uniform Regulations, for calculating the net cost of the good or the value of an intermediate material; e) whether a good qualifies as an originating good under Chapter Four; f) whether a good that re-enters its territory after the good has been exported from its territory to the territory of another Party for repair or alteration qualifies for dutyfree treatment in accordance with Article 307 (Goods Re- Entered after Repair or Alteration); g) whether the proposed or actual marking of a good satisfies country of origin marking requirements under Article 311 (Country of Origin Marking); h) whether an originating good qualifies as a good of a Party under Annex 300B (Textile and Apparel Goods), Annex 302.2 (Tariff Elimination) or Chapter Seven (Agriculture and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures); (i) whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven; or (j) such other matters as the Parties may agree. 2. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures for the issuance of advance rulings, including a detailed description of the information reasonably required to process an application for a ruling. 3. Each Party shall provide that its customs administration: a) may, at any time during the course of an evaluation of an application for an advance ruling, request supplemental information from the person requesting the ruling; b) shall, after it has obtained all necessary information from the person requesting an advance ruling, issue the ruling within the periods specified in the Uniform Regulations; and c) shall, where the advance ruling is unfavorable to the person requesting it, provide to that person a full explanation of the reasons for the ruling. 4. Subject to paragraph 6, each Party shall apply an advance ruling to importations into its territory of the good for which the ruling was requested, beginning on the date of its issuance or such later date as may be specified in the ruling. 5. Each Party shall provide to any person requesting an advance ruling the same treatment, including the same interpretation and application of provisions of Chapter Four regarding a determination of origin, as it provided to any other person to whom it issued an advance ruling, provided that the facts and circumstances are identical in all material respects. 6. The issuing Party may modify or revoke an advance ruling: a) if the ruling is based on an error (i) of fact, (ii) in the tariff classification of a good or a material that is the subject of the ruling, (iii) in the application of a regional value content requirement under Chapter Four, (iv) in the application of the rules for determining whether a good qualifies as a good of a Party under Annex 300B, 302.2 or Chapter Seven, (v) in the application of the rules for determining whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven, or (vi) in the application of the rules for determining whether a good that re- enters its territory after the good has been exported from its territory to the territory of another Party for repair or alteration qualifies for dutyfree treatment under Article 307; b) if the ruling is not in accordance with an interpretation agreed by the Parties regarding Chapter Three (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods) or Chapter Four; c) if there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based; d) to conform with a modification of Chapter Three, Chapter Four, this Chapter, Chapter Seven, the Marking Rules or the Uniform Regulations; or e) to conform with a judicial decision or a change in its domestic law. 7. Each Party shall provide that any modification or revocation of an advance ruling shall be effective on the date on which the modification or revocation is issued, or on such later date as may be specified therein, and shall not be applied to importations of a good that have occurred prior to that date, unless the person to whom the advance ruling was issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and conditions. 8. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, the issuing Party shall postpone the effective date of such modification or revocation for a period not exceeding 90 days where the person to whom the advance ruling was issued demostrates that it has relied in good faith to its detriment on that ruling. 9. Each Party shall provide that where its customs administration examines the regional value content of a good for which it has issued an advance ruling pursuant to subparagraph 1(c), (d) or f), it shall evaluate whether: a) the exporter or producer has complied with the terms and conditions of the advance ruling; b) the exporter's or producer's operations are consistent with the material facts and circumstances on which the advance ruling is based; and c) the supporting data and computations used in applying the basis or method for calculating value or allocating cost were correct in all material respects. 10. Each Party shall provide that where its customs administration determines that any requirement in paragraph 9 has not been satisfied, it may modify or revoke the advance ruling as the circumstances may warrant. 11. Each Party shall provide that, where the person to whom an advance ruling was issued demonstrates that it used reasonable care and acted in good faith in presenting the facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based, and where the customs administration of a Party determines that the ruling was based on incorrect information, the person to whom the ruling was issued shall not be subject to penalties. 12. Each Party shall provide that where it issues an advance ruling to a person that has misrepresented or omitted material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based or has failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ruling, the Party may apply such measures as the circumstances may warrant. Section D - Review and Appeal of Origin Determinations and Advance Rulings ARTICLE 510: Review and Appeal 1. Each Party shall grant substantially the same rights of review and appeal of marking determinations of origin, country of origin determinations and advance rulings by its customs administration as it provides to importers in its territory to any person: a) who completes and signs a Certificate of Origin for a good that has been the subject of a determination of origin; b) whose good has been the subject of a country of origin marking determination pursuant to Article 311 (Country of Origin Marking); or (c) who has received an advance ruling pursuant to Article 509(1). 2. Further to Articles 1804 (Administrative Proceedings) and 1805 (Review and Appeal), each Party shall provide that the rights of review and appeal referred to in paragraph 1 shall include access to: a) at least one level of administrative review independent of the official or office responsible for the determination under review; and b) in accordance with its domestic law, judicial or quasijudicial review of the determination or decision taken at the final level of administrative review.

The Parties recognize the importance of having viable and internationally competitive energy and petrochemical sectors to further their individual national interests. ARTICLE 602: Scope and Coverage 1. This Chapter applies to measures relating to energy and basic petrochemical goods originating in the territories of the Parties and to measures relating to investment and to the cross-border trade in services associated with such goods, as set forth in this Chapter. 2. For purposes of this Chapter, energy and basic petrochemical goods refer to those goods classified under the Harmonized System as: a) subheading 2612.10; b) headings 27.01 through 27.06; c) subheading 2707.50; d) subheading 2707.99 (only with respect to solvent naphtha, rubber extender oils and carbon black feedstocks); e) headings 27.08 and 27.09; f) heading 27.10 (except for normal paraffin mixtures in the range of C9 to C15); g) heading 27.11 (except for ethylene, propylene, butylene and butadiene in purities over 50 percent); h) headings 27.12 through 27.16; i) subheadings 2844.10 through 2844.50 (only with respect to uranium compounds classified under those subheadings); j) subheading 2845.10; and k) subheading 2901.10 (only with respect to ethane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and heptanes). 3.

The Parties agree that this language does not incorporate their respective protocols of provisional application to the GATT. 2. The Parties understand that the provisions of the GATT incorporated in paragraph 1 prohibit, in any circumstances in which any other form of quantitative restriction is prohibited, minimum or maximum export - price requirements and, except as permitted in enforcement of countervailing and antidumping orders and undertakings, minimum or maximum import-price requirements. 3. In circumstances where a Party adopts or maintains a restriction on importation from or exportation to a non-Party of an energy or basic petrochemical good, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the Party from: a) limiting or prohibiting the importation from the territory of any Party of such energy or basic petrochemical good of the nonParty; or b) requiring as a condition of export of such energy or basic petrochemical good of the Party to the territory of any other Party that the good be consumed within the territory of the other Party. 4. In the event that a Party adopts or maintains a restriction on imports of an energy or basic petrochemical good from non-Party countries, the Parties, on request of any Party, shall consult with a view to avoiding undue interference with or distortion of pricing, marketing and distribution arrangements in another Party. 5. Each Party may administer a system of import and export licensing for energy or basic petrochemical goods provided that such system is operated in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including paragraph 1 and Article 1502 (Monopolies and State Enterprises). 6. This Article is subject to the reservations set out in Annex 603.6. ARTICLE 604: Export Taxes No Party may adopt or maintain any duty, tax or other charge on the export of any energy or basic petrochemical good to the territory of another Party, unless such duty, tax or charge is adopted or maintained on: a) exports of any such good to the territory of all other Parties; and b) any such good when destined for domestic consumption. Article 605: Other Export Measures Subject to Annex 605, a Party may adopt or maintain a restriction otherwise justified under Articles XI:2(a) or XX(g), (i) or (j) of the GATT with respect to the export of an energy or basic petrochemical good to the territory of another Party, only if: a) the restriction does not reduce the proportion of the total export shipments of the specific energy or basic petrochemical good made available to that other Party relative to the total supply of that good of the Party maintaining the restriction as compared to the proportion prevailing in the most recent 36month period for which data are available prior to the imposition of the measure, or in such other representative period on which the Parties may agree; b) the Party does not impose a higher price for exports of an energy or basic petrochemical good to that other Party than the price charged for such good when consumed domestically, by means of any measure such as licenses, fees, taxation and minimum price requirements. The foregoing provision does not apply to a higher price that may result from a measure taken pursuant to subparagraph (a) that only restricts the volume of exports; and c) the restriction does not require the disruption of normal channels of supply to that other Party or normal proportions among specific energy or basic petrochemical goods supplied to that other Party, such as, for example, between crude oil and refined products and among different categories of crude oil and of refined products. ARTICLE 606: Energy Regulatory Measures 1. The Parties recognize that energy regulatory measures are subject to the disciplines of: a) national treatment, as provided in Article 301; b) import and export restrictions, as provided in Article 603; and c) export taxes, as provided in Article 604. 2. Each Party shall seek to ensure that in the application of any energy regulatory measure, energy regulatory bodies within its territory avoid disruption of contractual relationships to the maximum extent practicable, and provide for orderly and equitable implementation appropriate to such measures. ARTICLE 607: National Security Measures Subject to Annex 607, no Party may adopt or maintain a measure restricting imports of an energy or basic petrochemical good from, or exports of an energy or basic petrochemical good to, another Party under Article XXI of the GATT or under Article 2102 (National Security), except to the extent necessary to: a) supply a military establishment of a Party or enable fulfillment of a critical defense contract of a Party; b) respond to a situation of armed conflict involving the Party taking the measure; c) implement national policies or international agreements relating to the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or d) respond to direct threats of disruption in the supply of nuclear materials for defense purposes. ARTICLE 608: Miscellaneous Provisions 1. The Parties agree to allow existing or future incentives for oil and gas exploration, development and related activities in order to maintain the reserve base for these energy resources. 2.

CHAPTER SEVEN: AGRICULTURE AND SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES Section A - Agriculture ARTICLE 701: Scope and Coverage 1. This Section applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to agricultural trade. 2. In the event of any inconsistency between this Section and another provision of this Agreement, this Section shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. ARTICLE 702: International Obligations 1. Annex 702.1 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex with respect to agricultural trade under certain agreements between them. 2. Prior to adopting pursuant to an intergovernmental commodity agreement, a measure that may affect trade in an agricultural good between the Parties, the Party proposing to adopt the measure shall consult with the other Parties with a view to avoiding nullification or impairment of a concession granted by that Party in its Schedule to Annex 302.2. 3. Annex 702.3 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex with respect to measures adopted or maintained pursuant to an intergovernmental coffee agreement. ARTICLE 703: Market Access 1. The Parties shall work together to improve access to their respective markets through the reduction or elimination of import barriers to trade between them in agricultural goods. Customs Duties, Quantitative Restrictions, and Agricultural Grading and Marketing Standards 2. Annex 703.2 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex with respect to customs duties and quantitative restrictions, trade in sugar and syrup goods, and agricultural grading and marketing standards. Special Safeguard Provisions 3. Each Party may, in accordance with its Schedule to Annex 302.2, adopt or maintain a special safeguard in the form of a tariff rate quota on an agricultural good listed in its Section of Annex 703.3. Notwithstanding Article 302.2, a Party may not apply an over-quota tariff rate under a special safeguard that exceeds the lesser of: a) the most-favored-nation (MFN) rate as of July 1, 1991; and b) the prevailing MFN rate. 4. No Party may, with respect to the same good and the same country, at the same time: a) apply an over-quota tariff rate under paragraph 3; and b) take an emergency action covered by Chapter Eight (Emergency Action). ARTICLE 704: Domestic Support The Parties recognize that domestic support measures can be of crucial importance to their agricultural sectors but may also have trade distorting and production effects and that domestic support reduction commitments may result from agricultural multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Accordingly, where a Party supports its agricultural producers, that Party should endeavor to work toward domestic support measures that: a) have minimal or no trade distorting or production effects; or b) are exempt from any applicable domestic support reduction commitments that may be negotiated under the GATT. The Parties further recognize that a Party may change its domestic support measures, including those that may be subject to reduction commitments, at the Party's discretion, subject to its rights and obligations under the GATT. ARTICLE 705: Export Subsidies 1. The Parties share the objective of the multilateral elimination of export subsidies for agricultural goods and shall cooperate in an effort to achieve an agreement under the GATT to eliminate those subsidies. 2. The Parties recognize that export subsidies for agricultural goods may prejudice the interests of importing and exporting Parties and, in particular, may disrupt the markets of importing Parties. Accordingly, in addition to the rights and obligations of the Parties specified in Annex 702.1, the Parties affirm that it is inappropriate for a Party to provide an export subsidy for an agricultural good exported to the territory of another Party where there are no other subsidized imports of that good into the territory of that other Party. 3. Except as provided in Annex 702.1, where an exporting Party considers that a non- Party is exporting an agricultural good to the territory of another Party with the benefit of export subsidies, the importing Party shall, on written request of the exporting Party, consult with the exporting Party with a view to agreeing on specific measures that the importing Party may adopt to counter the effect of any such subsidized imports. If the importing Party adopts the agreed-upon measures, the exporting Party shall refrain from applying, or immediately cease to apply, any export subsidy to exports of such good to the territory of the importing Party. 4. Except as provided in Annex 702.1, an exporting Party shall deliver written notice to the importing Party at least three days, excluding weekends, prior to adopting an export subsidy measure on an agricultural good exported to the territory of another Party. The exporting Party shall consult with the importing Party within 72 hours of receipt of the importing Party's written request, with a view to eliminating the subsidy or minimizing any adverse impact on the market of the importing Party for that good. The importing Party shall, when requesting consultations with the exporting Party, at the same time, deliver written notice to a third Party of the request. A third Party may request to participate in such consultations. 5. Each Party shall take into account the interests of the other Parties in the use of any export subsidy on an agricultural good, recognizing that such subsidies may have prejudicial effects on the interests of the other Parties. 6. The Parties hereby establish a Working Group on Agricultural Subsidies, comprising representatives of each Party, which shall meet at least semi-annually or as the Parties may otherwise agree, to work toward elimination of all export subsidies affecting agricultural trade between the Parties. The functions of the Working Group shall include: a) monitoring the volume and price of imports into the territory of any Party of agricultural goods that have benefitted from export subsidies; b) providing a forum for the Parties to develop mutually acceptable criteria and procedures for reaching agreement on the limitation or elimination of export subsidies for imports of agricultural goods into the territories of the Parties; and c) reporting annually to the Committee on Agricultural Trade, established under Article 706, on the implementation of this Article. 7. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article: a) if the importing and exporting Parties agree to an export subsidy for an agricultural good exported to the territory of the importing Party, the exporting Party or Parties may adopt or maintain such subsidy; and b) each Party retains its rights to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports of agricultural goods from the territory of a Party or non-Party. ARTICLE 706: Committee on Agricultural Trade 1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Agricultural Trade, comprising representatives of each Party. 2. The Committee's functions shall include: a) monitoring and promoting cooperation on the implementation and administration of this Section; b) providing a forum for the Parties to consult on issues related to this Section at least semi-annually and as the Parties may otherwise agree; and c) reporting annually to the Commission on the implementation of this Section. ARTICLE 707: Advisory Committee on Private Commercial Disputes regarding Agricultural Goods The Committee shall establish an Advisory Committee on Private Commercial Disputes regarding Agricultural Goods, comprising persons with expertise or experience in the resolution of private commercial disputes in agricultural trade. The Advisory Committee shall report and provide recommendations to the Committee for the development of systems in the territory of each Party to achieve the prompt and effective resolution of such disputes, taking into account any special circumstance, including the perishability of certain agricultural goods. Article 708: Definitions For purposes of this Section: agricultural good means a good provided for in any of the following: Note: (For purposes of reference only, descriptions are provided next to the corresponding tariff provision.)

Annex 702.1: Incorporation of Trade Provisions 1. Articles 701, 702, 704, 705, 706, 707, 710 and 711 of the Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement apply, as between Canada and the United States, which Articles are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. 2. The definitions of the terms specified in Article 711 of the Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement shall apply to the Articles incorporated by paragraph 1. 03 fish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates 05.07 tortoise-shell, whalebone and whalebone hair and those fish or crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, marine mammals, and their products within this heading 05.08 coral and similar materials 05.09 natural sponges of animal origin 05.11 products of fish or crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates; dead animals of Chapter 3 15.04 fats and oils and their fractions, of fish or marine mammals 16.03 "non-meat" extracts and juices 16.04 prepared or preserved fish 16.05 prepared preserved crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates; 2301.20 flours, meals, pellets of fish 3.

The Parties understand that Article 710 of the Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement incorporates the GATT rights and obligations of Canada and the United States with respect to agricultural, food, beverage and certain related goods, including exemptions by virtue of paragraph (1)(b) of the Protocol of Provisional Application of the GATT and waivers granted under Article XXV of the GATT. Annex 702.3: Intergovernmental Coffee Agreement Notwithstanding Article 2101 (General Exceptions), neither Canada nor Mexico may adopt or maintain a measure, pursuant to an intergovernmental coffee agreement, that restricts trade in coffee between them. Annex 703.2: Market Access Section A - Mexico and the United States 1. This Section applies only as between Mexico and the United States. Customs Duties and Quantitative Restrictions 2. With respect to agricultural goods, Article 309(1) and (2) (Import and Export Restrictions) applies only to qualifying goods. 3. Each Party waives its rights under Article XI:2(c) of the GATT, and those rights as incorporated by Article 309, regarding any measure adopted or maintained with respect to the importation of qualifying goods. 4. Except with respect to a good set out in Section B or C of Annex 703.3 or Appendix 703.2.A.4, where a Party applies an over-quota tariff rate to a qualifying good pursuant to a tariff rate quota set out in its Schedule to Annex 302.2, or increases a customs duty for a sugar or syrup good to a rate, in accordance with paragraph 18, that exceeds the rate of customs duty for that good set out in its GATT Schedule of Tariff Concessions as of July 1, 1991, the other Party waives its rights under the GATT with respect to the application of that rate of customs duty. 5. Notwithstanding Article 302(2) (Tariff Elimination), where an agreement resulting from agricultural multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT enters into force with respect to a Party pursuant to which it has agreed to convert a prohibition or restriction on its importation of an agricultural good into a tariff rate quota or a customs duty, that Party may not apply to such good that is a qualifying good an over-quota tariff rate that is higher than the lower of the over-quota tariff rate set out in: a) its Schedule to Annex 302.2, and b) that agreement, and paragraph 4 shall no longer apply to the other Party with respect to that good. 6. Each Party may count the in-quota quantity under a tariff rate quota applied to a qualifying good in accordance with its Schedule to Annex 302.2 toward the satisfaction of commitments regarding an in-quota quantity of a tariff rate quota or level of access under a restriction on the importation of that good: a) that have been agreed under the GATT, including as set out in its GATT Schedule of Tariff Concessions; or b) undertaken by the Party as a result of any agreement resulting from agricultural multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT. 7. Neither Party may count toward the satisfaction of a commitment regarding an in- quota quantity of a tariff rate quota in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 an agricultural good admitted or entered into a maquiladora or foreign-trade zone and re-exported, including subsequent to processing. 8. The United States shall not adopt or maintain, with respect to the importation of an agricultural qualifying good, any fee applied pursuant to section 22 of the U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Act. 9. Neither Party may seek a voluntary restraint agreement from the other Party with respect to the exportation of meat that is a qualifying good. 10. Notwithstanding Chapter Four (Rules of Origin), for purposes of applying a rate of customs duty to a good, the United States may consider as if it were non-originating a good provided for in: a) heading 12.02 that is exported from the territory of Mexico, if the good is not wholly obtained in the territory of Mexico; b) subheading 2008.11 that is exported from the territory of Mexico, if any material provided for in heading 12.02 used in the production of that good is not wholly obtained in the territory of Mexico; or c) U.S. tariff item 1806.10.42 or 2106.90.12 that is exported from the territory of Mexico, if any material provided for in HS heading 1701.99 used in the production of that good is not a qualifying good. 11. Notwithstanding Chapter Four, for purposes of applying a rate of customs duty to a good, Mexico may consider as if it were non-originating a good provided for in: a) HS heading 12.02 that is exported from the territory of the United States, if that good is not wholly obtained in the territory of the United States; b) HS subheading 2008.11 that is exported from the territory of the United States, if any material provided for in heading 12.02 used in the production of that good is not wholly obtained in the territory of the United States; or c) Mexican tariff item 1806.10.01 (except those with a sugar content less than 90 percent) or 2106.90.05 (except those that contain added flavoring matter) that is exported from the territory of the United States, if any material provided for in HS subheading 1701.99 used in the production of that good is not a qualifying good. Restriction on Same-Condition Substitution Duty Drawback 12. Beginning on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, neither Mexico nor the United States may refund the amount of customs duties paid, or waive or reduce the amount of customs duties owed, on any agricultural good imported into its territory that is substituted for an identical or similar good that is subsequently exported to the territory of the other Party. Trade in Sugar and Syrup Goods 13. The Parties shall consult by July 1 of each of the first 14 years beginning with 1994 to determine jointly, in accordance with Appendix 703.2.A.13, whether, and if so, by what quantity either Party: a) is projected to be a net surplus producer of sugar in the next marketing year; and b) has been a net surplus producer in any marketing year beginning after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, including the current marketing year. 14. For each of the first 14 marketing years beginning after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, each Party shall accord duty-free treatment to a quantity of sugar and syrup goods that are qualifying goods not less than the greatest of: a) 7,258 metric tons raw value; b) the quota allocated by the United States for a non-Party within the category designated "other specified countries and areas" under paragraph (b)(i) of additional U.S. note 3 to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States; and c) subject to paragraph 15, the other Party's projected net production surplus for that marketing year, as determined under paragraph 13 and adjusted in accordance with Appendix 703.2.A.13. 15. Subject to paragraph 16, the duty-free quantity of sugar and syrup goods under paragraph 14(c); shall not exceed the following ceilings: a) for each of the first six marketing years, 25,000 metric tons raw value; b) for the seventh marketing year, 150,000 metric tons raw value; and c) for each of the eighth through 14th marketing years, 110 percent of the previous marketing year's ceiling. 16. Beginning with the seventh marketing year, paragraph 15 shall not apply where, pursuant to paragraph 13, the Parties have determined the exporting Party to be a net surplus producer: a) for any two consecutive marketing years beginning after the date of entry into force of this Agreement; b) for the previous and current marketing years; or c) in the current marketing year and projected it to be a net surplus producer in the next marketing year, unless subsequently the Parties determine that, contrary to the projection, the exporting Party was not a net surplus producer for that year. 17. Mexico shall, beginning no later than six years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, apply on a most- favored-nation (MFN) basis a tariff rate quota for sugar and syrup goods consisting of rates of customs duties no less than the lesser of the corresponding: a) MFN rates of the United States in effect on the date that Mexico commences to apply the tariff rate quota; and b) prevailing MFN rates of the United States. 18. When Mexico applies a tariff rate quota under paragraph 17, it shall not apply on a sugar or syrup good that is a qualifying good a rate of customs duty higher than the rate of customs duty applied by the United States on such good. 19. Each Party shall determine the quantity of a sugar or syrup good that is a qualifying good based on the actual weight of such good, converted as appropriate to raw value, without regard to the good's packaging or presentation. 20. If the United States eliminates its tariff rate quota for sugar and syrup goods imported from non-Parties, at such time the United States shall accord to such goods that are qualifying goods the better of the treatment, as determined by Mexico, of: a) the treatment provided for in paragraphs 14 through 16; or b) the MFN treatment granted by the United States to non-Parties. 21. Except as provided in paragraph 22, Mexico shall not be required to apply the applicable rate of customs duty provided in this Annex or in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 to a sugar or syrup good, or sugar-containing product, that is a qualifying good where the United States has granted or will grant benefits under any re-export program or any like program in connection with the export of the good. The United States shall notify Mexico in writing within two days, excluding weekends, of any export to Mexico of such a good for which the benefits of any re-export program or any other like program have been or will be claimed by the exporter. 22. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section: a) the United States shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of (i) raw sugar that is a qualifying good that will be refined in the territory of the United States and re-exported to the territory of Mexico, and (ii) refined sugar that is a qualifying good that has been refined from raw sugar produced in, and exported from, the territory of the United States; b) Mexico shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of (i) raw sugar that is a qualifying good that will be refined in the territory of Mexico and re-exported to the territory of the United States, and (ii) refined sugar that is a qualifying good that has been refined from raw sugar produced in, and exported from, the territory of Mexico; and c) imports qualifying for duty-free treatment pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall not be subject to, or counted under, any tariff rate quota. Agricultural Grading and Marketing Standards. 23. Where a Party adopts or maintains a measure respecting the classification, grading or marketing of a domestic agricultural good, it shall accord treatment to a like qualifying good destined for processing no less favorable than it accords under the measure to the domestic good destined for processing. The importing Party may adopt or maintain measures to ensure that such imported good is processed. 24. Paragraph 23 shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party under the GATT or under Chapter Three (National Treatment and Market Access) regarding measures respecting the classification, grading or marketing of an agricultural good, whether or not destined for processing. 25. The Parties hereby establish a Working Group, comprising representatives of Mexico and the United States, which shall meet annually or as otherwise agreed.

Notwithstanding Chapter Four (Rules of Origin), Canada may treat a good provided for in Canadian tariff item 1806.10.10 or 2106.90.21 that is exported from the territory of Mexico as non-originating for purposes of applying a rate of customs duty to that good, if any material provided for in HS subheading 1701.99 used in the production of such good is not a qualifying good. Trade in Sugar 11. Mexico shall apply a rate of customs duty equal to its most-favored-nation over-quota tariff rate to a sugar or syrup that is a qualifying good. 12. Canada may apply a rate of customs duty on a sugar or syrup good that is a qualifying good equal to the rate of customs duty applied by Mexico pursuant to paragraph 11. Agricultural Grading and Marketing Standards 13. The Parties hereby establish a Working Group, comprising representatives of Canada and Mexico, which shall meet annually or as otherwise agreed. The Working Group shall review, in coordination with the Committee on Standards-Related Measures established under ARTICLE 913 (Committee on Standards-Related Measures), the operation of agricultural grade and quality standards as they affect trade between the Parties, and shall resolve issues that may arise regarding the operation of the standards. This Working Group shall report to the Committee on Agricultural Trade established under Article 706. Definitions 14.

Disguised Restrictions 6. No Party may adopt, maintain or apply any sanitary or phytosanitary measure with a view to, or with the effect of, creating a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties. Article 713: International Standards and Standardizing Organizations 1. Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, each Partyshall use, as a basis for its sanitary and phytosanitary measures, relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations with the objective, among others, of making its sanitary and phytosanitary measures equivalent or, where appropriate, identical to those of the other Parties. 2. A Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure that conforms to a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 712. A measure that results in a level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection different from that which would be achieved by a measure based on a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation shall not for that reason alone be presumed to be inconsistent with this Section. 3. Nothing in Paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or applying, in accordance with the other provisions of this Section, a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that is more stringent than the relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation. 4. Where a Party has reason to believe that a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of another Party is adversely affecting or may adversely affect its exports and the measure is not based on a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation, it may request, and the other Party shall provide in writing, the reasons for the measure. 5. Each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, participate in relevant international and North American standardizing organizations, including the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Office of Epizootics, the International Plant Protection Convention, and the North American Plant Protection Organization, with a view to promoting the development and periodic review of international standards, guidelines and recommendations. Article 714: Equivalence 1. Without reducing the level of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable and in accordance with this Section, pursue equivalence of their respective sanitary and phytosanitary measures. 2. Each importing Party: a) shall treat a sanitary or phytosanitary measure adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, provides to the importing Party scientific evidence or other information, in accordance with risk assessment methodologies agreed on by those Parties, to demonstrate objectively, subject to subparagraph (b), that the exporting Party's measure achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection; b) may, where it has a scientific basis, determine that the exporting Party's measure does not achieve the importing Party's appropriate level of protection; and c) shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for a determination under subparagraph (b). 3. 4. For purposes of establishing equivalence, each exporting Party shall, on the request of an importing Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures. 4. Each Party should, in the development of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, consider relevant actual or proposed sanitary or phytosanitary measures of the other Parties. ARTICLE 715: Risk Assessment and Appropriate Level of Protection 1. In conducting a risk assessment, each Party shall take into account: a) relevant risk assessment techniques and methodologies developed by international or North American standardizing organizations; b) relevant scientific evidence; c) relevant processes and production methods; d) relevant inspection, sampling and testing methods; e) the prevalence of relevant diseases or pests, including the existence of pest- free or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence; f) relevant ecological and other environmental conditions; and g) relevant treatments, such as quarantines. 2. Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in establishing its appropriate level of protection regarding the risk associated with the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease, and in assessing the risk, also take into account the following economic factors, where relevant: a) loss of production or sales that may result from the pest or disease; b) costs of control or eradication of the pest or disease in its territory; and c) the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to limiting risks. 3. Each Party, in establishing its appropriate level of protection: a) should take into account the objective of minimizing negative trade effects; and b) shall, with the objective of achieving consistency in such levels, avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in such levels in different circumstances, where such distinctions result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against a good of another Party or constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties. 4. 5. Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (3) and Article 712(3)(c), where a Party conducting a risk assessment determines that available relevant scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional sanitary or phytosanitary measure on the basis of available relevant information, including from international or North American standardizing organizations and from sanitary or phytosanitary measures of other Parties. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional measure in the light of the assessment. 5. Where a Party is able to achieve its appropriate level of protection through the phased application of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, it may, on the request of another Party and in accordance with this Section, allow for such a phased application, or grant specified exceptions for limited periods from the measure, taking into account the requesting Party's export interests. ARTICLE 716: Adaptation to Regional Conditions 1. Each Party shall adapt any of its sanitary or phytosanitary measures relating to the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease, to the sanitary or phytosanitary characteristics of the area where a good subject to such a measure is produced and the area in its territory to which the good is destined, taking into account any relevant conditions, including those relating to transportation and handling, between those areas. In assessing such characteristics of an area, including whether an area is, and is likely to remain, a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease prevalence, each Party shall take into account, among other factors: a) the prevalence of relevant pests or diseases in that area; b) the existence of eradication or control programs in that area; and c) any relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation. 2. Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall, in determining whether an area is a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease prevalence, base its determination on factors such as geography, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance and the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary controls in that area. 3. Each importing Party shall recognize that an area in the territory of the exporting Party is, and is likely to remain, a pest-free or disease-free area or an area of low pest or disease prevalence, where the exporting Party provides to the importing Party scientific evidence or other information sufficient to so demonstrate to the satisfaction of the importing Party. For this purpose, each exporting Party shall provide reasonable access in its territory to the importing Party for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures. 4. Each Party may, in accordance with this Section: a) adopt, maintain or apply a different risk assessment procedure for a pest- free or disease-free area than for an area of low pest or disease prevalence, or b) make a different final determination for the disposition of a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area than for a good produced in an area of low pest or disease prevalence, taking into account any relevant conditions, including those relating to transportation and handling. 5. 6. Each Party shall, in adopting, maintaining or applying a sanitary or phytosanitary measure relating to the introduction, establishment or spread of an animal or plant pest or disease, accord a good produced in a pest-free or disease-free area in the territory of another Party no less favorable treatment than it accords a good produced in a pest-free or disease- free area, in another country, that poses the same level of risk. The Party shall use equivalent risk assessment techniques to evaluate relevant conditions and controls in the pest-free or disease- free area and in the area surrounding that area and take into account any relevant conditions, including those relating to transportation and handling. 6. Each importing Party shall pursue an agreement with an exporting Party, on request, on specific requirements the fulfillment of which allows a good produced in an area of low pest or disease prevalence in the territory of an exporting Party to be imported into the territory of the importing Party and achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of protection. ARTICLE 717: Control, Inspection and Approval Procedures 1. Each Party, with respect to any control or inspection procedure that it conducts: (a) shall initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible and in no less favorable manner for a good of another Party than for a like good of the Party or of any other country; (b) shall publish the normal processing period for the procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to the applicant on request; (c) shall ensure that the competent body (i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency, (ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action, (iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure if the applicant so requests, and (iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay; (d) shall limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary for conducting the procedure; (e) shall accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the procedure conducted for a good of another Party (i) treatment no less favorable than for a good of the Party, and (ii) in any event, treatment that protects the applicant's legitimate commercial interests, to the extent provided under the Party's law; (f) shall limit any requirement regarding individual specimens or samples of a good to that which is reasonable and necessary; (g) should not impose a fee for conducting the procedure that is higher for a good of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee it imposes for its like goods or for like goods of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs; (h) should use criteria for selecting the location of facilities at which the procedure is conducted that do not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent; (i) shall provide a mechanism to review complaints concerning the operation of the procedure and to take corrective action when a complaint is justified; (j) should use criteria for selecting samples of goods that do not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent; and (k) shall limit the procedure, for a good modified subsequent to a determination that the good fulfills the requirements of the applicable sanitary or phytosanitary measure, to that necessary to determine that the good continues to fulfill the requirements of that measure. 2. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, paragraphs 1(a) through (i) to its approval procedures. 3. Where an importing Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure requires the conduct of a control or inspection procedure at the level of production, an exporting Party shall, on the request of the importing Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory and to provide assistance necessary to facilitate the conduct of the importing Party's control or inspection procedure. 4. A Party maintaining an approval procedure may require its approval for the use of an additive, or its establishment of a tolerance for a contaminant, in a food, beverage or feedstuff, under that procedure prior to granting access to its domestic market for a food, beverage or feedstuff containing that additive or contaminant. Where such Party so requires, it shall consider using a relevant international standard, guideline or recommendation as the basis for granting access until it completes the procedure. ARTICLE 718: Notification, Publication and Provision of Information 1. Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803 (Notification and Provision of Information), each Party proposing to adopt or modify a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of general application at the federal level shall: (a) at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, other than a law, publish a notice and notify in writing the other Parties of the proposed measure and provide to the other Parties and publish the full text of the proposed measure, in such a manner as to enable interested persons to become acquainted with the proposed measure; (b) identify in the notice and notification the good to which the measure would apply, and provide a brief description of the objective and reasons for the measure; (c) provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party or interested person that so requests and, wherever possible, identify any provision that deviates in substance from relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations; and (d) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account. 2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure, with respect to a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of a state or provincial government: (a) that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and notification of the type referred to in paragraphs 1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and (b) observance of paragraphs 1(c) and (d). 3. Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent problem relating to sanitary or phytosanitary protection, it may omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 2, provided that, on adoption of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, it shall: (a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification of the type referred to in paragraph 1(b), including a brief description of the urgent problem; (b) provide a copy of the measure to any Party or interested person that so requests; and (c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account. 4. Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an urgent problem referred to in paragraph 3, allow a reasonable period between the publication of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of general application and the date that it becomes effective to allow time for interested persons to adapt to the measure. 5. Each Party shall designate a government authority responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the other Parties thereof. Where a Party designates two or more government authorities for this purpose, it shall provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each such authority. 6. Where an importing Party denies entry into its territory of a good of another Party because it does not comply with a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, the importing Party shall provide a written explanation to the exporting Party, on request, that identifies the applicable measure and the reasons that the good is not in compliance. ARTICLE 719: Inquiry Points 1. Each Party shall ensure that there is one inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons, and to provide relevant documents, regarding: (a) any sanitary or phytosanitary measure of general application, including any control or inspection procedure or approval procedure, proposed, adopted or maintained in its territory at the federal, state or provincial government level; (b) the Party's risk assessment procedures and factors it considers in conducting the assessment and in establishing its appropriate levels of protection; (c) the membership and participation of the Party, or its relevant federal, state or provincial government authorities in international and regional sanitary and phytosanitary organizations and systems, and in bilateral and multilateral arrangements within the scope of this Section, and the provisions of those systems and arrangements; and (d) the location of notices published pursuant to this Section or where such information can be obtained. 2. Each Party shall ensure that where copies of documents are requested by another Party or by interested persons in accordance with this Section, they are supplied at the same price, apart from the actual cost of delivery, as the price for domestic purchase. ARTICLE 720: Technical Cooperation 1. Each Party shall, on the request of another Party, facilitate the provision of technical advice, information and assistance, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, to enhance that Party's sanitary and phytosanitary measures and related activities, including research, processing technologies, infrastructure and the establishment of national regulatory bodies. Such assistance may include credits, donations and grants for the acquisition of technical expertise, training and equipment that will facilitate the Party's adjustment to and compliance with a Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure. 2. Each Party shall, on the request of another Party: (a) provide to that Party information on its technical cooperation programs regarding sanitary or phytosanitary measures relating to specific areas of interest; and (b) consult with the other Party during the development of, or prior to the adoption or change in the application of, any sanitary or phytosanitary measure. ARTICLE 721: Limitations on the Provision of Information Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require a Party to: (a) communicate, publish texts or provide particulars or copies of documents other than in an official language of the Party; or (b) furnish any information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises. ARTICLE 722: Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, comprising representatives of each Party who have responsibility for sanitary and phytosanitary matters. 2. The Committee should facilitate: (a) the enhancement of food safety and improvement of sanitary and phytosanitary conditions in the territories of the Parties; (b) activities of the Parties pursuant to Articles 713 and 714; (c) technical cooperation between the Parties, including cooperation in the development, application and enforcement of sanitary or phytosanitary measures; and (d) consultations on specific matters relating to sanitary or phytosanitary measures. 3. The Committee: (a) shall, to the extent possible, in carrying out its functions, seek the assistance of relevant international and North American standardizing organizations to obtain available scientific and technical advice and minimize duplication of effort; (b) may draw on such experts and expert bodies as it considers appropriate; (c) shall report annually to the Commission on the implementation of this Section; (d) shall meet on the request of any Party and, unless the Parties otherwise agree, at least once each year; and (e) may, as it considers appropriate, establish and determine the scope and mandate of working groups. ARTICLE 723: Technical Consultations 1. A Party may request consultations with another Party on any matter covered by this Section. 2. Each Party should use the good offices of relevant international and North American standardizing organizations, including those referred to in Article 713(5), for advice and assistance on sanitary and phytosanitary matters within their respective mandates. 3. Where a Party requests consultations regarding the application of this Section to a Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure, and so notifies the Committee, the Committee may facilitate the consultations, if it does not consider the matter itself, by referring the matter for non-binding technical advice or recommendations to a working group, including an ad hoc working group, or to another forum. 4. The Committee should consider any matter referred to it under paragraph 3 as expeditiously as possible, particularly regarding perishable goods, and promptly forward to the Parties any technical advice or recommendations that it develops or receives concerning the matter. The Parties involved shall provide a written response to the Committee concerning the technical advice or recommendations within such time as the Committee may request. 5. Where the involved Parties have had recourse to consultations facilitated by the Committee under paragraph 3, the consultations shall, on the agreement of the Parties involved, constitute consultations under Article 2006 (Consultations). 6. The Parties confirm that a Party asserting that a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of another Party is inconsistent with this Section shall have the burden of establishing the inconsistency. ARTICLE 724: Definitions For purposes of this Section: animal includes fish and wild fauna; appropriate level of protection means the level of protection of human, animal or plant life or health in the territory of a Party that the Party considers appropriate; approval procedure means any registration, notification or other mandatory administrative procedure for: (a) approving the use of an additive for a stated purpose or under stated conditions; or (b) establishing a tolerance for a stated purpose or under stated conditions for a contaminant, in a food, beverage or feedstuff prior to permitting the use of the additive or the marketing of a food, beverage or feedstuff containing the additive or contaminant; area means a country, part of a country or all or parts of several countries; area of low pest or disease prevalence means an area in which a specific pest or disease occurs at low levels; contaminant includes pesticide and veterinary drug residues and extraneous matter; control or inspection procedure means any procedure used, directly or indirectly, to determine that a sanitary or phytosanitary measure is fulfilled, including sampling, testing, inspection, evaluation, verification, monitoring, auditing, assurance of conformity, accreditation, registration, certification or other procedure involving the physical examination of a good, of the packaging of a good, or of the equipment or facilities directly related to production, marketing or use of a good, but does not mean an approval procedure; international standard, guideline or recommendation means a standard, guideline or recommendation: (a) regarding food safety, adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, including one regarding decomposition elaborated by the Codex Committee on Fish and Fishery Products, food additives, contaminants, hygienic practice, and methods of analysis and sampling; (b) regarding animal health and zoonoses, developed under the auspices of the International Office of Epizootics; (c) regarding plant health, developed under the auspices of the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention in cooperation with the North American Plant Protection Organization; or (d) established by or developed under any other international organization agreed on by the Parties; pest includes a weed; pest-free or disease-free area means an area in which a specific pest or disease does not occur; plant includes wild flora; risk assessment means an evaluation of: (a) the potential for the introduction, establishment or spread of a pest or disease and associated biological and economic consequences; or (b) the potential for adverse effects on human or animal life or health arising from the presence of an additive, contaminant, toxin or disease-causing organism in a food, beverage or feedstuff; sanitary or phytosanitary measure means a measure that a Party adopts, maintains or applies to: (a) protect animal or plant life or health in its territory from risks arising from the introduction, establishment or spread of a pest or disease, (b) protect human or animal life or health in its territory from risks arising from the presence of an additive, contaminant, toxin or disease-causing organism in a food, beverage or feedstuff, (c) protect human life or health in its territory from risks arising from a disease- causing organism or pest carried by an animal or plant, or a product thereof, or (d) prevent or limit other damage in its territory arising from the introduction, establishment or spread of a pest, including end product criteria; a product-related processing or production method; a testing, inspection, certification or approval procedure; a relevant statistical method; a sampling procedure; a method of risk assessment; a packaging and labelling requirement directly related to food safety; and a quarantine treatment, such as a relevant requirement associated with the transportation of animals or plants or with material necessary for their survival during transportation; and scientific basis means a reason based on data or information derived using scientific methods. CHAPTER EIGHT: EMERGENCY ACTION Article 801: Bilateral Actions 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 through 4 and Annex 801.1, and during the transition period only, if a good originating in the territory of a Party, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this Agreement, is being imported into the territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms, and under such conditions that the imports of the good from that Party alone constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the Party into whose territory the good is being imported may, to the minimum extent necessary to remedy or prevent the injury: (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty provided for under this Agreement on the good; (b) increase the rate of duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of (i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty in effect at the time the action is taken, and (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement; or (c) in the case of a duty applied to a good on a seasonal basis, increase the rate of duty to a level not to exceed the MFN applied rate of duty that was in effect on the good for the corresponding season immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 2. The following conditions and limitations shall apply to a proceeding that may result in emergency action under paragraph 1: (a) a Party shall, without delay, deliver to any Party that may be affected written notice of, and a request for consultations regarding, the institution of a proceeding that could result in emergency action against a good originating in the territory of a Party; (b) any such action shall be initiated no later than one year after the date of institution of the proceeding; (c) no action may be maintained (i) for a period exceeding three years, except where the good against which the action is taken is provided for in the items in staging category C+ of the Schedule to Annex 302.2 of the Party taking the action and that Party determines that the affected industry has undertaken adjustment and requires an extension of the period of relief, in which case the period of relief may be extended for one year provided that the duty applied during the initial period of relief is substantially reduced at the beginning of the extension period, or (ii) beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the consent of the Party against whose good the action is taken; (d) no action may be taken by a Party against any particular good originating in the territory of another Party more than once during the transition period; and (e) on the termination of the action, the rate of duty shall be the rate that, according to the Party's Schedule to Annex 302.2 for the staged elimination of the tariff, would have been in effect one year after the initiation of the action, and beginning January 1 of the year following the termination of the action, at the option of the Party that has taken the action (i) the rate of duty shall conform to the applicable rate set out in its Schedule to Annex 302.2, or (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual stages ending on the date set out in its Schedule to Annex 302.2 for the elimination of the tariff. 3. A Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the expiration of the transition period to deal with cases of serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry arising from the operation of this Agreement only with the consent of the Party against whose good the action would be taken. 4. The Party taking an action under this Article shall provide to the Party against whose good the action is taken mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the action. If the Parties concerned are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose good the action is taken may take tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken under this Article. The Party taking the tariff action shall apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects. 5. This Article does not apply to emergency actions respecting goods covered by Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods). ARTICLE 802: Global Actions 1. Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of the GATT or any safeguard agreement pursuant thereto except those regarding compensation or retaliation and exclusion from an action to the extent that such rights or obligations are inconsistent with this Article. Any Party taking an emergency action under Article XIX or any such agreement shall exclude imports of a good from each other Party from the action unless: (a) imports from a Party, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports; and (b) imports from a Party, considered individually, or in exceptional circumstances imports from Parties considered collectively, contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports. 2. In determining whether: (a) imports from a Party, considered individually, account for a substantial share of total imports, those imports normally shall not be considered to account for a substantial share of total imports if that Party is not among the top five suppliers of the good subject to the proceeding, measured in terms of import share during the most recent three-year period; and (b) imports from a Party or Parties contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, the competent investigating authority shall consider such factors as the change in the import share of each Party, and the level and change in the level of imports of each Party. In this regard, imports from a Party normally shall not be deemed to contribute importantly to serious injury, or the threat thereof, if the growth rate of imports from a Party during the period in which the injurious surge in imports occurred is appreciably lower than the growth rate of total imports from all sources over the same period. 3. A Party taking such action, from which a good from another Party or Parties is initially excluded pursuant to paragraph 1, shall have the right subsequently to include that good from the other Party or Parties in the action in the event that the competent investigating authority determines that a surge in imports of such good from the other Party or Parties undermines the effectiveness of the action. 4. A Party shall, without delay, deliver written notice to the other Parties of the institution of a proceeding that may result in emergency action under paragraph 1 or 3. 5. No Party may impose restrictions on a good in an action under paragraph 1 or 3: (a) without delivery of prior written notice to the Commission, and without adequate opportunity for consultation with the Party or Parties against whose good the action is proposed to be taken, as far in advance of taking the action as practicable; and (b) that would have the effect of reducing imports of such good from a Party below the trend of imports of the good from that Party over a recent representative base period with allowance for reasonable growth. 6. 7. The Party taking an action pursuant to this Article shall provide to the Party or Parties against whose good the action is taken mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the action. If the Parties concerned are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose good the action is taken may take action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken under paragraph 1 or 3. ARTICLE 803: Administration of Emergency Action Proceedings 1. Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and reasonable administration of its laws, regulations, decisions and rulings governing all emergency action proceedings. 2. Each Party shall entrust determinations of serious injury, or threat thereof, in emergency action proceedings to a competent investigating authority, subject to review by judicial or administrative tribunals, to the extent provided by domestic law. Negative injury determinations shall not be subject to modification, except by such review. The competent investigating authority empowered under domestic law to conduct such proceedings should be provided with the necessary resources to enable it to fulfill its duties. 3. Each Party shall adopt or maintain equitable, timely, transparent and effective procedures for emergency action proceedings, in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex 803.3. 4. This Article does not apply to emergency actions taken under Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods). ARTICLE 804: Dispute Settlement in Emergency Action Matters No Party may request the establishment of an arbitral panel under Article 2008 (Request for an Arbitral Panel) regarding any proposed emergency action. ARTICLE 805: Definitions For purposes of this Chapter: competent investigating authority means the "competent investigating authority" of a Party as defined in Annex 805; contribute importantly means an important cause, but not necessarily the most important cause; critical circumstances means circumstances where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to repair; domestic industry means the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive good operating in the territory of a Party; emergency action does not include any emergency action pursuant to a proceeding instituted prior to January 1, 1994; good originating in the territory of a Party means an originating good, except that in determining the Party in whose territory that good originates, the relevant rules of Annex 302.2 shall apply; serious injury means a significant overall impairment of a domestic industry; surge means a significant increase in imports over the trend for a recent representative base period; threat of serious injury means serious injury that, on the basis of facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility, is clearly imminent; and transition period means the 10-year period beginning on January 1, 1994, except where the good against which the action is taken is provided for in the items in staging category C+ of the Schedule to Annex 302.2 of the Party taking the action, in which case the transition period shall be the period of staged tariff elimination for that good. Annex 801.1: Bilateral Actions 1. Notwithstanding Article 801, bilateral emergency actions between Canada and the United States on goods originating in the territory of either Party, other than goods covered by Annex 300-B (Textile and Apparel Goods), shall be governed in accordance with the terms of Article 1101 of the Canada - United States Free Trade Agreement, which is hereby Incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement for such purpose. 2. For such purposes, "good originating in the territory of one Party" means "good originating in the territory of a Party" as defined in Article 805. Annex 803.3: Administration of Emergency Action Proceedings Institution of a Proceeding 1. An emergency action proceeding may be instituted by a petition or complaint by entities specified in domestic law. The entity filing the petition or complaint shall demonstrate that it is representative of the domestic industry producing a good like or directly competitive with the imported good. 2. A Party may institute a proceeding on its own motion or request the competent investigating authority to conduct a proceeding. Contents of a Petition or Complaint 3. Where the basis for an investigation is a petition or complaint filed by an entity representative of a domestic industry, the petitioning entity shall, in its petition or complaint, provide the following information to the extent that such information is publicly available from governmental or other sources, or best estimates and the basis therefor if such information is not available: (a) product description - the name and description of the imported good concerned, the tariff subheading under which that good is classified, its current tariff treatment and the name and description of the like or directly competitive domestic good concerned; (b) representativeness - (i) the names and addresses of the entities filing the petition or complaint, and the locations of the establishments in which they produce the domestic good, (ii) the percentage of domestic production of the like or directly competitive good that such entities account for and the basis for claiming that they are representative of an industry, and (iii) the names and locations of all other domestic establishments in which the like or directly competitive good is produced; (c) import data - import data for each of the five most recent full years that form the basis of the claim that the good concerned is being imported in increased quantities, either in absolute terms or relative to domestic production as appropriate; (d) domestic production data - data on total domestic production of the like or directly competitive good for each of the five most recent full years; (e) data showing injury - quantitative and objective data indicating the nature and extent of injury to the concerned industry, such as data showing changes in the level of sales, prices, production, productivity, capacity utilization, market share, profits and losses, and employment; (f) cause of injury - an enumeration and description of the alleged causes of the injury, or threat thereof, and a summary of the basis for the assertion that increased imports, either actual or relative to domestic production, of the imported good are causing or threatening to cause serious injury, supported by pertinent data; and (g) criteria for inclusion - quantitative and objective data indicating the share of imports accounted for by imports from the territory of each other Party and the petitioner's views on the extent to which such imports are contributing importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports of that good. 4. Petitions or complaints, except to the extent that they contain confidential business information, shall promptly be made available for public inspection on being filed. Notice Requirement 5. On instituting an emergency action proceeding, the competent investigating authority shall publish notice of the institution of the proceeding in the official journal of the Party. The notice shall identify the petitioner or other requester, the imported good that is the subject of the proceeding and its tariff subheading, the nature and timing of the determination to be made, the time and place of the public hearing, dates of deadlines for filing briefs, statements and other documents, the place at which the petition and any other documents filed in the course of the proceeding may be inspected, and the name, address and telephone number of the office to be contacted for more information. 6. With respect to an emergency action proceeding instituted on the basis of a petition or complaint filed by an entity asserting that it is representative of the domestic industry, the competent investigating authority shall not publish the notice required by paragraph 5 without first assessing carefully that the petition or complaint meets the requirements of paragraph 3, including representativeness. Public Hearing 7. In the course of each proceeding, the competent investigating authority shall: (a) hold a public hearing, after providing reasonable notice, to allow all interested parties, and any association whose purpose is to represent the interests of consumers in the territory of the Party instituting the proceeding, to appear in person or by counsel, to present evidence and to be heard on the questions of serious injury, or threat thereof, and the appropriate remedy; and (b) provide an opportunity to all interested parties and any such association appearing at the hearing to cross-question interested parties making presentations at that hearing. Confidential Information 8. The competent investigating authority shall adopt or maintain procedures for the treatment of confidential information, protected under domestic law, that is provided in the course of a proceeding, including a requirement that interested parties and consumer associations providing such information furnish non-confidential written summaries thereof, or where they indicate that the information cannot be summarized, the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. Evidence of Injury and Causation 9. In conducting its proceeding the competent investigating authority shall gather, to the best of its ability, all relevant information appropriate to the determination it must make. It shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of that industry, including the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the good concerned, in absolute and relative terms as appropriate, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports, and changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilization, profits and losses, and employment. In making its determination, the competent investigating authority may also consider other economic factors, such as changes in prices and inventories, and the ability of firms in the industry to generate capital. 10. The competent investigating authority shall not make an affirmative injury determination unless its investigation demonstrates, on the basis of objective evidence, the existence of a clear causal link between increased imports of the good concerned and serious injury, or threat thereof. Where factors other than increased imports are causing injury to the domestic industry at the same time, such injury shall not be attributed to increased imports. Deliberation and Report 11. Except in critical circumstances and in global actions involving perishable agricultural goods, the competent investigating authority, before making an affirmative determination in an emergency action proceeding, shall allow sufficient time to gather and consider the relevant information, hold a public hearing and provide an opportunity for all interested parties and consumer associations to prepare and submit their views. 12. The competent investigating authority shall publish promptly a report, including a summary thereof in the official journal of the Party, setting out its findings and reasoned conclusions on all pertinent issues of law and fact. The report shall describe the imported good and its tariff item number, the standard applied and the finding made. The statement of reasons shall set out the basis for the determination, including a description of: (a) the domestic industry seriously injured or threatened with serious injury; (b) information supporting a finding that imports are increasing, the domestic industry is seriously injured or threatened with serious injury, and increasing imports are causing or threatening serious injury; and (c) if provided for by domestic law, any finding or recommendation regarding the appropriate remedy and the basis therefor. 13. In its report, the competent investigating authority shall not disclose any confidential information provided pursuant to any undertaking concerning confidential information that may have been made in the course of the proceedings. Annex 805: Country-Specific Definitions For purposes of this Chapter: competent investigating authority means: (a) in the case of Canada, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, or its successor; (b) in the case of the Mexico, the designated authority within the Ministry of Trade and Industrial Development ("Secretaría de Comercio y Fomento Industrial"), or its successor; and (c) in the case of the United States, the U.S. International Trade Commission, or its successor. PART THREE TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE CHAPTER NINE: STANDARDS-RELATED MEASURES ARTICLE 901: Scope and Coverage 1. This Chapter applies to standards-related measures of a Party, other than those covered by Section B of Chapter Seven (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between the Parties, and to measures of the Parties relating to such measures. 2. Technical specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of such bodies shall be governed exclusively by Chapter Ten (Government Procurement). Article 902: Extent of Obligations 1. Article 105 (Extent of Obligations) does not apply to this Chapter. 2. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure observance of Articles 904 through 908 by state or provincial governments and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory. ARTICLE 903: Affirmation of Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and Other Agreements Further to Article 103 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm with respect to each other their existing rights and obligations relating to standards-related measures under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and all other international agreements, including environmental and conservation agreements, to which those Parties are party. ARTICLE 904: Basic Rights and Obligations Right to Take Standards-Related Measures 1. Each Party may, in accordance with this Agreement, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure, including any such measure relating to safety, the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, and any measure to ensure its enforcement or implementation. Such measures include those to prohibit the importation of a good of another Party or the provision of a service by a service provider of another Party that fails to comply with the applicable requirements of those measures or to complete the Party's approval procedures. Right to Establish Level of Protection 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives of safety or the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 907(2). Non-Discriminatory Treatment 3. Each Party shall, in respect of its standards-related measures, accord to goods and service providers of another Party: (a) national treatment in accordance with Article 301 (Market Access) or Article 1202 (Cross-Border Trade in Services); and (b) treatment no less favorable than that it accords to like goods, or in like circumstances to service providers, of any other country. Unnecessary Obstacles 4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where: (a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; and (b) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of another Party that meet that legitimate objective. ARTICLE 905: Use of International Standards 1. Each Party shall use, as a basis for its standards-related measures, relevant international standards or international standards whose completion is imminent, except where such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means to fulfill its legitimate objectives, for example because of fundamental climatic, geographical, technological or infrastructural factors, scientific justification or the level of protection that the Party considers appropriate. 2. A Party's standards-related measure that conforms to an international standard shall be presumed to be consistent with Article 904(3) and (4). 3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, from adopting, maintaining or applying any standards-related measure that results in a higher level of protection than would be achieved if the measure were based on the relevant international standard. ARTICLE 906: Compatibility and Equivalence 1. Recognizing the crucial role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers. 2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of any Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures, so as to facilitate trade in a good or service between the Parties. 3. Further to Articles 902 and 905, a Party shall, on request of another Party, seek, through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard or conformity assessment procedure that is maintained in its territory with the standards or conformity assessment procedures maintained in the territory of the other Party. 4. Each importing Party shall treat a technical regulation adopted or maintained by an exporting Party as equivalent to its own where the exporting Party, in cooperation with the importing Party, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the importing Party that its technical regulation adequately fulfills the importing Party's legitimate objectives. 5. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party, on request, its reasons in writing for not treating a technical regulation as equivalent under paragraph 4. 6. Each Party shall, wherever possible, accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, provided that it is satisfied that the procedure offers an assurance, equivalent to that provided by a procedure it conducts or a procedure conducted in its territory the results of which it accepts, that the relevant good or service complies with the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the Party's territory. 7. Prior to accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 6, and to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of each other's conformity assessment results, the Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of the conformity assessment bodies involved, including verified compliance with relevant international standards through such means as accreditation. ARTICLE 907: Assessment of Risk 1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service: (a) available scientific evidence or technical information; (b) intended end uses; (c) processes or production, operating, inspection, sampling or testing methods; or (d) environmental conditions. 2. Where pursuant to Article 904(2) a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions: (a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of another Party; (b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or (c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits. 3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, it may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment. ARTICLE 908: Conformity Assessment 1. The Parties shall, further to Article 906 and recognizing the existence of substantial differences in the structure, organization and operation of conformity assessment procedures in their respective territories, make compatible those procedures to the greatest extent practicable. 2. Recognizing that it should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties concerned and except as set out in Annex 908.2, each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of another Party on terms no less favorable than those accorded to conformity assessment bodies in its territory. 3. Each Party shall, with respect to its conformity assessment procedures: (a) not adopt or maintain any such procedure that is stricter, nor apply the procedure more strictly, than necessary to give it confidence that a good or a service conforms with an applicable technical regulation or standard, taking into account the risks that non-conformity would create; (b) initiate and complete the procedure as expeditiously as possible; (c) in accordance with Article 904(3), undertake processing of applications in non- discriminatory order; (d) publish the normal processing period for each such procedure or communicate the anticipated processing period to an applicant on request; (e) ensure that the competent body (i) on receipt of an application, promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of any deficiency, (ii) transmits to the applicant as soon as possible the results of the conformity assessment procedure in a form that is precise and complete so that the applicant may take any necessary corrective action, (iii) where the application is deficient, proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure where the applicant so requests, and (iv) informs the applicant, on request, of the status of the application and the reasons for any delay; (f) limit the information the applicant is required to supply to that necessary to conduct the procedure and to determine appropriate fees; (g) accord confidential or proprietary information arising from, or supplied in connection with, the conduct of the procedure for a good of another Party or for a service provided by a person of another Party (i) the same treatment as that for a good of the Party or a service provided by a person of the Party, and (ii) in any event, treatment that protects an applicant's legitimate commercial interests to the extent provided under the Party's law; (h) ensure that any fee it imposes for conducting the procedure is no higher for a good of another Party or a service provider of another Party than is equitable in relation to any such fee imposed for its like goods or service providers or for like goods or service providers of any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and other related costs; (i) ensure that the location of facilities at which a conformity assessment procedure is conducted does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent; (j) limit the procedure, for a good or service modified subsequent to a determination that the good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard, to that necessary to determine that the good or service continues to conform to the technical regulation or standard; and (k) limit any requirement regarding samples of a good to that which is reasonable, and ensure that the selection of samples does not cause unnecessary inconvenience to an applicant or its agent. 4. Each Party shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, the relevant provisions of paragraph 3 to its approval procedures. 5. Each Party shall, on request of another Party, take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to facilitate access in its territory for conformity assessment activities. 6. Each Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a request by another Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual recognition of the results of that other Party's conformity assessment procedures. Article 909: Notification, Publication, and Provision of Information 1. Further to Articles 1802 (Publication) and 1803 (Notification and Provision of Information), each Party proposing to adopt or modify a technical regulation shall: (a) at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, other than a law, publish a notice and notify in writing the other Parties of the proposed measure in such a manner as to enable interested persons to become acquainted with the proposed measure, except that in the case of any such measure relating to perishable goods, each Party shall, to the greatest extent practicable, publish the notice and provide the notification at least 30 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, but no later than when notification is provided to domestic producers; (b) identify in the notice and notification the good or service to which the measure would apply, and shall provide a brief description of the objective of, and reasons for the measure; (c) provide a copy of the proposed measure to any Party or interested person that so requests, and shall, wherever possible, identify any provision that deviates in substance from relevant international standards; and (d) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account. 2. Each Party proposing to adopt or modify a standard or any conformity assessment procedure not otherwise considered to be a technical regulation shall, where an international standard relevant to the proposed measure does not exist or such measure is not substantially the same as an international standard, and where the measure may have a significant effect on the trade of the other Parties: (a) at an early appropriate stage, publish a notice and provide a notification of the type required in paragraph 1(a) and (b); and (b) observe paragraph (c) and (d). 3. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure, with respect to a technical regulation of a state or provincial government other than a local government: (a) that, at an early appropriate stage, a notice and notification of the type required under paragraph 1(a) and (b) are made prior to their adoption; and (b) observance of paragraph (c) and (d). 4. Where a Party considers it necessary to address an urgent problem relating to safety or to protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, it may omit any step set out in paragraph 1 or 3, provided that on adoption of a standards- related measure it shall: (a) immediately provide to the other Parties a notification of the type required under paragraph 1(b), including a brief description of the urgent problem; (b) provide a copy of the measure to any Party or interested person that so requests; and (c) without discrimination, allow other Parties and interested persons to make comments in writing, and shall, on request, discuss the comments and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account. 5. Each Party shall, except where necessary to address an urgent problem referred to in paragraph 4, allow a reasonable period between the publication of a standards-related measure and the date that it becomes effective to allow time for interested persons to adapt to the measure. 6. Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its territory to be present during the process of development of standards-related measures, it shall also allow non- governmental persons from the territories of the other Parties to be present. 7. Each Party shall notify the other Parties of the development of, amendment to, or change in the application of its standards-related measures no later than the time at which it notifies non-governmental persons in general or the relevant sector in its territory. 8. Each Party shall seek, through appropriate measures, to ensure the observance of paragraphs 6 and 7 by a state or provincial government, and by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory. 9. Each Party shall designate by January 1, 1994 a government authority responsible for the implementation at the federal level of the notification provisions of this Article, and shall notify the other Parties thereof. Where a Party designates two or more government authorities for that purpose, it shall provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each such authority. ARTICLE 910: Inquiry Points 1. Each Party shall ensure that there is an inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons, and to provide relevant documents regarding: (a) any standards-related measure proposed, adopted or maintained in its territory at the federal, state or provincial government level; (b) the membership and participation of the Party, or its relevant federal, state or provincial government authorities, in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems, and in bilateral and multilateral arrangements regarding standards-related measures, and the provisions of those systems and arrangements; (c) the location of notices published pursuant to Article 909, or where the information can be obtained; (d) the location of the inquiry points referred to in paragraph 3; and (e) the Party's procedures for assessment of risk, and factors it considers in conducting the assessment and in establishing, pursuant to Article 904(2), the levels of protection that it considers appropriate. 2. Where a Party designates more than one inquiry point, it shall: (a) provide to the other Parties complete and unambiguous information on the scope of responsibility of each inquiry point; and (b) ensure that any inquiry addressed to an incorrect inquiry point is promptly conveyed to the correct inquiry point. 3. Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure that there is at least one inquiry point that is able to answer all reasonable inquiries from other Parties and interested persons and to provide relevant documents or information as to where they can be obtained regarding: (a) any standard or conformity assessment procedure proposed, adopted or maintained by non-governmental standardizing bodies in its territory; and (b) the membership and participation of relevant non-governmental bodies in its territory in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems. 4. Each Party shall ensure that where copies of documents are requested by another Party or by interested persons in accordance with this Chapter, they are supplied at the same price, apart from the actual cost of delivery, as the price for domestic purchase. ARTICLE 911: Technical Cooperation 1. Each Party shall, on request of another Party: (a) provide to that Party technical advice, information and assistance on mutually agreed terms and conditions to enhance that Party's standards- related measures, and related activities, processes and systems; (b) provide to that Party information on its technical cooperation programs regarding standards-related measures relating to specific areas of interest; and (c) consult with that Party during the development of, or prior to the adoption or change in the application of, any standards-related measure. 2. 3. Each Party shall encourage standardizing bodies in its territory to cooperate with the standardizing bodies in the territories of the other Parties in their participation, as appropriate, in standardizing activities, such as through membership in international standardizing bodies. ARTICLE 912: Limitations on the Provision of Information Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to: (a) communicate, publish texts, or provide particulars or copies of documents other than in an official language of the Party; or (b) furnish any information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.

For each subsequent two-year period beginning January 1, 1996, its conversion rate shall be the average of the weekly values of the Canadian dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar over the two-year period ending September 30 of the year preceding the beginning of each two-year period. 4. Mexico shall use the conversion rate of the Bank of Mexico ("Banco de México").

ARTICLE 1111: Special Formalities and Information Requirements 1. Nothing in Article 1102 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the establishment of investments by investors of another Party, such as a requirement that investors be residents of the Party or that investments be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that such formalities do not materially impair the protections afforded by a Party to investors of another Party and investments of investors of another Party pursuant to this Chapter. 2. Notwithstanding Articles 1102 or 1103, a Party may require an investor of another Party, or its investment in its territory, to provide routine information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes. The Party shall protect such business information that is confidential from any disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the investment. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good faith application of its law. ARTICLE 1112: Relation to Other Chapters 1. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. 2. A requirement by a Party that a service provider of another Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition of providing a service into its territory does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to the provision of that crossborder service. This Chapter applies to that Party's treatment of the posted bond or financial security. ARTICLE 1113: Denial of Benefits 1. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of another Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of such investor if investors of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and the denying Party: (a) does not maintain diplomatic relations with the non-Party; or (b) adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise or to its investments. 2. Subject to prior notification and consultation in accordance with Articles 1803 (Notification and Provision of Information) and 2006 (Consultations), a Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of another Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of such investors if investors of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is constituted or organized. ARTICLE 1114: Environmental Measures 1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns. 2. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such measures as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Party considers that another Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding any such encouragement. Section B Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an Investor of Another Party ARTICLE 1115: Purpose Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under Chapter Twenty (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement Procedures), this Section establishes a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that assures both equal treatment among investors of the Parties in accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and due process before an impartial tribunal.

With respect to an existing visa requirement, a Party shall consult, on request, with a Party whose business persons are subject to the requirement with a view to its removal. Section D – Professionals 1. Each Party shall grant temporary entry and provide confirming documentation to a business person seeking to engage in a business activity at a professional level in a profession set out in Appendix 1603.D.1, if the business person otherwise complies with existing immigration measures applicable to temporary entry, on presentation of: (a) proof of citizenship of a Party; and (b) documentation demonstrating that the business person will be so engaged and describing the purpose of entry. 2. No Party may: (a) as a condition for temporary entry under paragraph 1, require prior approval procedures, petitions, labor certification tests or other procedures of similar effect; or (b) impose or maintain any numerical restriction relating to temporary entry under paragraph 1. 3. 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, a Party may require a business person seeking temporary entry under this Section to obtain a visa or its equivalent prior to entry. Before imposing a visa requirement, the Party shall consult with a Party whose business persons would be affected with a view to avoiding the imposition of the requirement. With respect to an existing visa requirement, a Party shall consult, on request, with a Party whose business persons are subject to the requirement with a view to its removal. 4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may establish an annual numerical limit, which shall be set out in Appendix 1603.D.4, regarding temporary entry of business persons of another Party seeking to engage in business activities at a professional level in a profession set out in Appendix 1603.D.1, if the Parties concerned have not agreed otherwise prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement for those Parties. In establishing such a limit, the Party shall consult with the other Party concerned. 5. A Party establishing a numerical limit pursuant to paragraph 4, unless the Parties concerned agree otherwise: (a) shall, for each year after the first year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, consider increasing the numerical limit set out in Appendix 1603.D.4 by an amount to be established in consultation with the other Party concerned, taking into account the demand for temporary entry under this Section; (b) shall not apply its procedures established pursuant to paragraph 1 to the temporary entry of a business person subject to the numerical limit, but may require the business person to comply with its other procedures applicable to the temporary entry of professionals; and (c) may, in consultation with the other Party concerned, grant temporary entry under paragraph 1 to a business person who practices in a profession where accreditation, licensing, and certification requirements are mutually recognized by those Parties. 6. Nothing in paragraph 4 or 5 shall be construed to limit the ability of a business person to seek temporary entry under a Party's applicable immigration measures relating to the entry of professionals other than those adopted or maintained pursuant to paragraph 1. 7. Three years after a Party establishes a numerical limit pursuant to paragraph 4, it shall consult with the other Party concerned with a view to determining a date after which the limit shall cease to apply.

PART SIX INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARTICLE 1701: Nature and Scope of Obligations 1. Each Party shall provide in its territory to the nationals of another Party adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, while ensuring that measures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves become barriers to legitimate trade. 2. To provide adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall, at a minimum, give effect to this Chapter and to the substantive provisions of: (a) the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms, 1971 (Geneva Convention); (b) the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, 1971 (Berne Convention); (c) the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, 1967 (Paris Convention); and (d) the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, 1978 (UPOV Convention), or the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, 1991 (UPOV Convention). If a Party has not acceded to the specified text of any such Conventions on or before the date of entry into force of this Agreement, it shall make every effort to accede. 3. Annex 1701.3 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex. ARTICLE 1702: More Extensive Protection A Party may implement in its domestic law more extensive protection of intellectual property rights than is required under this Agreement, provided that such protection is not inconsistent with this Agreement. ARTICLE 1703: National Treatment 1. Each Party shall accord to nationals of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights. In respect of sound recordings, each Party shall provide such treatment to producers and performers of another Party, except that a Party may limit rights of performers of another Party in respect of secondary uses of sound recordings to those rights its nationals are accorded in the territory of such other Party. 2. No Party may, as a condition of according national treatment under this Article, require right holders to comply with any formalities or conditions in order to acquire rights in respect of copyright and related rights. 3. A Party may derogate from paragraph 1 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures for the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights, including any procedure requiring a national of another Party to designate for service of process an address in the Party's territory or to appoint an agent in the Party's territory, if the derogation is consistent with the relevant Convention listed in Article 1701(2), provided that such derogation: (a) is necessary to secure compliance with measures that are not inconsistent with this Chapter; and (b) is not applied in a manner that would constitute a disguised restriction on trade. 4. No Party shall have any obligation under this Article with respect to procedures provided in multilateral agreements concluded under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization relating to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights. ARTICLE 1704: Control of Abusive or Anticompetitive Practices or Conditions Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from specifying in its domestic law licensing practices or conditions that may in particular cases constitute an abuse of intellectual property rights having an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market. A Party may adopt or maintain, consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement, appropriate measures to prevent or control such practices or conditions. ARTICLE 1705: Copyright 1. Each Party shall protect the works covered by Article 2 of the Berne Convention, including any other works that embody original expression within the meaning of that Convention. In particular: (a) all types of computer programs are literary works within the meaning of the Berne Convention and each Party shall protect them as such; and (b) compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations, shall be protected as such. The protection a Party provides under subparagraph (b) shall not extend to the data or material itself, or prejudice any copyright subsisting in that data or material. 2. Each Party shall provide to authors and their successors in interest those rights enumerated in the Berne Convention in respect of works covered by paragraph 1, including the right to authorize or prohibit: (a) the importation into the Party's territory of copies of the work made without the right holder's authorization; (b) the first public distribution of the original and each copy of the work by sale, rental or otherwise; (c) the communication of a work to the public; and (d) the commercial rental of the original or a copy of a computer program. Subparagraph (d) shall not apply where the copy of the computer program is not itself an essential object of the rental. Each Party shall provide that putting the original or a copy of a computer program on the market with the right holder's consent shall not exhaust the rental right. 3. Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights: (a) any person acquiring or holding economic rights may freely and separately transfer such rights by contract for purposes of their exploitation and enjoyment by the transferee; and (b) any person acquiring or holding such economic rights by virtue of a contract, including contracts of employment underlying the creation of works and sound recordings, shall be able to exercise those rights in its own name and enjoy fully the benefits derived from those rights. 4. 5. Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work, other than a photographic work or a work of applied art, is to be calculated on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than 50 years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorized publication of the work or, failing such authorized publication within 50 years from the making of the work, 50 years from the end of the calendar year of making. 5. Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the rights provided for in this Article to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. 6. No Party may grant translation and reproduction licenses permitted under the Appendix to the Berne Convention where legitimate needs in that Party's territory for copies or translations of the work could be met by the right holder's voluntary actions but for obstacles created by the Party's measures. 7. Annex 1705.7 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex. Article 1706: Sound Recordings 1. Each Party shall provide to the producer of a sound recording the right to authorize or prohibit: (a) the direct or indirect reproduction of the sound recording; (b) the importation into the Party's territory of copies of the sound recording made without the producer's authorization; (c) the first public distribution of the original and each copy of the sound recording by sale, rental or otherwise; and (d) the commercial rental of the original or a copy of the sound recording, except where expressly otherwise provided in a contract between the producer of the sound recording and the authors of the works fixed therein. Each Party shall provide that putting the original or a copy of a sound recording on the market with the right holder's consent shall not exhaust the rental right. 2. Each Party shall provide a term of protection for sound recordings of at least 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made. 3. Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the rights provided for in this Article to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the sound recording and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. ARTICLE 1707: Protection of Encrypted ProgramCarrying Satellite Signals Within one year from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, each Party shall make it: (a) a criminal offense to manufacture, import, sell, lease or otherwise make available a device or system that is primarily of assistance in decoding an encrypted program carrying satellite signal without the authorization of the lawful distributor of such signal; and (b) a civil offense to receive, in connection with commercial activities, or further distribute, an encrypted program carrying satellite signal that has been decoded without the authorization of the lawful distributor of the signal or to engage in any activity prohibited under subparagraph (a). Each Party shall provide that any civil offense established under subparagraph (b) shall be actionable by any person that holds an interest in the content of such signal. ARTICLE 1708: Trademarks 1. For purposes of this Agreement, a trademark consists of any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of another, including personal names, designs, letters, numerals, colors, figurative elements, or the shape of goods or of their packaging. Trademarks shall include service marks and collective marks, and may include certification marks. A Party may require, as a condition for registration, that a sign be visually perceptible. 2. Each Party shall provide to the owner of a registered trademark the right to prevent all persons not having the owner's consent from using in commerce identical or similar signs for goods or services that are identical or similar to those goods or services in respect of which the owner's trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In the case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. The rights described above shall not prejudice any prior rights, nor shall they affect the possibility of a Party making rights available on the basis of use. 3. A Party may make registrability depend on use. However, actual use of a trademark shall not be a condition for filing an application for registration. No Party may refuse an application solely on the ground that intended use has not taken place before the expiry of a period of three years from the date of application for registration. 4. Each Party shall provide a system for the registration of trademarks, which shall include: (a) examination of applications; (b) notice to be given to an applicant of the reasons for the refusal to register a trademark; (c) a reasonable opportunity for the applicant to respond to the notice; (d) publication of each trademark either before or promptly after it is registered; and (e) a reasonable opportunity for interested persons to petition to cancel the registration of a trademark. A Party may provide for a reasonable opportunity for interested persons to oppose the registration of a trademark. 5. The nature of the goods or services to which a trademark is to be applied shall in no case form an obstacle to the registration of the trademark. 6. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, with such modifications as may be necessary, to services. In determining whether a trademark is wellknown, account shall be taken of the knowledge of the trademark in the relevant sector of the public, including knowledge in the Party's territory obtained as a result of the promotion of the trademark. No Party may require that the reputation of the trademark extend beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the relevant goods or services. 7. Each Party shall provide that the initial registration of a trademark be for a term of at least 10 years and that the registration be indefinitely renewable for terms of not less than 10 years when conditions for renewal have been met. 8. Each Party shall require the use of a trademark to maintain a registration. The registration may be canceled for the reason of non-use only after an uninterrupted period of at least two years of non-use, unless valid reasons based on the existence of obstacles to such use are shown by the trademark owner. Each Party shall recognize, as valid reasons for non- use, circumstances arising independently of the will of the trademark owner that constitute an obstacle to the use of the trademark, such as import restrictions on, or other government requirements for, goods or services identified by the trademark. 9. Each Party shall recognize use of a trademark by a person other than the trademark owner, where such use is subject to the owner's control, as use of the trademark for purposes of maintaining the registration. 10. No Party may encumber the use of a trademark in commerce by special requirements, such as a use that reduces the trademark's function as an indication of source or a use with another trademark. 11. A Party may determine conditions on the licensing and assignment of trademarks, it being understood that the compulsory licensing of trademarks shall not be permitted and that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the right to assign its trademark with or without the transfer of the business to which the trademark belongs. 12. A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take into account the legitimate interests of the trademark owner and of other persons. 13. Each Party shall prohibit the registration as a trademark of words, at least in English, French or Spanish, that generically designate goods or services or types of goods or services to which the trademark applies. 14. Each Party shall refuse to register trademarks that consist of or comprise immoral, deceptive or scandalous matter, or matter that may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs or any Party's national symbols, or bring them into contempt or disrepute. ARTICLE 1709: Patents 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, each Party shall make patents available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that such inventions are new, result from an inventive step and are capable of industrial application. For purposes of this Article, a Party may deem the terms "inventive step" and "capable of industrial application" to be synonymous with the terms "non-obvious" and "useful", respectively. 2. A Party may exclude from patentability inventions if preventing in its territory the commercial exploitation of the inventions is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided that the exclusion is not based solely on the ground that the Party prohibits commercial exploitation in its territory of the subject matter of the patent. 3. A Party may also exclude from patentability: (a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals; (b) plants and animals other than microorganisms; and (c) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals, other than non-biological and microbiological processes for such production. Notwithstanding subparagraph (b), each Party shall provide for the protection of plant varieties through patents, an effective scheme of sui generis protection, or both. 4. If a Party has not made available product patent protection for pharmaceutical or agricultural chemicals commensurate with paragraph 1: (a) as of January 1, 1992, for subject matter that relates to naturally occurring substances prepared or produced by, or significantly derived from, microbiological processes and intended for food or medicine, and (b) as of July 1, 1991, for any other subject matter, that Party shall provide to the inventor of any such product or its assignee the means to obtain product patent protection for such product for the unexpired term of the patent for such product granted in another Party, as long as the product has not been marketed in the Party providing protection under this paragraph and the person seeking such protection makes a timely request. 5. Each Party shall provide that: (a) where the subject matter of a patent is a product, the patent shall confer on the patent owner the right to prevent other persons from making, using or selling the subject matter of the patent, without the patent owner's consent; and (b) where the subject matter of a patent is a process, the patent shall confer on the patent owner the right to prevent other persons from using that process and from using, selling, or importing at least the product obtained directly by that process, without the patent owner's consent. 6. 7. A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking into account the legitimate interests of other persons. 7. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of technology, the territory of the Party where the invention was made and whether products are imported or locally produced. 8. A Party may revoke a patent only when: (a) grounds exist that would have justified a refusal to grant the patent; or (b) the grant of a compulsory license has not remedied the lack of exploitation of the patent. 9. 10. Each Party shall permit patent owners to assign and transfer by succession their patents, and to conclude licensing contracts. 10. Where the law of a Party allows for use of the subject matter of a patent, other than that use allowed under paragraph 6, without the authorization of the right holder, including use by the government or other persons authorized by the government, the Party shall respect the following provisions: (a) authorization of such use shall be considered on its individual merits; (b) such use may only be permitted if, prior to such use, the proposed user has made efforts to obtain authorization from the right holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions and such efforts have not been successful within a reasonable period of time. The requirement to make such efforts may be waived by a Party in the case of a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. In situations of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, the right holder shall, nevertheless, be notified as soon as reasonably practicable. In the case of public non-commercial use, where the government or contractor, without making a patent search, knows or has demonstrable grounds to know that a valid patent is or will be used by or for the government, the right holder shall be informed promptly; (c) the scope and duration of such use shall be limited to the purpose for which it was authorized; (d) such use shall be non-exclusive; (e) such use shall be non-assignable, except with that part of the enterprise or goodwill that enjoys such use; (f) any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the Party's domestic market; (g) authorization for such use shall be liable, subject to adequate protection of the legitimate interests of the persons so authorized, to be terminated if and when the circumstances that led to it cease to exist and are unlikely to recur. The competent authority shall have the authority to review, on motivated request, the continued existence of these circumstances; (h) the right holder shall be paid adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case, taking into account the economic value of the authorization; (i) the legal validity of any decision relating to the authorization shall be subject to judicial or other independent review by a distinct higher authority; (j) any decision relating to the remuneration provided in respect of such use shall be subject to judicial or other independent review by a distinct higher authority; (k) the Party shall not be obliged to apply the conditions set out in subparagraphs (b) and (f) where such use is permitted to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anticompetitive. The need to correct anticompetitive practices may be taken into account in determining the amount of remuneration in such cases. Competent authorities shall have the authority to refuse termination of authorization if and when the conditions that led to such authorization are likely to recur; (l) the Party shall not authorize the use of the subject matter of a patent to permit the exploitation of another patent except as a remedy for an adjudicated violation of domestic laws regarding anticompetitive practices. 11. Where the subject matter of a patent is a process for obtaining a product, each Party shall, in any infringement proceeding, place on the defendant the burden of establishing that the allegedly infringing product was made by a process other than the patented process in one of the following situations: (a) the product obtained by the patented process is new; or (b) a substantial likelihood exists that the allegedly infringing product was made by the process and the patent owner has been unable through reasonable efforts to determine the process actually used. In the gathering and evaluation of evidence, the legitimate interests of the defendant in protecting its trade secrets shall be taken into account. 12. Each Party shall provide a term of protection for patents of at least 20 years from the date of filing or 17 years from the date of grant. A Party may extend the term of patent protection, in appropriate cases, to compensate for delays caused by regulatory approval processes.

Each Party shall protect layout designs (topographies) of integrated circuits ("layout designs") in accordance with Articles 2 through 7, 12 and 16(3), other than Article 6(3), of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits as opened for signature on May 26, 1989. 2. Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall make it unlawful for any person without the right holder's authorization to import, sell or otherwise distribute for commercial purposes any of the following: (a) a protected layout design; (b) an integrated circuit in which a protected layout design is incorporated; or (c) an article incorporating such an integrated circuit, only insofar as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout design. 3. No Party may make unlawful any of the acts referred to in paragraph 2 performed in respect of an integrated circuit that incorporates an unlawfully reproduced layout design, or any article that incorporates such an integrated circuit, where the person performing those acts or ordering those acts to be done did not know and had no reasonable ground to know, when it acquired the integrated circuit or article incorporating such an integrated circuit, that it incorporated an unlawfully reproduced layout design. 4. Each Party shall provide that, after the person referred to in paragraph 3 has received sufficient notice that the layout design was unlawfully reproduced, such person may perform any of the acts with respect to the stock on hand or ordered before such notice, but shall be liable to pay the right holder for doing so an amount equivalent to a reasonable royalty such as would be payable under a freely negotiated license in respect of such a layout design. 5. No Party may permit the compulsory licensing of layout designs of integrated circuits. 6. Any Party that requires registration as a condition for protection of a layout design shall provide that the term of protection shall not end before the expiration of a period of 10 years counted from the date of: (a) filing of the application for registration; or (b) the first commercial exploitation of the layout design, wherever in the world it occurs. 7. Where a Party does not require registration as a condition for protection of a layout design, the Party shall provide a term of protection of not less than 10 years from the date of the first commercial exploitation of the layout design, wherever in the world it occurs. 8. Notwithstanding paragraphs 6 and 7, a Party may provide that the protection shall lapse 15 years after the creation of the layout design. 9. Annex 1710.9 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex. ARTICLE 1711: Trade Secrets 1. Each Party shall provide the legal means for any person to prevent trade secrets from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others without the consent of the person lawfully in control of the information in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices, in so far as: (a) the information is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons that normally deal with the kind of information in question; (b) the information has actual or potential commercial value because it is secret; and (c) the person lawfully in control of the information has taken reasonable steps under the circumstances to keep it secret. 2. A Party may require that to qualify for protection a trade secret must be evidenced in documents, electronic or magnetic means, optical discs, microfilms, films or other similar instruments. 3. No Party may limit the duration of protection for trade secrets, so long as the conditions in paragraph 1 exist. 4. No Party may discourage or impede the voluntary licensing of trade secrets by imposing excessive or discriminatory conditions on such licenses or conditions that dilute the value of the trade secrets. 5. If a Party requires, as a condition for approving the marketing of pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical products that utilize new chemical entities, the submission of undisclosed test or other data necessary to determine whether the use of such products is safe and effective, the Party shall protect against disclosure of the data of persons making such submissions, where the origination of such data involves considerable effort, except where the disclosure is necessary to protect the public or unless steps are taken to ensure that the data is protected against unfair commercial use. 6. Each Party shall provide that for data subject to paragraph 5 that are submitted to the Party after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, no person other than the person that submitted them may, without the latter's permission, rely on such data in support of an application for product approval during a reasonable period of time after their submission. For this purpose, a reasonable period shall normally mean not less than five years from the date on which the Party granted approval to the person that produced the data for approval to market its product, taking account of the nature of the data and the person's efforts and expenditures in producing them. Subject to this provision, there shall be no limitation on any Party to implement abbreviated approval procedures for such products on the basis of bioequivalence and bioavailability studies. 7. Where a Party relies on a marketing approval granted by another Party, the reasonable period of exclusive use of the data submitted in connection with obtaining the approval relied on shall begin with the date of the first marketing approval relied on. ARTICLE 1712: Geographical Indications 1. Each Party shall provide, in respect of geographical indications, the legal means for interested persons to prevent: (a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a territory, region or locality other than the true place of origin, in a manner that misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good; (b) any use that constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of Article 10bis of the Paris Convention. 2. Each Party shall, on its own initiative if its domestic law so permits or at the request of an interested person, refuse to register, or invalidate the registration of, a trademark containing or consisting of a geographical indication with respect to goods that do not originate in the indicated territory, region or locality, if use of the indication in the trademark for such goods is of such a nature as to mislead the public as to the geographical origin of the good. 3. Each Party shall also apply paragraphs 1 and 2 to a geographical indication that, although correctly indicating the territory, region or locality in which the goods originate, falsely represents to the public that the goods originate in another territory, region or locality. 4. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require a Party to prevent continued and similar use of a particular geographical indication of another Party in connection with goods or services by any of its nationals or domiciliaries who have used that geographical indication in a continuous manner with regard to the same or related goods or services in that Party's territory, either: (a) for at least 10 years, or (b) in good faith, before the date of signature of this Agreement. 5. Where a trademark has been applied for or registered in good faith, or where rights to a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith, either: (a) before the date of application of these provisions in that Party, or (b) before the geographical indication is protected in its Party of origin, no Party may adopt any measure to implement this Article that prejudices eligibility for, or the validity of, the registration of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, on the basis that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, a geographical indication. 6. No Party shall be required to apply this Article to a geographical indication if it is identical to the customary term in common language in that Party's territory for the goods or services to which the indication applies. 7. A Party may provide that any request made under this Article in connection with the use or registration of a trademark must be presented within five years after the adverse use of the protected indication has become generally known in that Party or after the date of registration of the trademark in that Party, provided that the trademark has been published by that date, if such date is earlier than the date on which the adverse use became generally known in that Party, provided that the geographical indication is not used or registered in bad faith. 8. No Party shall adopt any measure implementing this Article that would prejudice any person's right to use, in the course of trade, its name or the name of its predecessor in business, except where such name forms all or part of a valid trademark in existence before the geographical indication became protected and with which there is a likelihood of confusion, or such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public. 9. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to protect a geographical indication that is not protected, or has fallen into disuse, in the Party of origin. ARTICLE 1713: Industrial Designs 1. Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently created industrial designs that are new or original. A Party may provide that: (a) designs are not new or original if they do not significantly differ from known designs or combinations of known design features; and (b) such protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations. 2. Each Party shall ensure that the requirements for securing protection for textile designs, in particular in regard to any cost, examination or publication, do not unreasonably impair a person's opportunity to seek and obtain such protection. A Party may comply with this obligation through industrial design law or copyright law. 3. Each Party shall provide the owner of a protected industrial design the right to prevent other persons not having the owner's consent from making or selling articles bearing or embodying a design that is a copy, or substantially a copy, of the protected design, when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes. 4. A Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of industrial designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected industrial designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking into account the legitimate interests of other persons. 5. Each Party shall provide a term of protection for industrial designs of at least 10 years. ARTICLE 1714: Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights: General Provisions 1. Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures, as specified in this Article and Articles 1715 through 1718, are available under its domestic law so as to permit effective action to be taken against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies to deter further infringements. Such enforcement procedures shall be applied so as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against abuse of the procedures. 2. Each Party shall ensure that its procedures for the enforcement of intellectual property rights are fair and equitable, are not unnecessarily complicated or costly, and do not entail unreasonable timelimits or unwarranted delays. 3. Each Party shall provide that decisions on the merits of a case in judicial and administrative enforcement proceedings shall: (a) preferably be in writing and preferably state the reasons on which the decisions are based; (b) be made available at least to the parties in a proceeding without undue delay; and (c) be based only on evidence in respect of which such parties were offered the opportunity to be heard. 4. Each Party shall ensure that parties in a proceeding have an opportunity to have final administrative decisions reviewed by a judicial authority of that Party and, subject to jurisdictional provisions in its domestic laws concerning the importance of a case, to have reviewed at least the legal aspects of initial judicial decisions on the merits of a case. Notwithstanding the above, no Party shall be required to provide for judicial review of acquittals in criminal cases. 5. Nothing in this Article or Articles 1715 through 1718 shall be construed to require a Party to establish a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that Party's system for the enforcement of laws in general. 6. For the purposes of Articles 1715 through 1718, the term "right holder" includes federations and associations having legal standing to assert such rights. Article 1715: Specific Procedural and Remedial Aspects of Civil and Administrative Procedures 1. Each Party shall make available to right holders civil judicial procedures for the enforcement of any intellectual property right provided in this Chapter. Each Party shall provide that: (a) defendants have the right to written notice that is timely and contains sufficient detail, including the basis of the claims; (b) parties in a proceeding are allowed to be represented by independent legal counsel; (c) the procedures do not include imposition of overly burdensome requirements concerning mandatory personal appearances; (d) all parties in a proceeding are duly entitled to substantiate their claims and to present relevant evidence; and (e) the procedures include a means to identify and protect confidential information. 2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority: (a) where a party in a proceeding has presented reasonably available evidence sufficient to support its claims and has specified evidence relevant to the substantiation of its claims that is within the control of the opposing party, to order the opposing party to produce such evidence, subject in appropriate cases to conditions that ensure the protection of confidential information; (b) where a party in a proceeding voluntarily and without good reason refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide relevant evidence under that party's control within a reasonable period, or significantly impedes a proceeding relating to an enforcement action, to make preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative, on the basis of the evidence presented, including the complaint or the allegation presented by the party adversely affected by the denial of access to evidence, subject to providing the parties an opportunity to be heard on the allegations or evidence; (c) to order a party in a proceeding to desist from an infringement, including to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right, which order shall be enforceable at least immediately after customs clearance of such goods; (d) to order the infringer of an intellectual property right to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of the infringement where the infringer knew or had reasonable grounds to know that it was engaged in an infringing activity; (e) to order an infringer of an intellectual property right to pay the right holder's expenses, which may include appropriate attorney's fees; and (f) to order a party in a proceeding at whose request measures were taken and who has abused enforcement procedures to provide adequate compensation to any party wrongfully enjoined or restrained in the proceeding for the injury suffered because of such abuse and to pay that party's expenses, which may include appropriate attorney's fees. 3. 4. With respect to the authority referred to in subparagraph 2(c), no Party shall be obliged to provide such authority in respect of protected subject matter that is acquired or ordered by a person before that person knew or had reasonable grounds to know that dealing in that subject matter would entail the infringement of an intellectual property right. 4. With respect to the authority referred to in subparagraph 2(d), a Party may, at least with respect to copyrighted works and sound recordings, authorize the judicial authorities to order recovery of profits or payment of pre-established damages, or both, even where the infringer did not know or had no reasonable grounds to know that it was engaged in an infringing activity. 5. Each Party shall provide that, in order to create an effective deterrent to infringement, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that: (a) goods that they have found to be infringing be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any injury caused to the right holder or, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements, destroyed; and (b) materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the creation of the infringing goods be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements. In considering whether to issue such an order, judicial authorities shall take into account the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the interests of other persons. In regard to counterfeit goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit release of the goods into the channels of commerce. 6. In respect of the administration of any law pertaining to the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall only exempt both public authorities and officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where actions are taken or intended in good faith in the course of the administration of such laws. 7. Notwithstanding the other provisions of Articles 1714 through 1718, where a Party is sued with respect to an infringement of an intellectual property right as a result of its use of that right or use on its behalf, that Party may limit the remedies available against it to the payment to the right holder of adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case, taking into account the economic value of the use. 8. Each Party shall provide that, where a civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Article. ARTICLE 1716: Provisional Measures 1. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order prompt and effective provisional measures: (a) to prevent an infringement of any intellectual property right, and in particular to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of allegedly infringing goods, including measures to prevent the entry of imported goods at least immediately after customs clearance; and (b) to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the alleged infringement. 2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to require any applicant for provisional measures to provide to the judicial authorities any evidence reasonably available to that applicant that the judicial authorities consider necessary to enable them to determine with a sufficient degree of certainty whether: (a) the applicant is the right holder; (b) the applicant's right is being infringed or such infringement is imminent; and (c) any delay in the issuance of such measures is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holder, or there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to require the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the interests of the defendant and to prevent abuse. 3. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to require an applicant for provisional measures to provide other information necessary for the identification of the relevant goods by the authority that will execute the provisional measures. 4. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order provisional measures on an ex parte basis, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holder, or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed. 5. Each Party shall provide that where provisional measures are adopted by that Party's judicial authorities on an ex parte basis: (a) a person affected shall be given notice of those measures without delay but in any event no later than immediately after the execution of the measures; (b) a defendant shall, on request, have those measures reviewed by that Party's judicial authorities for the purpose of deciding, within a reasonable period after notice of those measures is given, whether the measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed, and shall be given an opportunity to be heard in the review proceedings. 6. Without prejudice to paragraph 5, each Party shall provide that, on the request of the defendant, the Party's judicial authorities shall revoke or otherwise cease to apply the provisional measures taken on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 4 if proceedings leading to a decision on the merits are not initiated: (a) within a reasonable period as determined by the judicial authority ordering the measures where the Party's domestic law so permits; or (b) in the absence of such a determination, within a period of no more than 20 working days or 31 calendar days, whichever is longer. 7. Each Party shall provide that, where the provisional measures are revoked or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where the judicial authorities subsequently find that there has been no infringement or threat of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, on request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by these measures. 8. Each Party shall provide that, where a provisional measure can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Article. ARTICLE 1717: Criminal Procedures and Penalties 1. Each Party shall provide criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. Each Party shall provide that penalties available include imprisonment or monetary fines, or both, sufficient to provide a deterrent, consistent with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a corresponding gravity. 2. Each Party shall provide that, in appropriate cases, its judicial authorities may order the seizure, forfeiture and destruction of infringing goods and of any materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the commission of the offense. 3. A Party may provide criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in cases of infringement of intellectual property rights, other than those in paragraph 1, where they are committed wilfully and on a commercial scale. ARTICLE 1718: Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights at the Border 1. Each Party shall, in conformity with this Article, adopt procedures to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for suspecting that the importation of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods may take place, to lodge an application in writing with its competent authorities, whether administrative or judicial, for the suspension by the customs administration of the release of such goods into free circulation. No Party shall be obligated to apply such procedures to goods in transit. A Party may permit such an application to be made in respect of goods that involve other infringements of intellectual property rights, provided that the requirements of this Article are met. A Party may also provide for corresponding procedures concerning the suspension by the customs administration of the release of infringing goods destined for exportation from its territory. 2. Each Party shall require any applicant who initiates procedures under paragraph 1 to provide adequate evidence: (a) to satisfy that Party's competent authorities that, under the domestic laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of its intellectual property right; and (b) to supply a sufficiently detailed description of the goods to make them readily recognizable by the customs administration. The competent authorities shall inform the applicant within a reasonable period whether they have accepted the application and, if so, the period for which the customs administration will take action. 3. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require an applicant under paragraph 1 to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. 4. Each Party shall provide that, where pursuant to an application under procedures adopted pursuant to this Article, its customs administration suspends the release of goods involving industrial designs, patents, integrated circuits or trade secrets into free circulation on the basis of a decision other than by a judicial or other independent authority, and the period provided for in paragraphs 6 through 8 has expired without the granting of provisional relief by the duly empowered authority, and provided that all other conditions for importation have been complied with, the owner, importer or consignee of such goods shall be entitled to their release on the posting of a security in an amount sufficient to protect the right holder against any infringement. Payment of such security shall not prejudice any other remedy available to the right holder, it being understood that the security shall be released if the right holder fails to pursue its right of action within a reasonable period of time. 5. Each Party shall provide that its customs administration shall promptly notify the importer and the applicant when the customs administration suspends the release of goods pursuant to paragraph 1. 6. Each Party shall provide that its customs administration shall release goods from suspension if within a period not exceeding 10 working days after the applicant under paragraph 1 has been served notice of the suspension the customs administration has not been informed that: (a) a party other than the defendant has initiated proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case, or (b) a competent authority has taken provisional measures prolonging the suspension, provided that all other conditions for importation or exportation have been met. Each Party shall provide that, in appropriate cases, the customs administration may extend the suspension by another 10 working days. 7. Each Party shall provide that if proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case have been initiated, a review, including a right to be heard, shall take place on request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period, whether these measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed. 8. Notwithstanding paragraphs 6 and 7, where the suspension of the release of goods is carried out or continued in accordance with a provisional judicial measure, Article 1716(6) shall apply. 9. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant under paragraph 1 to pay the importer, the consignee and the owner of the goods appropriate compensation for any injury caused to them through the wrongful detention of goods or through the detention of goods released pursuant to paragraph 6. 10. Without prejudice to the protection of confidential information, each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to give the right holder sufficient opportunity to have any goods detained by the customs administration inspected in order to substantiate the right holder's claims. Each Party shall also provide that its competent authorities have the authority to give the importer an equivalent opportunity to have any such goods inspected. Where the competent authorities have made a positive determination on the merits of a case, a Party may provide the competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 11. Where a Party requires its competent authorities to act on their own initiative and to suspend the release of goods in respect of which they have acquired prima facie evidence that an intellectual property right is being infringed: (a) the competent authorities may at any time seek from the right holder any information that may assist them to exercise these powers; (b) the importer and the right holder shall be promptly notified of the suspension by the Party's competent authorities, and where the importer lodges an appeal against the suspension with competent authorities, the suspension shall be subject to the conditions, with such modifications as may be necessary, set out in paragraphs 6 through 8; and (c) the Party shall only exempt both public authorities and officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where actions are taken or intended in good faith. 12. Without prejudice to other rights of action open to the right holder and subject to the defendant's right to seek judicial review, each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to order the destruction or disposal of infringing goods in accordance with the principles set out in Article 1715(5). In regard to counterfeit goods, the authorities shall not allow the re exportation of the infringing goods in an unaltered state or subject them to a different customs procedure, other than in exceptional circumstances. 13. A Party may exclude from the application of paragraphs 1 through 12 small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers' personal luggage or sent in small consignments that are not repetitive. 14. Annex 1718.14 applies to the Parties specified in that Annex. ARTICLE 1719: Cooperation and Technical Assistance 1. The Parties shall provide each other on mutually agreed terms with technical assistance and shall promote cooperation between their competent authorities. Such cooperation shall include the training of personnel. 2. The Parties shall cooperate with a view to eliminating trade in goods that infringe intellectual property rights. For this purpose, each Party shall establish and notify the other Parties by January 1, 1994 of contact points in its federal government and shall exchange information concerning trade in infringing goods. ARTICLE 1720: Protection of Existing Subject Matter 1. Except as required under Article 1705(7), this Agreement does not give rise to obligations in respect of acts that occurred before the date of application of the relevant provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question. 2. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, each Party shall apply this Agreement to all subject matter existing on the date of application of the relevant provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question and that is protected in a Party on such date, or that meets or subsequently meets the criteria for protection under the terms of this Chapter. In respect of this paragraph and paragraphs 3 and 4, a Party's obligations with respect to existing works shall be solely determined under Article 18 of the Berne Convention and with respect to the rights of producers of sound recordings in existing sound recordings shall be determined solely under Article 18 of that Convention, as made applicable under this Agreement. 3. Except as required under Article 1705(7), and notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph 2, no Party may be required to restore protection to subject matter that, on the date of application of the relevant provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question, has fallen into the public domain in its territory. 4. In respect of any acts relating to specific objects embodying protected subject matter that become infringing under the terms of laws in conformity with this Agreement, and that were begun or in respect of which a significant investment was made, before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, any Party may provide for a limitation of the remedies available to the right holder as to the continued performance of such acts after the date of application of this Agreement for that Party. In such cases, the Party shall, however, at least provide for payment of equitable remuneration. 5. No Party shall be obliged to apply Article 1705(2)(d) or 1706(1)(d) with respect to originals or copies purchased prior to the date of application of the relevant provisions of this Agreement for that Party. 6. No Party shall be required to apply Article 1709(10), or the requirement in Article 1709(7) that patent rights shall be enjoyable without discrimination as to the field of technology, to use without the authorization of the right holder where authorization for such use was granted by the government before the text of the Draft Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations became known. 7. In the case of intellectual property rights for which protection is conditional on registration, applications for protection that are pending on the date of application of the relevant provisions of this Agreement for the Party in question shall be permitted to be amended to claim any enhanced protection provided under this Agreement. Such amendments shall not include new matter. ARTICLE 1721: Definitions 1.

On request of another Party, a Party shall promptly provide information and respond to questions pertaining to any actual or proposed measure, whether or not that other Party has been previously notified of that measure. 3. Any notification or information provided under this Article shall be without prejudice as to whether the measure is consistent with this Agreement. ARTICLE 1804: Administrative Proceedings With a view to administering in a consistent, impartial and reasonable manner all measures of general application affecting matters covered by this Agreement, each Party shall ensure that in its administrative proceedings applying measures referred to in Article 1802 to particular persons, goods or services of another Party in specific cases that: (a) wherever possible, persons of another Party that are directly affected by a proceeding are provided reasonable notice, in accordance with domestic procedures, when a proceeding is initiated, including a description of the nature of the proceeding, a statement of the legal authority under which the proceeding is initiated and a general description of any issues in controversy; (b) such persons are afforded a reasonable opportunity to present facts and arguments in support of their positions prior to any final administrative action, when time, the nature of the proceeding and the public interest permit; and (c) its procedures are in accordance with domestic law. ARTICLE 1805: Review and Appeal 1. Each Party shall establish or maintain judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative tribunals or procedures for the purpose of the prompt review and, where warranted, correction of final administrative actions regarding matters covered by this Agreement. Such tribunals shall be impartial and independent of the office or authority entrusted with administrative enforcement and shall not have any substantial interest in the outcome of the matter. 2. Each Party shall ensure that, in any such tribunals or procedures, the parties to the proceeding are provided with the right to: (a) a reasonable opportunity to support or defend their respective positions; and (b) a decision based on the evidence and submissions of record or, where required by domestic law, the record compiled by the administrative authority. 3. Each Party shall ensure, subject to appeal or further review as provided in its domestic law, that such decisions shall be implemented by, and shall govern the practice of, the offices or authorities with respect to the administrative action at issue. ARTICLE 1806: Definitions For purposes of this Chapter: administrative ruling of general application means an administrative ruling or interpretation that applies to all persons and fact situations that fall generally within its ambit and that establishes a norm of conduct but does not include: (a) a determination or ruling made in an administrative or quasi-judicial proceeding that applies to a particular person, good or service of another Party in a specific case; or (b) a ruling that adjudicates with respect to a particular act or practice. CHAPTER NINETEEN: REVIEW AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT IN ANTIDUMPING AND COUNTERVAILING DUTY MATTERS ARTICLE 1901: General Provisions 1. Article 1904 applies only with respect to goods that the competent investigating authority of the importing Party, applying the importing Party's antidumping or countervailing duty law to the facts of a specific case, determines are goods of another Party. 2. For purposes of Articles 1903 and 1904, panels shall be established in accordance with the provisions of Annex 1901.2. 3. Except for Article 2203 (Entry into Force), no provision of any other Chapter of this Agreement shall be construed as imposing obligations on a Party with respect to the Party's antidumping law or countervailing duty law. Article 1902: Retention of Domestic Antidumping Law and Countervailing Duty Law 1. Each Party reserves the right to apply its antidumping law and countervailing duty law to goods imported from the territory of any other Party. Antidumping law and countervailing duty law include, as appropriate for each Party, relevant statutes, legislative history, regulations, administrative practice and judicial precedents. 2. Each Party reserves the right to change or modify its antidumping law or countervailing duty law, provided that in the case of an amendment to a Party's antidumping or countervailing duty statute: (a) such amendment shall apply to goods from another Party only if the amending statute specifies that it applies to goods from that Party or from the Parties to this Agreement; (b) the amending Party notifies in writing the Parties to which the amendment applies of the amending statute as far in advance as possible of the date of enactment of such statute; (c) following notification, the amending Party, on request of any Party to which the amendment applies, consults with that Party prior to the enactment of the amending statute; and Page 352 (d) such amendment, as applicable to that other Party, is not inconsistent with (i) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the Antidumping Code) or the Agreement on the Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the Subsidies Code), or any successor agreement to which all the original signatories to this Agreement are party, or (ii) the object and purpose of this Agreement and this Chapter, which is to establish fair and predictable conditions for the progressive liberalization of trade between the Parties to this Agreement while maintaining effective and fair disciplines on unfair trade practices, such object and purpose to be ascertained from the provisions of this Agreement, its preamble and objectives, and the practices of the Parties. ARTICLE 1903: Review of Statutory Amendments 1. A Party to which an amendment of another Party's antidumping or countervailing duty statute applies may request in writing that such amendment be referred to a binational panel for a declaratory opinion as to whether: (a) the amendment does not conform to the provisions of Article 1902(2)(d)(i) or (ii); or (b) such amendment has the function and effect of overturning a prior decision of a panel made pursuant to Article 1904 and does not conform to the provisions of Article 1902(2)(d)(i) or (ii). Such declaratory opinion shall have force or effect only as provided in this Article. 2. The panel shall conduct its review in accordance with the procedures of Annex 1903.2. 3. In the event that the panel recommends modifications to the amending statute to remedy a non-conformity that it has identified in its opinion: (a) the two Parties shall immediately begin consultations and shall seek to achieve a mutually satisfactory solution to the matter within 90 days of the issuance of the panel's final declaratory opinion. Such solution may include seeking corrective legislation with respect to the statute of the amending Party; (b) if corrective legislation is not enacted within nine months from the end of the 90day consultation period referred to in subparagraph (a) and no other mutually satisfactory solution has been reached, the Party that requested the panel may (i) take comparable legislative or equivalent executive action, or (ii) terminate this Agreement with regard to the amending Party on 60 day written notice to that Party. ARTICLE 1904: Review of Final Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Determinations 1. As provided in this Article, each Party shall replace judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations with binational panel review. 2. An involved Party may request that a panel review, based on the administrative record, a final antidumping or countervailing duty determination of a competent investigating authority of an importing Party to determine whether such determination was in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing Party. For this purpose, the antidumping or countervailing duty law consists of the relevant statutes, legislative history, regulations, administrative practice and judicial precedents to the extent that a court of the importing Party would rely on such materials in reviewing a final determination of the competent investigating authority. Solely for purposes of the panel review provided for in this Article, the antidumping and countervailing duty statutes of the Parties, as those statutes may be amended from time to time, are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. 3. The panel shall apply the standard of review set out in Annex 1911 and the general legal principles that a court of the importing Party otherwise would apply to a review of a determination of the competent investigating authority. 4. A request for a panel shall be made in writing to the other involved Party within 30 days following the date of publication of the final determination in question in the official journal of the importing Party. In the case of final determinations that are not published in the official journal of the importing Party, the importing Party shall immediately notify the other involved Party of such final determination where it involves goods from the other involved Party, and the other involved Party may request a panel within 30 days of receipt of such notice. Where the competent investigating authority of the importing Party has imposed provisional measures in an investigation, the other involved Party may provide notice of its intention to request a panel under this Article, and the Parties shall begin to establish a panel at that time. Failure to request a panel within the time specified in this paragraph shall preclude review by a panel. 5. An involved Party on its own initiative may request review of a final determination by a panel and shall, on request of a person who would otherwise be entitled under the law of the importing Party to commence domestic procedures for judicial review of that final determination, request such review. 6. The panel shall conduct its review in accordance with the procedures established by the Parties pursuant to paragraph 14. Where both involved Parties request a panel to review a final determination, a single panel shall review that determination. 7. The competent investigating authority that issued the final determination in question shall have the right to appear and be represented by counsel before the panel. Each Party shall provide that other persons who, pursuant to the law of the importing Party, otherwise would have had the right to appear and be represented in a domestic judicial review proceeding concerning the determination of the competent investigating authority, shall have the right to appear and be represented by counsel before the panel. 8. The panel may uphold a final determination, or remand it for action not inconsistent with the panel's decision. Where the panel remands a final determination, the panel shall establish as brief a time as is reasonable for compliance with the remand, taking into account the complexity of the factual and legal issues involved and the nature of the panel's decision. In no event shall the time permitted for compliance with a remand exceed an amount of time equal to the maximum amount of time (counted from the date of the filing of a petition, complaint or application) permitted by statute for the competent investigating authority in question to make a final determination in an investigation. If review of the action taken by the competent investigating authority on remand is needed, such review shall be before the same panel, which shall normally issue a final decision within 90 days of the date on which such remand action is submitted to it. 9. The decision of a panel under this Article shall be binding on the involved Parties with respect to the particular matter between the Parties that is before the panel. 10. This Agreement shall not affect: (a) the judicial review procedures of any Party, or (b) cases appealed under those procedures, with respect to determinations other than final determinations. 11. A final determination shall not be reviewed under any judicial review procedures of the importing Party if an involved Party requests a panel with respect to that determination within the time limits set out in this Article. No Party may provide in its domestic legislation for an appeal from a panel decision to its domestic courts. 12. This Article shall not apply where: (a) neither involved Party seeks panel review of a final determination; (b) a revised final determination is issued as a direct result of judicial review of the original final determination by a court of the importing Party in cases where neither involved Party sought panel review of that original final determination; or (c) a final determination is issued as a direct result of judicial review that was commenced in a court of the importing Party before the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 13. 14. Where, within a reasonable time after the panel decision is issued, an involved Party alleges that: (a) (i) a member of the panel was guilty of gross misconduct, bias, or a serious conflict of interest, or otherwise materially violated the rules of conduct, (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, or (iii) the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction set out in this Article, for example by failing to apply the appropriate standard of review, and (b) any of the actions set out in subparagraph (a) has materially affected the panel's decision and threatens the integrity of the binational panel review process, that Party may avail itself of the extraordinary challenge procedure set out in Annex 1904.13. 14. To implement the provisions of this Article, the Parties shall adopt rules of procedure by January 1, 1994. Such rules shall be based, where appropriate, on judicial rules of appellate procedure, and shall include rules concerning: the content and service of requests for panels; a requirement that the competent investigating authority transmit to the panel the administrative record of the proceeding; the protection of business proprietary, government classified, and other privileged information (including sanctions against persons participating before panels for improper release of such information); participation by private persons; limitations on panel review to errors alleged by the Parties or private persons; filing and service; computation and extensions of time; the form and content of briefs and other papers; pre and posthearing conferences; motions; oral argument; requests for rehearing; and voluntary terminations of panel reviews. The rules shall be designed to result in final decisions within 315 days of the date on which a request for a panel is made, and shall allow: (a) 30 days for the filing of the complaint; (b) 30 days for designation or certification of the administrative record and its filing with the panel; (c) 60 days for the complainant to file its brief; (d) 60 days for the respondent to file its brief; (e) 15 days for the filing of reply briefs; (f) 15 to 30 days for the panel to convene and hear oral argument; and (g) 90 days for the panel to issue its written decision. 15. In order to achieve the objectives of this Article, the Parties shall amend their antidumping and countervailing duty statutes and regulations with respect to antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings involving goods of the other Parties, and other statutes and regulations to the extent that they apply to the operation of the antidumping and countervailing duty laws. In particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall: (a) amend its statutes or regulations to ensure that existing procedures concerning the refund, with interest, of antidumping or countervailing duties operate to give effect to a final panel decision that a refund is due; (b) amend its statutes or regulations to ensure that its courts shall give full force and effect, with respect to any person within its jurisdiction, to all sanctions imposed pursuant to the laws of the other Parties to enforce provisions of any protective order or undertaking that such other Party has promulgated or accepted in order to permit access for purposes of panel review or of the extraordinary challenge procedure to confidential, personal, business proprietary or other privileged information; (c) amend its statutes or regulations to ensure that (i) domestic procedures for judicial review of a final determination may not be commenced until the time for requesting a panel under paragraph 4 has expired, and (ii) as a prerequisite to commencing domestic judicial review procedures to review a final determination, a Party or other person intending to commence such procedures shall provide notice of such intent to the Parties concerned and to other persons entitled to commence such review procedures of the same final determination no later than 10 days prior to the latest date on which a panel may be requested; and (d) make the further amendments set out in its Schedule to Annex 1904.15. ARTICLE 1905: Safeguarding the Panel Review System 1. Where a Party alleges that the application of another Party's domestic law: (a) has prevented the establishment of a panel requested by the complaining Party; (b) has prevented a panel requested by the complaining Party from rendering a final decision; (c) has prevented the implementation of the decision of a panel requested by the complaining Party or denied it binding force and effect with respect to the particular matter that was before the panel; or (d) has resulted in a failure to provide opportunity for review of a final determination by a panel or court of competent jurisdiction that is independent of the competent investigating authorities, that examines the basis for the competent investigating authority's determination and whether the competent investigating authority properly applied domestic antidumping and countervailing duty law in reaching the challenged determination, and that employs the relevant standard of review identified in Article 1911, the Party may request in writing consultations with the other Party regarding the allegations. The consultations shall begin within 15 days of the date of the request. 2. 3. If the matter has not been resolved within 45 days of the request for consultations, or such other period as the consulting Parties may agree, the complaining Party may request the establishment of a special committee. 3. Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Parties, the special committee shall be established within 15 days of a request and perform its functions in a manner consistent with this Chapter. 4. The roster for special committees shall be that established under Annex 1904.13. 5. The special committee shall comprise three members selected in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex 1904.13. 6. The Parties shall establish rules of procedure in accordance with the principles set out in Annex 1905.6. 7. Where the special committee makes an affirmative finding with respect to one of the grounds specified in paragraph 1, the complaining Party and the Party complained against shall begin consultations within 10 days thereafter and shall seek to achieve a mutually satisfactory solution within 60 days of the issuance of the committee's report. 8. If, within the 60day period, the Parties are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory solution to the matter, or the Party complained against has not demonstrated to the satisfaction of the special committee that it has corrected the problem or problems with respect to which the committee has made an affirmative finding, the complaining Party may suspend: (a) the operation of Article 1904 with respect to the Party complained against; or (b) the application to the Party complained against of such benefits under this Agreement as may be appropriate under the circumstances. If the complaining Party decides to take action under this paragraph, it shall do so within 30 days after the end of the 60day consultation period. 9. In the event that a complaining Party suspends the operation of Article 1904 with respect to the Party complained against, the latter Party may reciprocally suspend the operation of Article 1904 within 30 days after the suspension of the operation of Article 1904 by the complaining Party. If either Party decides to suspend the operation of Article 1904, it shall provide written notice of such suspension to the other Party. 10. At the request of the Party complained against, the special committee shall reconvene to determine whether: (a) the suspension of benefits by the complaining Party pursuant to paragraph 8(b) is manifestly excessive; or (b) the Party complained against has corrected the problem or problems with respect to which the committee has made an affirmative finding. The special committee shall, within 45 days of the request, present a report to both Parties containing its determination. Where the special committee determines that the Party complained against has corrected the problem or problems, any suspension effected by the complaining Party or the Party complained against, or both, pursuant to paragraph 8 or 9 shall be terminated. 11. If the special committee makes an affirmative finding with respect to one of the grounds specified in paragraph 1, then effective as of the day following the date of issuance of the special committee's report: (a) binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee review under Article 1904 shall be stayed (i) in the case of review of any final determination of the complaining Party requested by the Party complained against, if such review was requested after the date on which consultations were requested pursuant to paragraph 1, and in no case more than 150 days prior to an affirmative finding by the special committee, or (ii) in the case of review of any final determination of the Party complained against requested by the complaining Party, at the request of the complaining Party; and (b) the time set out in Article 1904(4) or Annex 1904.13 for requesting panel or committee review shall not run unless and until resumed in accordance with paragraph 12. 12. If either Party suspends the operation of Article 1904 pursuant to paragraph 8(a), the panel or committee review stayed under paragraph 11(a) shall be terminated and the challenge to the final determination shall be irrevocably referred to the appropriate domestic court for decision, as provided below: (a) in the case of review of any final determination of the complaining Party requested by the Party complained against, at the request of either Party, or of a party to the panel review under Article 1904; or (b) in the case of review of any final determination of the Party complained against requested by the complaining Party, at the request of the complaining Party, or of a person of the complaining Party that is a party to the panel review under Article 1904. If either Party suspends the operation of Article 1904 pursuant to paragraph 8(a), any running of time suspended under paragraph 11(b) shall resume. If the suspension of the operation of Article 1904 does not become effective, panel or committee review stayed under paragraph 11(a), and any running of time suspended under paragraph 11(b), shall resume. 13. If the complaining Party suspends the application to the Party complained against of such benefits under the Agreement as may be appropriate under the circumstances pursuant to paragraph 8(b), panel or committee review stayed under paragraph 11(a), and any running of time suspended under paragraph 11(b), shall resume. 14. Each Party shall provide in its domestic legislation that, in the event of an affirmative finding by the special committee, the time for requesting judicial review of a final antidumping or countervailing duty determination shall not run unless and until the Parties concerned have negotiated a mutually satisfactory solution under paragraph 7, have suspended the operation of Article 1904 or the application of other benefits under paragraph 8. ARTICLE 1906: Prospective Application This Chapter shall apply only prospectively to: (a) final determinations of a competent investigating authority made after the date of entry into force of this Agreement; and (b) with respect to declaratory opinions under Article 1903, amendments to antidumping or countervailing duty statutes enacted after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. ARTICLE 1907: Consultations 1. The Parties shall consult annually, or on the request of any Party, to consider any problems that may arise with respect to the implementation or operation of this Chapter and recommend solutions, where appropriate. The Parties shall each designate one or more officials, including officials of the competent investigating authorities, to be responsible for ensuring that consultations occur, when required, so that the provisions of this Chapter are carried out expeditiously. 2. The Parties further agree to consult on: (a) the potential to develop more effective rules and disciplines concerning the use of government subsidies; and (b) the potential for reliance on a substitute system of rules for dealing with unfair transborder pricing practices and government subsidization. 3. 4. The competent investigating authorities of the Parties shall consult annually, or on the request of any Party, and may submit reports to the Commission, where appropriate. In the context of these consultations, the Parties agree that it is desirable in the administration of antidumping and countervailing duty laws to: (a) publish notice of initiation of investigations in the importing Party's official journal, setting forth the nature of the proceeding, the legal authority under which the proceeding is initiated, and a description of the goods at issue; (b) provide notice of the times for submissions of information and for decisions that the competent investigating authorities are expressly required by statute or regulations to make; (c) provide explicit written notice and instructions as to the information required from interested parties and reasonable time to respond to requests for information; (d) accord reasonable access to information, noting that in this context (i) "reasonable access" means access during the course of the investigation, to the extent practicable, so as to permit an opportunity to present facts and arguments as set out in paragraph (e); when it is not practicable to provide access to information during the investigation in such time as to permit an opportunity to present facts and arguments, reasonable access shall mean in time to permit the adversely affected party to make an informed decision as to whether to seek judicial or panel review, and (ii) "access to information" means access to representatives determined by the competent investigating authority to be qualified to have access to information received by that competent investigating authority, including access to confidential (business proprietary) information, but does not include information of such high degree of sensitivity that its release would lead to substantial and irreversible harm to the owner or which is required to be kept confidential in accordance with domestic law of a Party; any privileges arising under the domestic law of the importing Party relating to communications between the competent investigating authorities and a lawyer in the employ of, or providing advice to, those authorities may be maintained; (e) provide an opportunity for interested parties to present facts and arguments, to the extent time permits, including an opportunity to comment on the preliminary determination of dumping or of subsidization; (f) protect confidential (business proprietary) information received by the competent investigating authority to ensure that there is no disclosure except to representatives determined by the competent investigating authority to be qualified; (g) prepare administrative records, including recommendations of official advisory bodies that may be required to be kept, and any record of ex parte meetings that may be required to be kept; (h) provide disclosure of relevant information, including an explanation of the calculation or the methodology used to determine the margin of dumping or the amount of the subsidy, on which any preliminary or final determination of dumping or of subsidization is based, within a reasonable time after a request by interested parties; (i) provide a statement of reasons concerning the final determination of dumping or subsidization; and (j) provide a statement of reasons for final determinations concerning material injury to a domestic industry, threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishment of such an industry. Inclusion of an item in subparagraphs (a) through (j) is not intended to serve as guidance to a binational panel reviewing a final antidumping or countervailing duty determination pursuant to Article 1904 in determining whether such determination was in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing Party. ARTICLE 1908: Special Secretariat Provisions 1. Each Party shall establish a division within its section of the Secretariat established pursuant to Article 2002 to facilitate the operation of this Chapter, including the work of panels or committees that may be convened pursuant to this Chapter. 2. The Secretaries of the Secretariat shall act jointly to provide administrative assistance to all panels or committees established pursuant to this Chapter. The Secretary for the Section of the Party in which a panel or committee proceeding is held shall prepare a record thereof and shall preserve an authentic copy of the same in that Party's Section office. Such Secretary shall, on request, provide to the Secretary for the Section of any other Party a copy of such portion of the record as is requested, except that only public portions of the record shall be provided to the Secretary for the Section of any Party that is not an involved Party. 3. Each Secretary shall receive and file all requests, briefs and other papers properly presented to a panel or committee in any proceeding before it that is instituted pursuant to this Chapter and shall number in numerical order all requests for a panel or committee. The number given to a request shall be the file number for briefs and other papers relating to such request. 4. The Secretary for the Section of the Party in which a panel or committee proceeding is held shall forward to the Secretary for the Section of the other involved Party copies of all official letters, documents or other papers received or filed with that Party's Section office pertaining to any proceeding before a panel or committee, except for the administrative record, which shall be handled in accordance with paragraph 2. The Secretary for the Section of an involved Party shall provide on request to the Secretary for the Section of a Party that is not an involved Party in the proceeding a copy of such public documents as are requested. ARTICLE 1909: Code of Conduct The Parties shall, by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, exchange letters establishing a code of conduct for panelists and members of committees established pursuant to Articles 1903, 1904 and 1905. ARTICLE 1910: Miscellaneous On request of another Party, the competent investigating authority of a Party shall provide to the other Party copies of all public information submitted to it for purposes of an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation with respect to goods of that other Party. ARTICLE 1911: Definitions For purposes of this Chapter: administrative record means, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties and the other persons appearing before a panel: (a) all documentary or other information presented to or obtained by the competent investigating authority in the course of the administrative proceeding, including any governmental memoranda pertaining to the case, and including any record of ex parte meetings as may be required to be kept; (b) a copy of the final determination of the competent investigating authority, including reasons for the determination; (c) all transcripts or records of conferences or hearings before the competent investigating authority; and (d) all notices published in the official journal of the importing Party in connection with the administrative proceeding; antidumping statute as referred to in Articles 1902 and 1903 means "antidumping statute" of a Party as defined in Annex 1911; competent investigating authority means "competent investigating authority" of a Party as defined in Annex 1911; countervailing duty statute as referred to in Articles 1902 and 1903 means "countervailing duty statute" of a Party as defined in Annex 1911; domestic law for purposes of Article 1905(1) means a Party's constitution, statutes, regulations and judicial decisions to the extent they are relevant to the antidumping and countervailing duty laws; final determination means "final determination" of a Party as defined in Annex 1911; foreign interests includes exporters or producers of the Party whose goods are the subject of the proceeding or, in the case of a countervailing duty proceeding, the government of the Party whose goods are the subject of the proceeding; general legal principles includes principles such as standing, due process, rules of statutory construction, mootness and exhaustion of administrative remedies; goods of a Party means domestic products as these are understood in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; importing Party means the Party that issued the final determination; interested parties includes foreign interests; involved Party means: (a) the importing Party; or (b) a Party whose goods are the subject of the final determination; remand means a referral back for a determination not inconsistent with the panel or committee decision; and standard of review means the "standard of review" for each Party as defined in Annex 1911. Annex 1901.2: Establishment of Binational Panels 1. On the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall establish and thereafter maintain a roster of individuals to serve as panelists in disputes under this Chapter. The roster shall include judges or former judges to the fullest extent practicable. The Parties shall consult in developing the roster, which shall include at least 75 candidates. Each Party shall select at least 25 candidates, and all candidates shall be citizens of Canada, Mexico or the United States. Candidates shall be of good character, high standing and repute, and shall be chosen strictly on the basis of objectivity, reliability, sound judgment and general familiarity with international trade law. Candidates shall not be affiliated with a Party, and in no event shall a candidate take instructions from a Party. The Parties shall maintain the roster, and may amend it, when necessary, after consultations. 2. A majority of the panelists on each panel shall be lawyers in good standing. Within 30 days of a request for a panel, each involved Party shall appoint two panelists, in consultation with the other involved Party. The involved Parties normally shall appoint panelists from the roster. If a panelist is not selected from the roster, the panelist shall be chosen in accordance with and be subject to the criteria of paragraph 1. Each involved Party shall have the right to exercise four peremptory challenges, to be exercised simultaneously and in confidence, disqualifying from appointment to the panel up to four candidates proposed by the other involved Party. Peremptory challenges and the selection of alternative panelists shall occur within 45 days of the request for the panel. If an involved Party fails to appoint its members to a panel within 30 days or if a panelist is struck and no alternative panelist is selected within 45 days, such panelist shall be selected by lot on the 31st or 46th day, as the case may be, from that Party's candidates on the roster. 3. Within 55 days of the request for a panel, the involved Parties shall agree on the selection of a fifth panelist. If the involved Parties are unable to agree, they shall decide by lot which of them shall select, by the 61st day, the fifth panelist from the roster, excluding candidates eliminated by peremptory challenges. 4. On appointment of the fifth panelist, the panelists shall promptly appoint a chairman from among the lawyers on the panel by majority vote of the panelists. If there is no majority vote, the chairman shall be appointed by lot from among the lawyers on the panel. 5. Decisions of the panel shall be by majority vote and based on the votes of all members of the panel. The panel shall issue a written decision with reasons, together with any dissenting or concurring opinions of panelists. 6. Panelists shall be subject to the code of conduct established pursuant to Article 1909. If an involved Party believes that a panelist is in violation of the code of conduct, the involved Parties shall consult and if they agree, the panelist shall be removed and a new panelist shall be selected in accordance with the procedures of this Annex. 7. When a panel is convened pursuant to Article 1904 each panelist shall be required to sign: (a) an application for protective order for information supplied by the United States or its persons covering business proprietary and other privileged information; (b) an undertaking for information supplied by Canada or its persons covering confidential, personal, business proprietary and other privileged information; or (c) an undertaking for information supplied by Mexico or its persons covering confidential, business proprietary and other privileged information. 8. On a panelist's acceptance of the obligations and terms of an application for protective order or disclosure undertaking, the importing Party shall grant access to the information covered by such order or disclosure undertaking. Each Party shall establish appropriate sanctions for violations of protective orders or disclosure undertakings issued by or given to any Party. Each Party shall enforce such sanctions with respect to any person within its jurisdiction. Failure by a panelist to sign an application for a protective order or disclosure undertaking shall result in disqualification of the panelist. 9. If a panelist becomes unable to fulfill panel duties or is disqualified, proceedings of the panel shall be suspended pending the selection of a substitute panelist in accordance with the procedures of this Annex. 10. Subject to the code of conduct established pursuant to Article 1909, and provided that it does not interfere with the performance of the duties of such panelist, a panelist may engage in other business during the term of the panel. 11. While acting as a panelist, a panelist may not appear as counsel before another panel. 12. With the exception of violations of protective orders or disclosure undertakings, signed pursuant to paragraph 7, panelists shall be immune from suit and legal process relating to acts performed by them in their official capacity. Annex 1903.2: Panel Procedures Under Article 1903 1. The panel shall establish its own rules of procedure unless the Parties otherwise agree prior to the establishment of that panel. The procedures shall ensure a right to at least one hearing before the panel, as well as the opportunity to provide written submissions and rebuttal arguments.

Implementation of Panel Reports Article 2018: Implementation of Final Report 1.

For purposes of: (a) Part Two (Trade in Goods), except to the extent that a provision of that Part applies to services or investment, and (b) Part Three (Technical Barriers to Trade), except to the extent that a provision of that Part applies to services, GATT Article XX and its interpretative notes, or any equivalent provision of a successor agreement to which all Parties are party, are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. The Parties understand that the measures referred to in GATT Article XX(b) include environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and that GATT Article XX(g) applies to measures relating to the conservation of living and non-living exhaustible natural resources. 2. Provided that such measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties, nothing in: (a) Part Two (Trade in Goods), to the extent that a provision of that Part applies to services, (b) Part Three (Technical Barriers to Trade), to the extent that a provision of that Part applies to services, (c) Chapter Twelve (Cross-Border Trade in Services), and (d) Chapter Thirteen (Telecommunications), shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any Party of measures necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including those relating to health and safety and consumer protection.

Subject to paragraph 2 and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under paragraph 3, Article 1106(3), (4) and (5) (Investment - Performance Requirements) shall apply to taxation measures. 6. Article 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) shall apply to taxation measures except that no investor may invoke that Article as the basis for a claim under Article 1116 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on its Own Behalf) or 1117 (Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise), where it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation.
