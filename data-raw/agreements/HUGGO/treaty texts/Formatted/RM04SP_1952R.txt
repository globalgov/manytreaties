regulations for maritime hunting operations in the waters of the south pacificsource: ruster and simma, volume vii, p. 3608the delegates of chile, ecuador and peru, meeting at the first conference on the exploitation and conservation of the marine resources of the south pacific, convinced of the urgent need to regulate whaling without delay,considering:that it is the duty of governments to ensure the conservation and protection of the whale fauna found in the south pacific zone;that the hunting of whales must be regulated in order to prevent intensive exploitation liable to cause the temporary or permanent extinction of this animal species, to the consequent detriment of the economies of the countries of the south pacific;that the operation of this industry from land stations in itself imposes a limitation on whaling because of the immovability of these stations and the narrow radius of action of whaling ships;that land stations derive greater benefit from whaling than factory ships, since, in addition to the blubber, they also treat the meat and bones of whales for human and animal food;agreeto form a provisional permanent commission and, in that capacity, lay down the following regulations for whaling: article 1.whaling in the south pacific and, in particular, in the maritime zones situated within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the signatory countries, either by coastal industries or by factory ships, shall be subject to the norms laid down by the conference; the permanent commission of the conference, in agreement with the governments of the countries concerned, shall study and decide upon any change which is desirable to expand or improve such industries or to comply with future international commitments, without deviating from the statutes of the conference article 2.the authorities of the respective countries shall exercise control over whaling and supervise compliance with the provisions of these regulations, whether whaling operations are carried out from factory ships or from land stations article 3.for the purposes of the preceding article, existing whaling enterprises, and any which may be established in the future, must inscribe their names on the special register of the permanent commission, stating the number and location of land stations, the number and type of whaling facilities they possess, and the number and characteristics of the ships or vessels which make up their floating stations article 4.pelagic whaling may be carried out in the maritime zone within the jurisdiction or sovereignty of the signatory
