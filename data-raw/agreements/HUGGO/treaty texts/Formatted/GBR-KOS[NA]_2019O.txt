ARTICLE 6 Sufficiently worked or processed products 1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained shall be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Incorporated Annex II are fulfilled. The conditions referred to above indicate the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Incorporated Annex II, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that: (a) their total value does not exceed 10% of the ex-works price of the product; (b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of nonoriginating materials are not exceeded by virtue of this paragraph. This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 7. ARTICLE 7 Insufficient working or processing 1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 6 are satisfied: (a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage; (b) breaking-up and assembly of packages; (c) washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings; (d) ironing or pressing of textiles; (e) simple painting and polishing operations; (f) husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice; (g) operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps; (h) peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables; (i) sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting; (j) sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles); (k) simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations; (l) affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging; (m) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; (n) mixing of sugar with any material; (o) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts; (p) a combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (n); (q) slaughter of animals. 2. All operations carried out in the United Kingdom or in Kosovo on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1. ARTICLE 8 Unit of qualification 1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System. It follows that: (a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification; (b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol. 2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin. ARTICLE 9 Accessories, spare parts and tools Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question. ARTICLE 10 Sets Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15% of the ex-works price of the set. ARTICLE 11 Neutral elements In order to determine whether a product is an originating product, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture: (a) energy and fuel; (b) plant and equipment; (c) machines and tools; (d) goods which neither enter into the final composition of the product nor are intended to do so. TITLE III TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS ARTICLE 12 Principle of territoriality 1. Except as provided for in Articles 3, 4 and paragraph 3 of this Article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall be fulfilled without interruption in the United Kingdom, or in Kosovo. 2. Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 4, where originating goods exported from the United Kingdom or from Kosovo to another country return, they shall be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (a) the returning goods are the same as those exported; and (b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported. 3. The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the United Kingdom or Kosovo on materials exported from the United Kingdom or Kosovo and subsequently re-imported there, provided: (a) the said materials are wholly obtained in the United Kingdom or Kosovo or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 7 prior to being exported; and (b) it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (i) the re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials; and (ii) the total added value acquired outside the United Kingdom or Kosovo by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10% of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed. 4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the United Kingdom or Kosovo. However, where, in the list in Incorporated Annex II a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the nonoriginating materials incorporated in the territory of the Party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the United Kingdom or Kosovo by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage. 5. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, ‘total added value’ means all costs arising outside the United Kingdom or Kosovo, including the value of the materials incorporated there. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Incorporated Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 6(2) is applied. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products of Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System. 8. Any working or processing of the kind covered by the provisions of this Article and done outside the United Kingdom or Kosovo shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements. ARTICLE 13 Direct transport 1. The preferential treatment provided for under this Agreement shall apply only to products satisfying the requirements of this Protocol, which are transported directly between the Parties or through the territories of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 with which cumulation is applicable. However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition. Originating products may be transported by pipeline across a territory other than that of the Parties. 2. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing Party by the production of: (a) a single transport document covering the passage from the exporting Party through the country of transit; or (b) a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit: (i) giving an exact description of the products; (ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used; and (iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or (c) failing these, any substantiating documents. ARTICLE 14 Exhibitions 1. Originating products sent for exhibition in a country other than those referred to in Articles 3 and 4 with which cumulation is applicable, and sold after the exhibition for importation in the United Kingdom or Kosovo, shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement, provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (a) an exporter has consigned these products from the United Kingdom or Kosovo to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there; (b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in the United Kingdom or Kosovo; (c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and (d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition. 2. A proof of origin shall be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the United Kingdom or Kosovo in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition shall be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required. 3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control. TITLE IV DRAWBACK OR EXEMPTION ARTICLE 15 Prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties 1. Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the United Kingdom or in Kosovo for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in the United Kingdom or Kosovo to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind. 2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the United Kingdom or Kosovo to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there. 3. The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the nonoriginating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 8(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 9 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 10 when such items are non-originating. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which this Agreement applies. TITLE V PROOF OF ORIGIN ARTICLE 16 General requirements 1.

The texts of the origin declarations appear in Incorporated Annexes IV a and b. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, in the cases specified in Article 27, benefit from this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the proofs of origin referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 5 of Article 17 and paragraph 3 of Article 22 below, where cumulation involves only the United Kingdom, the European Union, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Turkey, the Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Kosovo, the proof of origin may be a movement certificate EUR.1 or an origin declaration.

For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions. 8. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate. 9. A movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession. 2. The duplicate issued in this way shall be endorsed with the following word in English: ‘DUPLICATE’ 3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED. 4. The duplicate, which shall bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED, shall take effect as from that date. ARTICLE 20 Issue of movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously When originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the United Kingdom or Kosovo, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the United Kingdom or Kosovo. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed. ARTICLE 21 Accounting segregation 1. Where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called ‘accounting segregation’ method (hereinafter referred to as the ‘method’) to be used for managing such stocks. 2. The method shall ensure that, for a specific reference-period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as ‘originating’ is the same as that which would have been obtained had there been physical segregation of the stocks. 3. The customs authorities may make the grant of authorisation, referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions deemed appropriate. 4. The method shall be applied and the application thereof shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured. 5. The beneficiary of the method may make out or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed. 6.

A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting Party, and shall be submitted within that period to the customs authorities of the importing Party. 2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. 3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date. ARTICLE 25 Submission of proof of origin Proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of this Agreement. ARTICLE 26 Importation by instalments Where, at the request of the importer and subject to the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment. ARTICLE 27 Exemptions from proof of origin 1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers’ personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, that declaration may be made on the customs declaration CN22 / CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document. 2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view. 3. Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1,200 in the case of products forming part of travellers’ personal luggage. ARTICLE 28 Supporting documents The documents referred to in Articles 17(3) and 22(5) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED, or an origin declaration or origin declaration EUR-MED may be considered as products originating in the United Kingdom, in Kosovo or in one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol may consist, inter alia, of the following: (a) direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal bookkeeping; (b) documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the United Kingdom or in Kosovo where these documents are used in accordance with national law; (c) documents proving the working or processing of materials in the United Kingdom or in Kosovo, issued or made out in the United Kingdom or in Kosovo, where these documents are used in accordance with national law; (d) movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED or origin declarations or origin declarations EUR-MED proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the United Kingdom or Kosovo in accordance with this Protocol, or in one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4, in accordance with rules of origin which are identical to the rules in this Protocol; (e) appropriate evidence concerning working or processing undergone outside the United Kingdom, Kosovo or the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 by application of Article 12, proving that the requirements of that Article have been satisfied.

The customs authorities of the importing Party shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED and the origin declarations and origin declarations EUR-MED submitted to them. ARTICLE 30 Discrepancies and formal errors 1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted. 2. Obvious formal errors, such as typing errors, on a proof of origin shall not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document. ARTICLE 31 Amounts expressed in euro 1. For the application of the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned. 2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of Article 22(1)(b) or Article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the Party concerned. 3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The Parties shall notify each other of the relevant amounts. 4. A Party may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5%. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15% in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion were to result in a decrease in that equivalent value. 5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Council at the request of any of the Parties. When carrying out this review, the Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Council shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro. TITLE VI ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION ARTICLE 32 Mutual assistance 1.

In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the United Kingdom and Kosovo shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED, the origin declarations and the origin declarations EUR-MED, and the correctness of the information given in these documents. ARTICLE 33 Verification of proofs of origin 1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. 2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing Party shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the origin declaration or the origin declaration EUR-MED, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the request for verification. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification. 3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. 4. If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. 5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results shall indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned may be considered as products originating in the United Kingdom, in Kosovo or in one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol. 6. If, in cases of reasonable doubt, there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences. ARTICLE 34 Dispute settlement Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 33 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, they shall be submitted to the Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Council.

ARTICLE 35 Penalties Penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products. ARTICLE 36 Free zones 1. The United Kingdom and Kosovo shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, when products originating in the United Kingdom or in Kosovo are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED at the exporter’s request, if the treatment or processing undergone complies with this Protocol. ARTICLE 37 Derogations The products listed below shall be excluded from cumulation provided for in Articles 3 and 4, save for cumulation with respect to the European Union (provided for in paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 3), if: (a) the country of final destination is the United Kingdom, and: (i) the materials used in the manufacture of these products are originating in the Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Kosovo; or (ii) these products have acquired their origin on the basis of working or processing carried out in any of the countries referred to in paragraph (a)(i); or (b) the country of final destination is Kosovo, and: (i) the materials used in the manufacture of these products are originating in the United Kingdom; or (ii) these products have acquired their origin on the basis of working or processing carried out in the United Kingdom.
