The Government of Australia shall, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of Australia, issue a licence to the master of any vessel licensed under this Subsidiary Agreement. 2. If an application for a licence for a master of any vessel licensed under this Subsidiary Agreement has been accepted by the competent Australian authorities, the Government of Australia shall not require that person to have in his possession, or to produce, the licence until due procedures have been completed for passing the licence to that person. ARTICLE VI 1. The Government of Australia shall determine, after consultation between the two Governments, the methods of and the terms and conditions with respect to: (a) applying for and issuing licences in respect of the vessels and masters; (b) preparing and reporting of catch and effort data in respect of the vessels; and (c) communicating between the vessels and the competent Australian authorities. 2.
