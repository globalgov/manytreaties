NA
ANNEX to article i.for the purposes of the present article, the terms " dried " and " salted " are exclusively applied to substances completely dried or completely saturated with salt ARTICLE 2.should cattle plague appear in the territory of one of the high contracting parties, the other high contracting parties shall have the right, as long as the danger of infection lasts, to prohibit the import of parts of animals and animal products which might convey infection ARTICLE 3.if anthrax takes a malignant form or appears in numerous scattered centres, or if swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease or sheep-pox take a malignant or epidemic form in the territory of one of the high contracting parties, the other parties may require that the animal products mentioned in article i shall be accompanied, in order to be admitted on import, by a certificate of origin and freedom from contamination enabling the products to be identified in conformity with the specimen attached to the present convention.this certificate must be signed or countersigned by a government veterinary official or by a veterinary surgeon duly authorised by the state to do so. it may only be issued if the origin and soundness of the products can be certified by veterinary inspection.when anthrax or sheep-pox are prevalent in the country of origin, the high contracting parties may require that the animal products mentioned in article 1, which may carry infection, be imported direct to establishments specially authorised for this purpose. the high contracting parties shall be entitled to lay down special provisions for the transport of the products to those establishments and their industrial use.it shall be clearly understood that the measures described above must not be adopted in regard to countries in which anthrax is prevalent in a sporadic form.in addition to the certificate of origin and freedom from contamination mentioned in the previous article, attestations may, in the case of a recrudescence of anthrax in the country of origin, be required on the importation of hides, skins, wool, hair bristles, bones and bone-meal. such attestations shall indicate that these animal products have been subjected, under the responsibility of the exporting state and by methods recognised by the high contracting parties concerned to be of proved effectiveness, either to disinfection or to examination with a view to ascertaining the presence of disease. special agreements regarding bones and bone-meal shall be necessary if treatment affording adequate guarantees that all anthrax germs have been destroyed appears to be impracticable.the attestations issued must state very accurately the methods of disinfection or examination employed. they should also indicate the measures taken to prevent, after disinfection, re-infection during transport.as regards completely salted skins and hides coming from public slaughter-houses under permanent veterinary supervision, it will be sufficient to produce the certificates of origin and freedom from contamination mentioned in article 3 ARTICLE 5.when, as a result of the traffic in animals or animal products, an infectious disease (other than rabies, dourine, contagious peri-pneumonia of cattle and glanders), notification of which in the health bulletin is obligatory under the international convention for the campaign against contagious diseases of animals of to-day's date, has been introduced from the territory of one of the high contracting parties into the territory of one of the other parties, the latter shall have the right, so long as the danger lasts, to prohibit the import of raw material of animal origin which might convey infection.the high contracting parties shall have the same right in the event of one of the diseases mentioned in the preceding paragraph being prevalent in the territory of one of them.trade in industrially scoured wool shall be exempt from this provision ARTICLE 6.in the case of goods covered by a collective sanitary attestation, the veterinary sanitary authorities of the ports, stations and warehouses may issue valid partial attestations to the same effect to accompany re-shipments forming parts of a consignment.it shall be open to the high contracting parties to require a certified copy of the collective sanitary attestation to be attached to the partial attestations ARTICLE 7.should the certificates of origin and freedom from contamination or the attestations provided for above not satisfy the requirements laid down in the preceding articles and thus not afford adequate guarantees, importing countries are authorised to refuse consignments at the frontier station, or to require either disinfection on import or examination with a view to ascertaining the presence of disease ARTICLE 8.if one of the high contracting parties discovers that irregularities have occurred, on importation, in the issue of the necessary certificates or attestations, it may prohibit the importation of the products enumerated in article i, but it shall at the same time inform the high contracting party or parties concerned - country of origin, of provenance or of transit - in order that they may adopt measures and impose penalties to punish such abuses and prevent their recurrence. if the complainant high contracting party considers that the measures adopted by the country or countries concerned do not afford the guarantees that it considers necessary, it may continue to prohibit the importation of the products enumerated in article 1, originating in or coming from the countries in question. it must nevertheless be prepared to take into consideration the proposals of the other high contracting party or parties intended to allow of the resumption of this trade and to enter into negotiations with them one this subject ARTICLE 9.nothing in the present convention shall affect the provisions of any other convention, treaty or agreement concluded or to be concluded between any of the high contracting parties, under which more favourable treatment than that laid down in the present convention for the import or import of the animal products enumerated in article 1 is or may in the future be granted for the export or import of the said products of a high contracting party.final provisions ARTICLE 10 (settlement of
