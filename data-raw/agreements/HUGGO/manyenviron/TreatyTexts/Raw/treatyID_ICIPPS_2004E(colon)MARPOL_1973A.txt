article 38(a) of the convention on the international maritime organization concerning the functions of the marine environment protection committee (the committee) conferred upon it by international conventions for the prevention and control of marine pollution,recalling also resolution mepc.19(22) by which the committee adopted the international code for the construction and equipment of ships carrying dangerous chemicals in bulk (ibc code),noting article 16 of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the "1973 convention") and article vi of the protocol of 1978 relating to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the "1978 protocol") which together specify the amendment procedure of the 197 PROTOCOL and confer upon the appropriate body of the organization the function of considering and adopting amendments to the 1973 convention, as modified by the 197 PROTOCOL (marpol 73/78),noting also that the maritime safety committee, at its seventy-eighth session, considered and approved the proposed amendments to the ibc code with a view to adoption under the provisions of the international convention for the safety of life at sea, 1974 (1974 solas convention),considering that it is highly desirable for the provisions of the ibc code, which are mandatory under both marpol 73/78 and the 1974 solas convention, to remain identical,having considered the proposed amendments to the ibc code,1. adopts, in accordance with article 16(2)(b), (c) and (d) of the 1973 convention, the amendments to the ibc code, the text of which is set out at the annex to the present resolution;2. determines, in accordance with article 16(2)(f)(iii) of the 1973 convention, that the amendments to the ibc code shall be deemed to have been accepted on 1 july 2006 unless, prior to that date, not less than one-third of the parties or parties, the combined merchant fleets of which constitute not less than 50 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant fleet, have communicated to the organization their objection to the amendments;3. invites the parties to note that, in accordance with article 16(2)(g)(ii) of the 1973 convention, the amendments to the ibc code shall enter into force on 1 january 2007 upon their acceptance in accordance with paragraph 2

are not parties to marpol 73/78; and6. invites the maritime safety committee to adopt the same amendments to the ibc code in accordance with article viii(b)(iv) of the 1974 solas convention, so that the provisions of the ibc code, which are mandatory under both marpol 73/78 and the 1974 solas convention, remain identical ANNEX 2004 amendments to the international code for the construction and equipment of ships carrying dangerous chemicals in bulk (ibc code) [1]the complete text of the ibc code is replaced by the following:"preamble1 the purpose of this code is to provide an international standard for the safe carriage, in bulk by sea, of dangerous chemicals and noxious liquid substances listed in chapter 17 of the code. the code prescribes the design and construction standards of ships, regardless of tonnage, involved in such carriage and the equipment they shall carry to minimize the risk to the ship, its crew and the environment, having regard to the nature of the products involved.2 the basic philosophy of the code is to assign, to each chemical tanker, one of the ship types according to the degree of the hazards of the products carried by such ships. each of the products may have one or more hazardous properties, including flammability, toxicity, corrosivity and reactivity, as well as the hazard they may present to the environment.3 throughout the development of the code it was recognized that it must be based upon sound naval architectural and engineering principles and the best understanding available as to the hazards of the various products covered. furthermore, chemical tanker design technology is not only a complex technology, but is rapidly evolving and therefore the code should not remain static. thus, the organization will periodically review the code, taking into account both experience and technical developments.4 amendments to the code involving requirements for new products and their conditions of carriage will be circulated as recommendations, on an interim basis, when adopted by the maritime safety committee (msc) and the marine environment protection committee (mepc) of the organization, in accordance with the provisions of article viii of the international convention for the safety of life at sea, 1974 (solas 74), and article 16 of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, 1973, as modified by the protocol of 1978 relating thereto (marpol 73/78), respectively, pending the entry into force of these amendments.5 the code primarily deals with ship design and equipment. in order to ensure the safe transport of the products, the total system must, however, be appraised. other important facets of the safe transport of the products, such as training, operation, traffic control and handling in port, are being, or will be, examined further by the organization.6 the development of the code has been greatly assisted by a number of organizations in consultative status such as the association of classification societies (iacs) and the international electrotechnical commission (iec).7 chapter 16 of the code, dealing with operational requirements of chemical tankers, highlights the regulations in other chapters that are operational in nature and mentions those other important safety features that are peculiar to chemical tanker operation.8 the layout of the code is in line with the international code for the construction and equipment of ships carrying liquefied gases in bulk (igc code), adopted by the maritime safety committee at its forty-eighth session. gas carriers may also carry in bulk liquid chemicals covered by this code, as prescribed in the igc code.9 the 1998 edition of the code was based on the original text as adopted by msc resolution msc.4(48). in response to resolution 15 of the international conference on marine pollution, 1973, the mepc, at its twenty-second session, adopted, by resolution mepc.19(22), the ibc code extended to cover marine pollution prevention aspects for the implementation of annex ii to marpol 73/78.10 this edition of the code includes amendments adopted by the following resolutions:[editor's note: following table has

certificate is not endorsed in accordance with 1.5.2.1.3 or 1.5.2.1.4; .3 upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another state. a new certificate shall only be issued when the government issuing the new certificate is fully satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the requirements of 1.5.3.1 and 1.5.3.2. in the case of a transfer between governments that are both a contracting government to the 1974 solas convention and a party to marpol 73/78, if requested within 3 months after the transfer has taken place, the government of the state whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the administration copies of the certificate carried by the ship before the transfer and, if available, copies of the relevant survey reports ARTICLE 2ship survival capability and location of cargo tanks2.1 general2.1.1 ships, subject to the code, shall survive the normal effects of flooding following assumed hull damage caused by some external force. in addition, to safeguard the ship and the environment, the cargo tanks of certain types of ships shall be protected from penetration in the case of minor damage to the ship resulting, for example, from contact with a jetty or tug, and given a measure of protection from damage in the case of collision or stranding, by locating them at specified minimum distances inboard from the ship's shell plating. both the assumed damage and the proximity of the cargo tanks to the ship's shell shall be dependent upon the degree of hazard presented by the products to be carried.2.1.2 ships subject to the code shall be designed to one of the following standards:.1 a type 1 ship is a chemical tanker intended to transport chapter 17 products with very severe environmental and safety hazards which require maximum preventive measures to preclude an escape of such cargo..2 a type 2 ship is a chemical tanker intended to transport chapter 17 products with appreciably severe environmental and safety hazards which require significant preventive measures to preclude an escape of such cargo..3 a type 3 ship is a chemical tanker intended to transport chapter 17 products with sufficiently severe environmental and safety hazards which require a moderate degree of containment to increase survival capability in a damaged condition.thus, a type 1 ship is a chemical tanker intended for the transportation of products considered to present the greatest overall hazard and type 2 and type 3 for products of progressively lesser hazards. accordingly, a type 1 ship shall survive the most severe standard of damage and its cargo tanks shall be located at the maximum prescribed distance inboard from the shell plating.2.1.3 the ship type required for individual products is indicated in column e in the table of chapter 17.2.1.4 if a ship is intended to carry more than one product listed in chapter 17, the standard of damage shall correspond to that product having the most stringent ship type requirement. the requirements for the location of individual cargo tanks, however, are those for ship types related to the respective products intended to be carried.2.2 freeboard and intact stability2.2.1 ships subject to the code may be assigned the minimum freeboard permitted by the international convention on load lines in force. however, the draught associated with the assignment shall not be greater than the maximum draught otherwise permitted by this code.2.2.2 the stability of the ship in all seagoing conditions shall be to a standard which is acceptable to the administration.2.2.3 when calculating the effect of free surfaces of consumable liquids for loading conditions it shall be assumed that, for each type of liquid, at least one transverse pair or a single centre tank has a free surface and the tank or combination of tanks to be taken into account shall be those where the effect of free surfaces is the greatest. the free surface effect in undamaged compartments shall be calculated by a method acceptable to the administration.2.2.4 solid ballast shall not normally be used in double-bottom spaces in the cargo area. where, however, because of stability considerations, the fitting of solid ballast in such spaces becomes unavoidable, then its disposition shall be governed by the need to ensure that the impact loads resulting from bottom damage are not directly transmitted to the cargo tank structure.2.2.5 the master of the ship shall be supplied with a loading and stability information booklet. this booklet shall contain details of typical service and ballast conditions, provisions for evaluating other conditions of loading and a summary of the ship's survival capabilities. in addition, the booklet shall contain sufficient information to enable the master to load and operate the ship in a safe and seaworthy manner.2.3 shipside discharges below the freeboard deck2.3.1 the provision and control of valves fitted to discharges led through the shell from spaces below the freeboard deck or from within the super-structures and deck-houses on the freeboard deck fitted with weathertight doors shall comply with the requirements of the relevant regulation of the international convention on load lines in force, except that the choice of valves shall be limited to:.1 one automatic non-return valve with a positive means of closing from above the freeboard deck; or.2 where the vertical distance from the summer load waterline to the inboard end of the discharge pipe exceeds 0.01l, two automatic non-return valves without positive means of closing, provided that the inboard valve is always accessible for examination under service conditions.2.3.2 for the purpose of this chapter, "summer load line" and "freeboard deck" have the meanings as defined in the international convention on load lines in force.2.3.3 the automatic non-return valves referred to in 2.3.1.1 and 2.3.1.2 shall be fully effective in preventing admission of water into the ship, taking into account the sinkage, trim and heel in survival requirements in 2.9, and shall comply with recognized standards.2.4 conditions of loadingdamage survival capability shall be investigated on the basis of loading information submitted to the administration for all anticipated conditions of loading and variations in draught and trim. ballast conditions where the chemical tanker is not carrying products covered by the code, or is carrying only residues of such products, need not be considered.2.5 damage assumptions2.5.1 the assumed maximum extent of damage shall be:[editor's note: following table has been converted from its original format, table can be found on page 17 of the original document].1 [tab] side damage: [tab] [tab] .1.1 [tab] longitudinal extent:

independent tanks below the upper limit of bottom damage shall not exceed 350 mm. suction wells installed in accordance with this paragraph may be ignored in determining the compartments affected by damage.2.7 flooding assumptions2.7.1 the requirements of 2.9 shall be confirmed by calculations which take into consideration the design characteristics of the ship; the arrangements, configuration and contents of the damaged compartments; the distribution, relative densities and the free surface effects of liquids; and the draught and trim for all conditions of loading.2.7.2 the permeabilities

envelope of such lesser damage shall be assumed to be penetrated.2.7.5 the ship shall be so designed as to keep unsymmetrical flooding to the minimum consistent with efficient arrangements.2.7.6 equalization arrangements requiring mechanical aids such as valves or cross-levelling pipes, if fitted, shall not be considered for the purpose of reducing an angle of heel or attaining the minimum range of residual stability to meet the requirements of 2.9 and sufficient residual stability shall be maintained during all stages where equalization is used. spaces which are linked by ducts of large cross-sectional area may be considered to be common.2.7.7 if pipes, ducts, trunks or tunnels are situated within the assumed extent of damage penetration, as defined in 2.5, arrangements shall be such that progressive flooding cannot thereby extend to compartments other than those assumed to be flooded for each case of damage.2.7.8 the buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side

administration.2.8.2 in the case of small type 2 and type 3 ships which do not comply in all respects with the appropriate requirements of 2.8.1.3 and 2.8.1.6, special dispensation may only be considered by the administration provided that alternative measures can be taken which maintain the same degree of safety. the nature of the alternative measures shall be approved and clearly stated

additional requirementsfor certain products, additional requirements contained in chapter 15 are shown in column o in the table of chapter 17 ARTICLE 8cargo tank venting and gas-freeing arrangements8.1 application8.1.1 unless expressly provided otherwise, this chapter applies to ships constructed on or after 1 january 1994.8.1.2 ships constructed before 1 january 1994 shall comply with the requirements of chapter 8 of this code which were in force prior to the said date.8.1.3 for the purpose of this regulation, the term "ship constructed" is as defined in solas regulation ii-1/1.3.1.8.1.4 ships constructed on or after 1 july 1986 but before 1 january 1994 which fully comply with the requirements of the code applicable at that time may be regarded as complying with the requirements of solas regulations ii-2/4.5.3, 4.5.6 to 4.5.8, 4.5.10 and 11.6.8.1.5 for ships to which the code applies, the requirements of this chapter shall apply in lieu of solas regulations ii-2/4.5.3 and 4.5.6.8.1.6 ships constructed on or after 1 july 1986, but before 1 july 2002 shall comply with the requirements of 8.3.3.8.2 cargo tank venting8.2.1 all cargo tanks shall be provided with a venting system appropriate to the cargo being carried and these systems shall be independent of the air pipes and venting systems of all other compartments of the ship. tank venting systems shall be designed so as to minimize the possibility of cargo vapour accumulating about the decks, entering accommodation, service and machinery spaces and control stations and, in the case of flammable vapours, entering or collecting in spaces or areas containing sources of ignition. tank venting systems shall be arranged to prevent entrance of water into the cargo tanks and, at the same time, vent outlets shall direct the vapour discharge upwards in the form of unimpeded jets.8.2.2 the venting systems shall be connected to the top of each cargo tank and as far as practicable the cargo vent lines shall be self-draining back to the cargo tanks under all normal operational conditions of list and trim. where it is necessary to drain venting systems above the level of any pressure/vacuum valve, capped or plugged drain cocks shall be provided.8.2.3 provision shall be made to ensure that the liquid head in any tank does not exceed the design head of the tank. suitable high-level alarms, overflow control systems or spill valves, together with gauging and tank filling procedures, may be accepted for this purpose. where the means of limiting cargo tank overpressure includes an automatic closing valve, the valve shall comply with the appropriate provisions of 15.19.8.2.4 tank venting systems shall be designed and operated so as to ensure that neither pressure nor vacuum created in the cargo tanks during loading or unloading exceeds tank design parameters. the main factors to be considered in the sizing of a tank venting system are as follows:.1 design loading and unloading rate;.2 gas evolution during loading: this shall be taken account of by multiplying the maximum loading rate by a factor of at least 1.25;.3 density of the cargo vapour mixture;.4 pressure loss in vent piping and across valves and fittings; and.5 pressure/vacuum settings of relief devices.8.2.5 tank vent piping connected to cargo tanks of corrosion-resistant material, or to tanks which are lined or coated to handle special cargoes as required by the code, shall be similarly lined or coated or constructed of corrosion-resistant material.8.2.6 the master shall be provided with the maximum permissible loading and unloading rates for each tank or group of tanks consistent with the design of the venting systems.8.3 types of tank venting systems8.3.1 an open tank venting system is a system which offers no restriction except for friction losses to the free flow of cargo vapours to and from the cargo tanks during normal operations. an open venting system may consist of individual vents from each tank, or such individual vents may be combined into a common header or headers, with due regard to cargo segregation. in no case shall shutoff valves be fitted either to the individual vents or to the header.8.3.2 a controlled tank venting system is a system in which pressure- and vacuum-relief valves or pressure/vacuum valves are fitted to each tank to limit the pressure or vacuum in the tank. a controlled venting system may consist of individual vents from each tank or such individual vents on the pressure side only as may be combined into a common header or headers, with due regard to cargo segregation. in no case shall shut-off valves be fitted either above or below pressure- or vacuum-relief valves or pressure/vacuum valves. provision may be made for bypassing a pressure- or vacuum-relief valve or pressure/vacuum valve under certain operating conditions provided that the requirement of 8.3.6 is maintained and that there is suitable indication to show whether or not the valve is bypassed.8.3.3 controlled tank venting systems shall consist of a primary and a secondary means of allowing full flow relief of vapour to prevent over-pressure or under-pressure in the event of failure of one means. alternatively, the secondary means may consist of pressure sensors fitted in each tank with a monitoring system in the ship's cargo control room or position from which cargo operations are normally carried out. such monitoring equipment shall also provide an alarm facility which is activated by detection of over-pressure or under-pressure conditions within a tank.8.3.4 the position of vent outlets of a controlled tank venting system shall be arranged:.1 at a height of not less than 6 m above the weather deck or above a raised walkway if fitted within 4 m of the raised walkway; and.2 at a distance of at least 10 m measured horizontally from the nearest air intake or opening to accommodation, service and machinery spaces and ignition sources.8.3.5 the vent outlet height referred to in 8.3.4.1 may be reduced to 3 m above the deck or a raised walkway, as applicable, provided that high-velocity venting valves of an approved type, directing the vapour/air mixture upwards in an unimpeded jet with an exit velocity of at least 30 m/s, are fitted.8.3.6 controlled tank venting systems fitted to tanks to be used for cargoes having a flashpoint not exceeding 60°c (closed-cup test) shall be provided with devices to prevent the passage of flame into the cargo tanks. the design, testing and locating of the devices shall comply with the requirements of the administration, which shall contain at least the standards adopted by the organization.8.3.7 in designing venting systems and in the selection of devices to prevent the passage of flame for incorporation into the tank venting system, due attention shall be paid to the possibility of the blockage of these systems and fittings by, for example, the freezing of cargo vapour, polymer build-up, atmospheric dust or icing up in adverse weather conditions. in this context it shall be noted that flame arresters and flame screens are more susceptible to blockage. provisions shall be made such that the system and fittings may be inspected, operationally checked, cleaned or renewed as applicable.8.3.8 reference in 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 to the use of shutoff valves in the venting lines shall be interpreted to extend to all other means of stoppage, including spectacle blanks and blank flanges.8.4 venting requirements for individual productsventing requirements for individual products are shown in column g, and additional requirements in column o in the table of chapter 17.8.5 cargo tank gas-freeing8.5.1 the arrangements for gas-freeing cargo tanks used for cargoes other than those for which open venting is permitted shall be such as to minimize the hazards due to the dispersal of flammable or toxic vapours in the atmosphere and to flammable or toxic vapour mixtures in a cargo tank. accordingly, gas-freeing operations shall be carried out such that vapour is initially discharged:.1 through the vent outlets specified in 8.3.4 and 8.3.5; or.2 through outlets at least 2 m above the cargo tank deck level with a vertical exit velocity of at least 30 m/s maintained during the gas-freeing operation; or3 through outlets at least 2 m above the cargo tank deck level with a vertical exit velocity of at least 20 m/s which are protected by suitable devices to prevent the passage of flame.when the flammable vapour concentration at the outlets has been reduced to 30% of the lower flammable limit and, in the case of a toxic product, the vapour concentration does not present a significant health hazard, gas-freeing may thereafter be continued at cargo tank deck level.8.5.2 the outlets referred to in 8.5.1.2 and 8.5.1.3 may be fixed or portable pipes.8.5.3 in designing a gas-freeing system in conformity with 8.5.1, particularly in order to achieve the required exit velocities of 8.5.1.2 and 8.5.1.3, due consideration shall be given to the following:.1 materials of construction of system;.2 time to gas-free;.3 flow characteristics of fans to be used;.4 the pressure losses created by ducting, piping, cargo tank inlets and outlets;.5 the pressure achievable in the fan driving medium (e.g. water or compressed air); and.6 the densities of the cargo vapour/air mixtures for the range of cargoes to be carried ARTICLE 9environmental control9.1 general9.1.1 vapour spaces within cargo tanks and, in some cases, spaces surrounding cargo tanks may require to have specially controlled atmospheres.9.1.2 there are four different types of control for cargo tanks, as follows:.1 inerting: by filling the cargo tank and associated piping systems and, where specified in chapter 15, the spaces surrounding the cargo tanks, with a gas or vapour which will not support combustion and which will not react with the cargo, and maintaining that condition..2 padding: by filling the cargo tank and associated piping systems with a liquid, gas or vapour which separates the cargo from the air, and maintaining that condition..3 drying: by filling the cargo tank and associated piping systems with moisture-free gas or vapour with a dewpoint of -40°c or below at atmospheric pressure, and maintaining that condition..4 ventilation: forced or natural.9.1.3 where inerting or padding of cargo tanks is required:1 an adequate supply of inert gas for use in filling and discharging the cargo tanks shall be carried or shall be manufactured on board unless a shore supply is available. in addition, sufficient inert gas shall be available on the ship to compensate for normal losses during transportation..2 the inert gas system on board the ship shall be able to maintain a pressure of at least 0.007 mpa gauge within the containment system at all times. in addition, the inert gas system shall not raise the cargo tank pressure to more than the tank's relief-valve setting..3 where padding is used, similar arrangements for supply of the padding medium shall be made as required for inert gas in 9.1.3.1 and 9.1.3.2..4 means shall be provided for monitoring ullage spaces containing a gas blanket to ensure that the correct atmosphere is being maintained..5 inerting or padding arrangements or both, where used with flammable cargoes, shall be such as to minimize the creation of static electricity during the admission of the inerting medium.9.1.4 where drying is used and dry nitrogen is used as the medium, similar arrangements for supply of the drying agent shall be made to those required in 9.1.3. where drying agents are used as the drying medium on all air inlets to the tank, sufficient medium shall be carried for the duration of the voyage, taking into consideration the diurnal temperature range and the expected humidity.9.2 environmental control requirements for individual productsthe required

appropriate steps to ensure uniformity in the implementation and the application of the provisions of this chapter in respect of electrical installations.10.1.4 electrical equipment, cables and wiring shall not be installed in the hazardous locations unless it conforms with the standards not inferior to those acceptable to the organization*. however, for locations not covered by such standards, electrical equipment, cables and wiring which do not conform to the standards may be installed in hazardous locations based on a risk assessment to the satisfaction of the administration, to ensure that an equivalent level of safety is assured.10.1.5 where electrical equipment is installed in hazardous locations, as permitted in this chapter, it shall be to the satisfaction of the administration and certified by the relevant authorities recognized by the administration for operation in the flammable atmosphere concerned, as indicated in column i in the table of chapter 17.10.1.6 for guidance,

solutions. the procedures for inspection and cleaning, as given in paragraphs 15.5.3.2 to 15.5.3.8 below, apply to both stainless steel and pure aluminium tanks (see paragraph 15.5.2.2). procedures for passivation are given in paragraph 15.5.3.9 for stainless steel and 15.5.3.10 for aluminium. unless otherwise specified, all steps apply to the tanks and to all associated equipment having been in contact with the other cargo.15.5.3.2 after unloading the previous cargo the tank shall be rendered safe and inspected for any residues, scale and rust.15.5.3.3 tanks and associated equipment shall be washed with clean filtered water. the water to be used shall at least have the quality of potable water with a low chlorine content.15.5.3.4 trace residues and vapours of the previous cargo shall be

and passivated, regardless of any previous passivation, according to the following procedure:.1 new welds and other repaired parts shall be cleaned and finished using stainless steel wire brush, chisel, sandpaper or buff. rough surfaces shall be given a smooth finish. a final polishing is necessary..2 fatty and oily residues shall be removed by the use of appropriate organic solvents or detergent solutions in water. the use of chlorine-containing compounds shall be avoided as they can seriously interfere with passivation..3 the residues of the degreasing agent shall be removed, followed by a washing with water..4 in the next step, scale and rust shall be removed by the application of acid (e.g. a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids), followed again by a washing with clean water..5 all the metal surfaces which can come into contact with hydrogen peroxide shall be passivated by the application of nitric acid of a concentration between 10 and 35% by mass. the nitric acid must be free from heavy metals, other oxidizing agents or hydrogen fluoride. the passivation process shall continue for 8 to 24 h, depending upon the concentration of acid, the ambient temperature and other factors. during this time a continuous contact between the surfaces to be passivated and the nitric acid shall be ensured. in the case of large surfaces this may be achieved by recirculating the acid. hydrogen gas may be evolved in the passivation process, leading to the presence of an explosive atmosphere in the tanks. therefore, appropriate measures must be taken to avoid the build-up or the ignition of such an atmosphere..6 after passivation the surfaces shall be thoroughly washed with clean filtered water. the washing process shall be repeated until the effluent water has the same ph value as the incoming water..7 surfaces treated according to the above steps may cause some decomposition when coming into contact with hydrogen peroxide for the first time. this decomposition will cease after a short time (usually within two or three days). therefore an additional flushing with hydrogen peroxide for a period of at least two days is recommended..8 only degreasing agents and acid cleaning agents which have been recommended for this purpose by the manufacturer of the hydrogen peroxide shall be used in the process.15.5.3.10 tanks and equipment made from aluminium and which have contained cargoes other than hydrogen peroxide, or which have been under repair, shall be cleaned and passivated. the following is an example of a recommended procedure:.1 the tank shall be washed with a solution of a sulphonated detergent in hot water, followed by a washing with water..2 the surface shall then be treated for 15 to 20 min with a solution of sodium hydroxide of a concentration of 7% by mass or treated for a longer period with a less concentrated solution (e.g. for 12 h with 0.4 to 0.5% sodium hydroxide). to prevent excessive corrosion at the bottom of the tank when treating with more concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide, water shall be added continuously to dilute the sodium hydroxide solution which collects there..3 the tank shall be thoroughly washed with clean, filtered water. as soon as possible after washing, the surface shall be passivated by the application of nitric acid of a concentration between 30 and 35% by mass. the passivation process shall continue for 16 to 24 h. during this time a continuous contact between the surfaces to be passivated and the nitric acid shall be ensured..4 after passivation the surfaces shall be thoroughly washed with clean, filtered water. the washing process shall be repeated until the effluent water has the same ph value as the incoming water..5 a visual inspection shall be made to ensure that all surfaces have been treated. it is recommended that an additional flushing is carried out for a minimum of 24 h with dilute hydrogen peroxide solution of a concentration approximately 3% by mass.15.5.3.11 the concentration and stability of the hydrogen peroxide solution to be loaded shall be determined.15.5.3.12 the hydrogen peroxide is loaded under intermittent visual supervision of the interior of the tank from an appropriate opening.15.5.3.13 if substantial bubbling is observed which does not disappear within 15 min after the completion of loading, the contents of the tank shall be unloaded and disposed of in an environmentally safe manner. the tank and equipment shall then be repassivated as described above.15.5.3.14 the concentration and stability of the hydrogen peroxide solution shall be determined again. if the same values are obtained within the limits of error as in paragraph 15.5.3.10, the tank is considered to be properly passivated and the cargo ready for shipment.15.5.3.15 actions described in paragraphs 15.5.3.2 to 15.5.3.8 shall be carried out under the supervision of the master or shipper. actions described in paragraphs 15.5.3.9 to 15.5.3.15 shall be carried out under the on-site supervision and responsibility of a representative of the hydrogen peroxide manufacturer or under supervision and responsibility of another person familiar with the safety-relevant properties of hydrogen peroxide.15.5.3.16 the following procedure shall be applied when tanks having contained hydrogen peroxide solution are to be used for other products (unless otherwise specified, all steps apply to the tanks and to all associated equipment having been in contact with hydrogen peroxide):.1 hydrogen peroxide cargo residue shall be drained as completely as possible from tanks and equipment..2 tanks and equipment shall be rinsed with clean water, and subsequentlythoroughly washed with clean water..3 the interior of the tank shall be dried and inspected for any residues.steps .1 to .3, in 15.5.3.16, shall be carried out under the supervision of the master or the shipper. step .3 in paragraph 15.5.3.16 shall be carried out by a person familiar with the safety-relevant properties of the chemical to be transported and of hydrogen peroxide.special cautions :.1 hydrogen peroxide decomposition may enrich the atmosphere with oxygen and appropriate precautions shall be observed..2 hydrogen gas may be evolved in the passivation processes described in paragraphs 15.5.3.9.5, 15.5.3.10.2 and 15.5.3.10.4, leading to the presence of an explosive atmosphere in the tank. therefore, appropriate measures must be taken to avoid the build-up or the ignition of such an atmosphere.15.6 motor fuel anti-knock compounds (containing lead alkyls)15.6.1 tanks used for these cargoes shall not be used for the transportation of any other cargo except those commodities to be used in the manufacture of motor fuel anti-knock

liquid chemical wastes could present a threat to human health and to the environment.20.1.2 liquid chemical wastes shall, therefore, be transported in accordance with relevant international conventions and recommendations and, in particular, where it concerns maritime transport in bulk, with the requirements of this code.20.2 definitionsfor the purpose of this chapter:20.2.1 liquid chemical wastes are substances, solutions or mixtures, offered for shipment, containing or contaminated with one or more constituents which are subject to the requirements of this code and for which no direct use is envisaged but which are carried for dumping, incineration or other methods of disposal other than at sea.20.2.2 transboundary movement means maritime transport of wastes from an area under the national jurisdiction of one country to or through an area under the national jurisdiction of another country, or to or through an area not under the national jurisdiction of any country, provided at least two countries are concerned by the movement.20.3 applicability20.3.1 the requirements of this chapter are applicable to the transboundary movement of liquid chemical wastes in bulk by seagoing ships and shall be considered in conjunction with all other requirements of this code.20.3.2 the requirements of this chapter do not apply to:.1 wastes derived from shipboard operations which are covered by the requirements of marpol 73/78; and.2 substances, solutions or mixtures containing or contaminated with radioactive materials which are subject to the applicable requirements for radioactive materials.20.4 permitted shipments20.4.1 transboundary movement of wastes is permitted to commence only when:.1 notification has been sent by the competent authority of the country of origin, or by the generator or exporter through the channel of the competent authority of the country of origin, to the country of final destination; and .2 the competent authority of the country of origin, having received the written consent of the country of final destination stating that the wastes will be safely incinerated or treated by other methods of disposal, has given authorization to the movement.20.5 documentation20.5.1 in addition to the documentation specified in 16.2 of this code, ships engaged in transboundary movement of liquid chemical wastes shall carry on board a waste movement document issued by the competent authority of the country of origin.20.6 classification of liquid chemical wastes20.6.1 for the purpose of the protection of the marine environment, all liquid chemical wastes transported in bulk shall be treated as category x noxious liquid substances, irrespective of the actual evaluated category.20.7 carriage and handling of liquid chemical wastes20.7.1 liquid chemical wastes shall be carried in ships and cargo tanks in accordance with the minimum requirements for liquid chemical wastes specified in chapter 17, unless there are clear grounds indicating that the hazards of the wastes would warrant:.1 carriage in accordance with the ship type 1 requirements; or.2 any additional requirements of this code applicable to the substance or, in case the of a mixture, its constituent presenting the predominant hazard ARTICLE 21criteria for assigning carriage requirements for products subject to the ibc code21.1 introduction21.1.1 the following criteria are guidelines for the determination of pollution classification and assignment of appropriate carriage requirements for bulk liquid cargoes being considered as candidates for entry into the ibc code or annexes 1, 3 or 4 of mepc.2/circs.21.1.2 in developing such criteria, every effort has been made to follow the criteria and cut off points developed under the global harmonized system (ghs).21.1.3 although the criteria are intended to be closely defined in order to establish a uniform approach, it must be emphasized that these are guidelines only and, where human experience or other factors indicates the need for alternative arrangements, these shall always be taken into account. where deviations from the criteria have been recognized, they shall be properly recorded with justifications.21.2 contents21.2.1 this chapter contains the following:.1 minimum safety and pollution criteria for products subject to chapter 17 of the ibc code;.2 criteria used to assign the minimum carriage requirements for products, which meet the safety or pollution criteria to make them subject to chapter 17 of the ibc code;.3 criteria used for special requirements in chapter 15 of the ibc code to be included in column o of chapter 17 of the ibc code;.4 criteria used for special requirements in chapter 16 of the ibc code to be included in column o of chapter 17 of the ibc code; and.5 definitions of properties used within this chapter.21.3 minimum safety and pollution criteria for products subject to chapter 17 of the ibc code21.3.1 products are deemed to be hazardous and subject to chapter 17 of the ibc code if they meet one or more of the following criteria:.1 inhalation lc50 20 mg/l/4 h (see definitions in paragraph 21.7.1.1);.2 dermal ld50 2000 mg/kg (see

exposure if it meets any of the following criteria: it is known to be, or suspected of being a carcinogen, mutagen, reprotoxic, neurotoxic, immunotoxic or exposure below the lethal dose is known to cause specific organ oriented systemic toxicity (tost) or other related effects.21.7.2.2 such effects may be identified from the gesamp hazard profile of the product or other recognized sources of such information.21.7.3 skin sensitization21.7.3.1 a product is classified as a skin sensitizer:.1 if there is evidence in humans that the substance can induce sensitization by skin contact in a substantial number of persons; or.2 where there are positive results from an appropriate animal test.21.7.3.2 when an adjuvant type test method for skin sensitization is used, a response of at least 30% of the animals is considered as positive. for a non-adjuvant test method a response of at least 15% of the animals is considered positive.21.7.3.3 when a positive result is obtained from the mouse ear swelling test (mest) or the local lymph node assay (llna), this may be sufficient to classify the product as a skin sensitizer.21.7.4 respiratory sensitization21.7.4.1 a product is classified as a respiratory sensitizer:.1 if there is evidence in humans that the substance can induce specific respiratory hypersensitivity; and/or.2 where there are positive results from an appropriate animal test; and/or.3 where the product is identified as a skin sensitizer and there is no evidence to show that it is not a respiratory sensitizer.21.7.5 corrosive to skin [8][editor's note: following table has

document]water reactive index (wri) [tab] definition2 [tab] any chemical which, in contact with water, may produce a toxic, flammable or corrosive gas or aerosol.1 [tab] any chemical which, in contact with water, may generate heat or produce a non-toxic, non-flammable or non corrosive gas.0 [tab] any chemical which, in contact with water, would not undergo a reaction to justify a value of 1 or 2.21.7.7 air reactive substances21.7.7.1 air reactive substances are products which react with air to cause a potentially hazardous situation, e.g. the formation of peroxides which may cause an explosive reaction.21.7.8 electrical apparatus - temperature class (for products which either have a flashpoint of 60oc or are heated to within 15°c of their flashpoint)21.7.8.1 the temperature class is defined by the international electrotechnical commission (iec) as:the highest temperature attained under practical conditions of operation within the rating of the apparatus (and recognized overloads, if any, associated therewith) by any part of any surface, the exposure of which to an explosive atmosphere may involve a risk.21.7.8.2 the temperature class of the electrical apparatus is assigned by selecting the maximum surface temperature which is closest to, but less than, the product's autoignition temperature (see 21.4.9.1.1).21.7.9 electrical apparatus - apparatus group (for products with a flashpoint of 60oc)21.7.9.1 this refers to intrinsically safe and associated electrical apparatus for explosive gas atmospheres which the iec divide into the following groups:group i: for mines susceptible to firedamp (not used by imo); andgroup ii: for applications in other industries - further sub-divided according to its maximum experimental safe gap (mesg) and/or the minimum igniting current (mic) of the gas/vapour into groups iia, iib and iic.21.7.9.2 this property cannot be determined from other data associated with the product; it has to be either measured or assigned by assimilation with related products in an homologous series.21.7.10 special carriage control conditions21.7.10.1 special carriage control conditions refer to specific measures that need to be taken in order to either prevent a hazardous reaction. they include:.1 inhibition: the addition of a compound (usually organic) that retards or stops an undesired chemical reaction such as corrosion, oxidation or polymerization;.2 stabilization: the addition of a substance (stabilizer) that tends to keep a compound, mixture or solution from changing its form or chemical nature. such stabilizers may retard a reaction rate, preserve a chemical equilibrium, act as antioxidants, keep pigments and other components in emulsion form or prevent the particles in colloidal suspension from precipitating;.3 inertion: the addition of a gas (usually nitrogen) in the ullage space of a tank that prevents the formation of a flammable cargo/air mixture;.4 temperature control: the maintenance of a specific temperature range for the cargo in order to prevent a hazardous reaction or to keep the viscosity low enough to allow the product to be pumped; and.5 padding and venting: only applies to specific products identified on a case by case basis.21.7.11 flammable cargoes21.7.11.1 a cargo is defined as flammable according to the following criteria:[editor's note: following table has been converted from its original format, table can be found on page 158 of the original document]ibc code descriptor [tab] flash point (degrees centigrade)highly flammable [tab] 23flammable [tab] 2321.7.11.2 it should be noted that flash points of mixtures and aqueous solutions need to be measured unless all of the components are non-flammable.21.7.11.3 it should be noted that the carriage of bulk liquid cargoes which have a flash point of 60°c is subject to other solas regulations APPENDIX model form of international certificate of fitness for the carriage of dangerous chemicals in
