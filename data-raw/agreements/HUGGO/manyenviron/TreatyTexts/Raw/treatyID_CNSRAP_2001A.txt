agreement on the conservation of albatrosses and petrelssource: the contracting parties,recalling that the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals, 1979, (the convention) encourages international cooperative action to conserve and manage migratory species, and that its parties are encouraged to conclude agreements on wild animals which periodically cross national jurisdictional boundaries;considering that the fifth meeting of the conference of parties to the convention, held in geneva in april 1997, listed all southern hemisphere albatross species on either appendix i or ii;recalling that the sixth meeting of the conference of parties to the convention, held in south africa in november 1999, listed a number of petrel species on appendix ii, noted the threats posed by fisheries by-catch in general to a wide range of species, and in particular to albatrosses and petrels, and requested relevant parties to develop an agreement, under the convention, for the conservation of southern hemisphere albatrosses;appreciating the work of the group of temperate southern hemisphere countries on the environment (known as the valdivia group) in considering the need to address the threats posed to southern hemisphere albatross populations, and the work of australia in taking forward this need in the context of the convention;recognising that albatrosses and petrels are an integral part of marine ecosystems which must be conserved for the benefit of present and future generations, and that their conservation is a matter of common concern, particularly in the southern hemisphere;aware that the conservation status of albatrosses and petrels can be adversely affected by factors such as degradation and disturbance of their habitats, pollution, reduction of food resources, use and abandonment of non-selective fishing gear, and specifically by incidental mortality as a result of commercial fishing activities;convinced that the vulnerability of southern hemisphere albatrosses and petrels to such threats warrants the implementation of specific conservation measures, where they do not already exist, by range states;acknowledging that, notwithstanding past or ongoing scientific research, knowledge of the biology, ecology and population dynamics of albatrosses and petrels is limited, and that it is necessary to develop cooperative research and monitoring of these species in order to implement fully effective and efficient conservation measures;conscious of the cultural significance of albatrosses and petrels to some indigenous peoples;convinced that the conclusion of a multilateral agreement and its implementation through coordinated, concerted actions will contribute significantly to the conservation of southern hemisphere albatrosses and petrels and their habitats in the most effective and efficient manner;noting that northern hemisphere albatrosses and petrels may in future benefit from incorporation into this agreement with a view to promoting co-ordinated conservation actions between range states;recalling the obligation in the united nations convention on the law of the sea, 1982, to protect and preserve the marine environment;recognising the significance of the antarctic treaty, 1959, and the convention on the conservation of antarctic marine living resources, 1980, whose commission has adopted conservation measures to reduce incidental catch within the area of application of that convention, particularly of albatrosses and petrels;recognising further that the convention for the conservation of southern bluefin tuna, 1992, enables its commission to adopt conservation measures to reduce the incidental catch of seabirds;acknowledging that the food and agriculture organization of the united nations international plan of action for reducing incidental catch of seabirds in longline fisheries was adopted in 1999, and that a number of conventions relating to the conservation and management of marine living resources have the capacity to contribute positively to the conservation of albatrosses and petrels;recognising the rio declaration on environment and development, 1992, principle 15, that, in order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach should be widely applied;recalling further that the convention on biological diversity, 1992, obliges its parties to cooperate with each other or through competent international organisations to conserve biological diversity,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE iscope, definitions and interpretation1. this agreement shall apply to

part of this annex ANNEX 2action plan1. species conservation1.1 species conservation1.1.1 in addition to actions specified in article iii and without prejudice to any obligations they may have under the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites), the parties shall prohibit the use of, and trade in, albatrosses and petrels or their eggs, or any readily recognisable parts or derivatives thereof.1.1.2 except for provisions made for species listed under cites, the parties may grant exemptions to the prohibition in paragraph 1.1.1 according to the circumstances provided for in article iii(3).1.1.3 the parties shall, where they consider it appropriate, co-operate to develop and implement conservation strategies for particular species or groups of species of albatrosses or petrels. the secretariat shall co-ordinate the development, harmonisation and implementation of such conservation strategies.1.2 emergency measuresin the event of a request by the advisory committee for a meeting of parties under the emergency provisions of article ix (7), the parties affected, in co-operation as appropriate with each other and with any others, shall develop and implement emergency measures.1.3 re-establishments and re-establishment schemesthe parties shall take a precautionary approach when re-establishing albatrosses and petrels into parts of their traditional breeding range. in such cases, they shall develop and follow a detailed re-establishment scheme. such schemes shall be based on best scientific evidence and should be publicly available. the parties shall inform the secretariat where possible in advance of all re-establishment schemes.1.4 non-native taxa1.4.1 the parties shall take all feasible action to prevent the introduction to habitats, deliberately or otherwise, of non-native taxa of animals, plants or hybrids or disease-causing organisms that may be detrimental to populations of albatrosses and petrels.1.4.2 the parties shall take measures to the extent feasible to control and, where possible, eradicate non-native taxa of animals or plants, or hybrids thereof, that are, or may be, detrimental to populations of albatrosses or petrels. such measures should satisfy to the extent feasible, humane and environmental considerations.2. habitat conservation and restoration2.1 general principlesso far as is appropriate and necessary, the parties shall take such management action, and introduce such legislative and other controls, as will maintain populations of albatrosses and petrels at, or restore them to, favourable conservation status, and prevent the degradation of habitats.2.2 land-based conservation2.2.1 where feasible, the parties shall give protection to the breeding sites of albatrosses and petrels, using existing mechanisms where available. for all such protected areas, the parties shall endeavour to develop and implement management plans and take other actions which maintain and enhance the conservation status of the species, including inter alia the prevention of habitat degradation, the reduction of disturbance to habitats and the minimisation or elimination of damage by introduced non-native animals, plants, hybrids or disease-causing organisms.2.2.2 the parties shall, wherever possible and relevant, co-operate on habitat protection initiatives, especially to ensure the protection and restoration of as many as possible of the breeding sites of albatrosses and petrels that have unfavourable conservation status.2.2.3 the parties shall individually or collectively ensure that all breeding sites of international importance for albatrosses and petrels are given priority attention.2.3 conservation of marine habitats2.3.1 the parties shall endeavour individually and collectively to manage marine habitats so as to:a) ensure the sustainability of marine living resources that provide food for albatrosses and petrels; andb) avoid pollution that may harm albatrosses and petrels.2.3.2 the parties shall individually or collectively seek to develop management plans for the most important foraging and migratory habitats of albatrosses and petrels. such plans shall seek to minimise risks in accordance with paragraph 2.3.1.2.3.3 the parties shall take special measures individually and collectively to conserve marine areas which they consider critical to the survival and/or restoration of species of albatrosses and petrels which have unfavourable conservation status.3. management of human activities3.1 impact assessmentthe parties shall assess the potential impact on albatrosses and petrels of policies, plans, programmes and projects which they consider likely to affect the conservation of albatrosses and petrels before any decision on whether to adopt such policies, plans, programmes or projects, and shall make the results of these assessments publicly available.3.2 incidental mortality in fisheries3.2.1 the parties shall take appropriate operational, management and other measures to reduce or eliminate the mortality of albatrosses and petrels resulting incidentally from fishing activities. where possible, the measures applied should follow best current practice.3.2.2 in relation to fishing activities under the auspices of a regional fisheries organisation, or other organisations managing marine living resources more generally, such as the commission of ccamlr, the parties shall consider information and evaluations from that organisation, and shall adopt, in its area of competence, the measures agreed by that organisation for reducing the incidental taking of albatrosses and petrels. notwithstanding this, and in conformity with the provisions of article xiii (3), the parties may implement measures, that are more strict than those measures, when such measures are within their competency, taking account of the provisions of article i (3).3.2.3 the parties which are also parties to other relevant treaties (such as ccamlr), or members of relevant international organisations (such as fao), shall encourage the institutions of, and other parties to, or members of, such treaties or organisations, to give effect to the objective of this agreement.3.2.4 the parties shall endeavour, within the context of this agreement, to adopt additional measures to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities that may have an adverse effect on albatrosses and petrels.3.3 pollutants and marine debris3.3.1 the parties shall take appropriate measures, within environmental conventions and by other means, to minimise the discharge from land-based sources and from vessels, of pollutants which may have an adverse effect on albatrosses and petrels either on land or at sea.3.3.2 the parties shall seek to manage, in ways that are consistent with the aims of this agreement, mineral exploration and exploitation in waters under their jurisdiction which are frequented by albatrosses and petrels.3.4 disturbance3.4.1 in both marine and terrestrial habitats, the parties shall seek to minimise disturbance of albatrosses and petrels, and to establish and maintain some areas that are kept free from disturbance.3.4.2 the parties shall seek to avoid or minimise disturbance caused by, inter alia, tourism, and in particular by controlling the proximity of approach to breeding birds.3.4.3 in permitting access to breeding sites of albatrosses and petrels for purposes of scientific research, particularly where species are of unfavourable conservation status, the parties shall require that such research is designed and carried out so as to avoid unnecessary disturbance to birds, or impact on their habitats.4. research and monitoring4.1 parties shall seek to undertake research and monitoring in order to fulfil the requirements of article iii, both at sea and on land. where appropriate, they shall do so co-operatively, and shall seek to facilitate the development of improved research and monitoring techniques.4.2 the parties shall, through the use of at-sea observers on fishing vessels or through other appropriate methods, collect reliable and, where possible, verifiable data to enable the accurate estimation of the nature and extent of albatross and petrel interactions with fisheries.5. collation of information by the advisory committee5.1 the reports of the advisory committee under article ix (6) c), should as appropriate include:a) assessments and reviews of the status of populations of albatrosses and petrels, including an assessment of population trends of the species, especially those in poorly known areas and of species for which few data are available;b) identification of internationally important breeding sites;c) reviews to characterise, on the basis of the best available evidence, the foraging range (and principal feeding areas within this) and migration routes and patterns, of populations of albatrosses and petrels;d) identification and assessment of known and suspected threats affecting albatrosses and petrels;e) identification of existing and new methods by which these threats may be avoided or mitigated;f) reviews, and updating on a regular basis, of data on the mortality of albatrosses and petrels in, inter alia, commercial, and other relevant fisheries;g) reviews of data on the distribution and seasonality of effort in fisheries which affect albatrosses and petrels;h) reviews of the status at breeding sites of introduced animals, plants and disease-causing organisms known or believed to be detrimental to albatrosses and petrels;i) reviews of the nature of, coverage by, and effectiveness of, protection arrangements for albatrosses and petrels;j) reviews of recent and current research on albatrosses and petrels with relevance to their conservation status;k) lists of authorities, research centres, scientists and non-governmental organisations concerned with albatrosses and petrels;l) a directory of legislation concerning albatrosses and petrels;m) reviews of education and information programmes aimed at conserving albatrosses and petrels; andn) reviews of current taxonomy in relation to albatrosses and petrels.5.2 the advisory committee should identify gaps in information as part of the above reviews, with a view to addressing these in future priorities.6. education and public awareness6.1 the parties shall seek to make information on the conservation status of albatrosses and petrels, the threats facing them, and the activities taken under the agreement, available to the scientific, fishing and conservation communities, as well as to relevant local authorities and other decision-makers, and to neighbouring states.6.2 the parties shall seek to make local communities and the public in general more aware of the status of albatrosses and petrels and the threats facing them.6.3 the parties shall cooperate with each other, the secretariat and others with a view to developing training programmes and exchanging resource materials.6.4 the parties shall, where necessary, arrange for training programmes to ensure that personnel responsible for the implementation of this action plan have adequate knowledge to implement it effectively.7. implementation7.1 the advisory committee shall develop conservation guidelines to assist the parties in the implementation of this action plan. where possible, these guidelines should be consistent with those developed under other international instruments.7.2 the parties shall collaborate with other countries and organisations involved with albatross and petrel research, monitoring and management for the purpose of exchanging knowledge, skills and techniques to ensure more effective implementation of this action plan.7.3 the parties shall urge parties of other relevant international instruments, in particular ccamlr, to recognise as appropriate the objectives of this action plan.7.4 the secretariat shall regularly undertake a review of potential means for providing necessary resources (viz both funds and technical assistance) for the implementation of this action plan, and shall report on this to each ordinary session of the meeting of the parties.7.5 the parties shall, either individually or through the secretariat, draw the attention of any state which is not a party to this agreement to any activity undertaken by its nationals or vessels which affects the implementation of the action plan.[1] new taxonomy
