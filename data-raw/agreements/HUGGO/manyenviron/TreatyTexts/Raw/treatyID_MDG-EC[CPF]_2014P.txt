Guidelines for implementing the electronic reporting system for fishing activities (ERS)

1.   General provisions

i.

All Union fishing vessels must be equipped with an electronic system, hereinafter referred to as an 'ERS', capable of recording and transmitting data on the vessel's fishing activities, hereinafter referred to as 'ERS data', when the vessel is operating in the Malagasy fishing zone.

ii.

An EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS, or whose ERS is not working, shall not be authorised to enter the Malagasy fishing zone in order to engage in fishing activities.

iii.

ERS data shall be transmitted in accordance with the procedures of the vessel's flag State, i.e. they shall firstly be sent to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter: FMC) of the flag State which will make them automatically available to the Malagasy FMC.

iv.

The flag State and Madagascar shall ensure that their FMCs have the necessary IT equipment and software to automatically transmit ERS data in xml format, and shall have a backup procedure in place capable of recording and storing ERS data in a format which will be computer-readable for at least three years.

v.

ERS data must be transmitted using the electronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf of the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).

vi.

The flag State and Madagascar shall each designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact.

a.

ERS correspondents shall be designated for a minimum period of six months.

b.

The FMCs of the flag State and Madagascar shall notify one another of the contact details (name, address, telephone number, fax, e-mail address) of their ERS correspondent, before the supplier starts production of the ERS.

c.

Any changes to the contact details of the ERS correspondent must be notified immediately.

2.   Producing and communicating ERS data

i.

Union fishing vessels shall:

a.

communicate daily the ERS data for each day spent in the Malagasy fishing zone,

b.

record the quantity of each species caught and kept on board as target species or by-catch, or discarded, for each fishing operation;

c.

for each species identified in the fishing authorisation issued by Madagascar, also declare zero catches;

d.

identify each species by its FAO alpha 3 code;

e.

express the quantities in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish;

f.

record by species in the ERS data the quantity transhipped and/or unloaded;

g.

record, in the ERS data, a specific message declaring the quantities held on board of each species specified in the fishing authorisation issued by Madagascar at each entry into (COE) or exit from (COX) the Malagasy fishing zone;

h.

transmit ERS data on a daily basis to the FMC of the flag State, according to the format referred to in point 2 above, by 23:59 UTC at the latest.

ii.

The master is responsible for the accuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent.

iii.

The FMC of the flag State shall send the ERS data automatically and without delay to the Malagasy FMC.

iv.

The Malagasy FMC shall confirm that it has received the ERS data by means of a return message and shall handle all ERS data confidentially.

3.   Failure of the on-board ERS and/or transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State

i.

The flag State shall immediately inform the master and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or their agent, of any technical failure of the ERS installed on board the vessel or any breakdown in transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the FMC of the flag State.

ii.

The flag State shall inform Madagascar of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken.

iii.

In the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS, the master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within ten days. If the vessel makes a call at a port within those ten days, it may only resume fishing activity in the Malagasy fishing zone once its ERS is in perfect working order, unless Madagascar authorises otherwise.

a.

Following a technical failure in its ERS, a fishing vessel may not leave port until its ERS functions again to the satisfaction of the flag State and Madagascar, or

b.

it receives authorisation from the flag State. In the latter case, the flag State shall inform Madagascar of its decision before the vessel leaves.

iv.

Any EU vessels operating in the Malagasy fishing zone with a faulty ERS must transmit all ERS data on a daily basis and by 23:59 UTC at the latest to the FMC of the flag State by any other available means of electronic communication accessible by the Malagasy FMC.

v.

ERS data which could not be made available to Madagascar via the ERS owing to the failure of the system shall be transmitted by the FMC of the flag State to the Malagasy FMC by another mutually agreed form of electronic communication. This alternative transmission shall be considered priority, it being understood that it may not be possible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.

vi.

If the Malagasy FMC does not receive ERS data from a vessel for three consecutive days, Madagascar may instruct a vessel to immediately call at a port of its choosing in order to investigate.

4.   FMC failure - ERS data not received by Malagasy FMC

i.

In the event that ERS data are not received by an FMC, its ERS correspondent shall immediately inform the ERS correspondent for the other FMC, and if necessary they shall work together to resolve the problem.

ii.

Before the ERS becomes operational, the FMC of the flag State and the Malagasy FMC shall mutually agree on the alternative means of electronic communication to be used in order to transmit ERS data in the event of an FMC failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any changes thereto.

iii.

If the Malagasy FMC reports that ERS data has not been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the problem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve the problem. The FMC of the flag State shall inform the Malagasy FMC and the EU of the outcome of the measures taken within 24 hours after recognising the failure.

iv.

If more than 24 hours is required in order to resolve the problem, the FMC of the flag State shall immediately transmit the missing ERS data to the Malagasy FMC via one of the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 5 of paragraph 3.

v.

Madagascar shall inform its competent monitoring services (CMS) so that EU vessels are not considered by the Malagasy FMC to be in violation of their obligations for not transmitting ERS data owing to a failure in one of the FMCs.

5.   FMC maintenance

i.

Planned maintenance of an FMC (maintenance programme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least 72 hours in advance to the other FMC, indicating, where possible, the date and duration of the maintenance work. Information about unplanned maintenance work shall be sent to the other FMC as soon as possible.

ii.
