convention relating to civil liability in the field of maritime carriage of nuclear materialsource: the high contracting parties,considering that the paris convention of 29 july 1960 on third party liability in the field of nuclear energy and its additional protocol of 28 january 1964 (hereinafter referred to as "the paris convention") and the vienna convention of 21 may 1963 on civil liability for nuclear damage (hereinafter referred to as "the vienna convention") provide that, in the case of damage caused by a nuclear incident occurring in the course of maritime carriage of nuclear material covered by such conventions, the operator of a nuclear installation is the person liable for such damage,considering that similar provisions exist in the national law in force in certain states,considering that the application of any preceding international convention in the field of maritime transport is however maintained,desirous of ensuring that the operator of a nuclear installation will be exclusively liable for damage caused by a nuclear incident occurring in the course of maritime carriage of nuclear material,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1any person who by virtue of an international convention or national law applicable in the field of maritime transport might be held liable for damage caused by a nuclear incident shall be exonerated from such liability:(a) if the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such damage under either the paris or the vienna convention, or(b) if the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for such damage by virtue of a national law governing the liability for such damage, provided that such law is in all respects as favourable to persons who may suffer damage as either the paris or the vienna convention ARTICLE 21. the exoneration provided for in article 1 shall also apply in respect of damage caused by a nuclear incident:(a) to the nuclear installation itself or to any property on the site of that installation which is used or to be used in connexion with that installation, or(b) to the means of transport upon which the nuclear material involved was at the time of the nuclear incident, for which the operator of the nuclear installation is not liable because his liability for such damage has been excluded pursuant to the provisions of either the paris or the vienna convention, or, in cases referred to in article 1(b), by equivalent provisions of the national law referred to therein.2. the provisions of paragraph 1 shall not, however, affect the liability of any
