NOTE I.

Copenhagen, 21 November 1986
Sir,
In accordance with rule 7 of annex VI
to the Convention on the Protection of
the Marine Environment of the Baltic
Sea Area, the Contracting Parties shall
reach agreement as soon as possible con
cerning the regions of the Baltic Sea area
within which they shall take steps to
combat or remedy pollution caused by
oil or other harmful substances and the
like (areas of responsibility). In that con
nection, I wish to propose the following
arrangement with regard to the marine
areas between Sweden and Denmark
which lie within the area of applicability
of the Convention on the Marine Envi
ronment of the Baltic Sea Area.
From a point with co-ordinates 57&#186; 44'
48.0" N, 11 &#186; 06' 59.2" O the boundary be
tween the areas of responsibility shall
coincide with the boundary of the conti
nental shelves and the fishery zones be
tween Sweden and Denmark which were
agreed upon in the Agreement of 9 No
vember 1984, or subsequent amend
ments thereto. The above co-ordinates
represent the point on the straight line
between points C and D in the aforemen
tioned Agreement where the line inter-
sects the parallel of latitude 57&#186; 44'
  48.0" N, which, according to article 1 of
the Convention on the Protection of the
Marine Environment, constitutes the
line of demarcation for the area of appli
cability of the Convention.
If the Government of Denmark agrees
with the Government of Sweden concern
ing the foregoing, I wish to propose that
this note and your confirmatory reply
should constitute an Agreement between
pur two Governments which shall enter
into force 30 days after the date on which
I receive your confirmatory reply.
Accept, Sir, etc.
