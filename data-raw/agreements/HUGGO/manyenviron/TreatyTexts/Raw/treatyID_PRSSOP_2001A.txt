and (b) "polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins" and "polychlorinated dibenzofurans" are tricyclic, aromatic compounds formed by two benzene rings connected by two oxygen atoms in polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and by one oxygen atom and one carbon-carbon bond in polychlorinated dibenzofurans and the hydrogen atoms of which may be replaced by up to eight chlorine atoms.2. in this annex, the toxicity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans is expressed using the concept of toxic equivalency which measures the relative dioxin-like toxic activity of different congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in comparison to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. the toxic equivalent factor values to be used for the purposes of this convention shall be consistent with accepted international standards, commencing with the world health organization 1998 mammalian toxic equivalent factor values for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls. concentrations are expressed in toxic equivalents.part v: general guidance on best available techniques and best environmental practices this part provides general guidance to parties on preventing or reducing releases of the chemicals listed in part i.a. general prevention measures relating to both best available techniques and best environmental practices priority should be given to the consideration of approaches to prevent the formation and release of the chemicals listed in part i. useful measures could include: (a) the use of low-waste technology; (b) the use of less hazardous substances; (c) the promotion of the recovery and recycling of waste and of substances generated and used in a process; (d) replacement of feed materials which are persistent organic pollutants or where there is a direct link between the materials and releases of persistent organic pollutants from the source; (e) good housekeeping and preventive maintenance programmes; (f) improvements in waste management with the aim of the cessation of open and other uncontrolled burning of wastes, including the burning of landfill sites. when considering proposals to construct new waste disposal facilities, consideration should be given to alternatives such as activities to minimize the generation of municipal and medical waste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation and promoting products that generate less waste. under this approach, public health concerns should be carefully considered;(g) minimization of these chemicals as contaminants in products; (h) avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for bleaching. b. best available techniques the concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions. appropriate control techniques to reduce releases of the chemicals listed in part i are in general the same. in determining best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the following factors, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and consideration of precaution and prevention:(a) general considerations: (i) the nature, effects and mass of the releases concerned: techniques may vary depending on source size;(ii) the commissioning dates for new or existing installations; (iii) the time needed to introduce the best available technique; (iv) the consumption and nature of raw materials used in the process and its energy efficiency;(v) the need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the releases to the environment and the risks to it; (vi) the need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment; (vii) the need to ensure occupational health and safety at workplaces; (viii) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale;(ix) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding. (b) general release reduction measures: when considering proposals to construct new facilities or significantly modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals listed in this annex, priority consideration should be given to alternative processes, techniques or practices that have similar usefulness but which avoid the formation and release of such chemicals. in cases where such facilities will be constructed or significantly modified, in addition to the prevention measures outlined in section a of part v the following reduction measures could also be considered in determining best available techniques: (i) use of improved methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic oxidation, dust precipitation, or adsorption; (ii) treatment of residuals, wastewater, wastes and sewage sludge by, for example, thermal treatment or rendering them inert or chemical processes that detoxify them; (iii) process changes that lead to the reduction or elimination of releases, such as moving to closed systems; (iv) modification of process designs to improve combustion and prevent formation of the chemicals listed in this annex, through the control of parameters such as incineration temperature or residence time.c. best environmental practices the conference of the parties may develop guidance with regard to best environmental practices. ANNEX d information requirements and screening criteria 1. a party submitting a proposal to list a chemical in annexes a, b and/ or c shall identify the chemical in the manner described in subparagraph (a) and provide the information on the chemical, and its transformation products where relevant, relating to the screening criteria set out in subparagraphs (b) to (e): (a) chemical identity: (i) names, including trade name or names, commercial name or names and synonyms, chemical abstracts service (cas) registry number, international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac) name; and (ii) structure, including specification of isomers, where applicable, and the structure of the chemical class;(b) persistence: (i) evidence that the half-life of the chemical in water is greater than two months, or that its half-life in soil is greater than six months, or that its half-life in sediment is greater than six months; or (ii) evidence that the chemical is otherwise sufficiently persistent to justify its consideration within the scope of this convention;(c) bio-accumulation:(i) evidence that the bio-concentration factor or bio-accumulation factor in aquatic species for the chemical is greater than 5,000 or, in the absence of such data, that the log kow is greater than 5; (ii) evidence that a chemical presents other reasons for concern, such as high bio-accumulation in other species, high toxicity or ecotoxicity; or(iii) monitoring data in biota indicating that the bio-accumulation potential of the chemical is sufficient to justify its consideration within the scope of this convention; (d) potential for long-range environmental transport: (i) measured levels of the chemical in locations distant from the sources of its release that are of potential concern;(ii) monitoring data showing that long-range environmental transport of the chemical, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment, may have occurred via air, water or migratory species; or (iii) environmental fate properties and/ or model results that demonstrate that the chemical has a potential for long-range environmental transport through air, water or migratory species, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment in locations distant from the sources of its release. for a chemical that migrates significantly through the air, its half-life in air should be greater than two days; and (e) adverse effects: (i) evidence of adverse effects to human health or to the environment that justifies consideration of the chemical within the scope of this convention; or(ii) toxicity or ecotoxicity data that indicate the potential for damage to human health or to the environment. 2. the proposing party shall provide a statement of the reasons for concern including, where possible, a comparison of toxicity or ecotoxicity data with detected or predicted levels of a chemical resulting or anticipated from its long-range environmental transport, and a short statement indicating the need for global control.3. the proposing party shall, to the extent possible and taking into account its capabilities, provide additional information to support the review of the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of article 8. in developing such a proposal, a party may draw on technical expertise from any source. ANNEX e information requirements for the risk profile the purpose of the review is to evaluate whether the chemical is likely, as a result of its long-range environmental transport, to lead to significant adverse human health and/ or environmental effects, such that global action is warranted. for this purpose, a risk profile shall be developed that further elaborates on, and evaluates, the information referred to in annex d and includes, as far as possible, the following types of information: (a) sources, including as appropriate: (i) production data, including quantity and location; (ii) uses; and (iii) releases, such as discharges, losses and emissions; (b) hazard assessment for the endpoint or endpoints of concern, including a consideration of toxicological interactions involving multiple chemicals;(c) environmental fate, including data and information on the chemical and physical properties of a chemical as well as its persistence and how they are linked to its environmental transport, transfer within and between environmental compartments, degradation and transformation to other chemicals. a determination of the bio-concentration factor or bio-accumulation factor, based on measured values, shall be available, except when monitoring data are judged to meet this need; (d) monitoring data; (e) exposure in local areas and, in particular, as a result of long-range environmental transport, and including information regarding bio-availability;(f) national and international risk evaluations, assessments or profiles and labelling information and hazard classifications, as available; and (g) status of the chemical under international conventions. ANNEX f information on socio-economic considerations an evaluation should be undertaken regarding possible control measures for chemicals under consideration for inclusion in this convention, encompassing the full range of options, including management and elimination. for this purpose, relevant information should be provided relating to socio-economic considerations associated with possible control measures to enable a decision to be taken by the conference of the parties. such information should reflect due regard for the differing capabilities and conditions among the parties and should include consideration of the following indicative list of items:(a) efficacy and efficiency of possible control measures in meeting risk reduction goals: (i) technical feasibility; and (ii) costs, including environmental and health costs;(b) alternatives (products and processes): (i) technical feasibility; (ii) costs, including environmental and health costs; (iii) efficacy; (iv) risk; (v) availability; and (vi) accessibility;(c) positive and/ or negative impacts on society of implementing possible control measures: (i) health, including public, environmental and occupational health; (ii) agriculture, including aquaculture and forestry; (iii) biota (biodiversity); (iv) economic aspects; (v) movement towards sustainable development; and (vi) social costs;(d) waste and disposal implications (in particular, obsolete stocks of pesticides and clean-up of contaminated sites):(i) technical feasibility; and (ii) cost;(e) access to information and public education; (f) status of control and monitoring capacity; and (g) any national or regional control actions taken, including information on alternatives, and other relevant risk management information.
