the purposes of this annex:(1) "chemical tanker" means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry a cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk and includes an "oil tanker" as defined in annex i of the present convention when carrying a cargo or part cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk.(2) "clean ballast" means ballast carried in a tank which, since it was last used to carry a cargo containing a substance in category a, b, c or d has been thoroughly cleaned and the residues resulting therefrom have been discharged and the tank emptied in accordance with the appropriate requirements of this annex.(3) "segregated ballast" means ballast water introduced into a tank permanently allocated to the carriage of ballast or to the carriage of ballast or cargoes other than oil or noxious liquid substances as variously defined in the annexes of the present convention, and which is completely separated from the cargo and oil fuel system.(4) "nearest land" is as defined in regulation 1(9) of annex i of the present convention.(5) "liquid substances" are those having a vapour pressure not exceeding 2.8 kp/cm2 at a temperature of 37.8°c.(6) "noxious liquid substance" means any substance designated in appendix ii to this annex or provisionally assessed under the provisions of regulation 3(4) as falling into category a, b, c or d.(7) "special area" means a sea area where for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanographic and ecological condition and to its peculiar transportation traffic the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of sea pollution by noxious liquid substances is required.special areas shall be:(a) the baltic sea area, and(b) the black sea area.(8) "baltic sea area" is as defined in regulation l0(l)(b) of annex i of the present convention.(9) "black sea area" is as defined in regulation 10(1)(c) of annex i of the present convention.regulation 2 application(1) unless expressly provided otherwise the provisions of this annex shall apply to all ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk.(2) where a cargo subject to the provisions of annex i of the present convention is carried in a cargo space of a chemical tanker, the appropriate requirements of annex i of the present convention shall also apply.(3) regulation 13 of this annex shall apply only to ships carrying substances which are categorized for discharge control purposes in category a, b or c.regulation 3categorization and listing of noxious liquid substances(1) for the purpose of the regulations of this annex, except regulation 13, noxious liquid substances shall be divided into four categories as follows:(a) category a - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause serious harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify the application of stringent anti-pollution measures.(b) category b - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify the application of special anti-pollution measures.(c) category c - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a minor hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause minor harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore require special operational conditions.(d) category d - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a recognizable hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause minimal harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore require some attention in operational conditions.(2) guidelines for use in the categorization of noxious liquid substances are given in appendix ito this annex.(3) the list of noxious liquid substances carried in bulk and presently categorized which are subject to the provisions of this annex is set out in appendix ii to this annex.(4) where it is proposed to carry a liquid substance in bulk which has not been categorized under paragraph (1) of this regulation or evaluated as referred to in regulation 4(1) of this annex, the governments of parties to the convention involved in the proposed operation shall establish and agree on a provisional assessment for the proposed operation on the basis of the guidelines referred to in paragraph (2) of this regulation. until full agreement between the governments involved has been reached, the substance shall be carried under the most severe conditions proposed. as soon as possible, but not later than ninety days after its first carriage, the administration concerned shall notify the organization and provide details of the substance and the provisional assessment for prompt circulation to all parties for their information and consideration. the government of each party shall have a period of ninety days in which to forward its comments to the organization, with a view to the assessment of the substance.regulation 4other liquid substances(1) the substances listed in appendix iii to this annex have been evaluated and found to fall outside the categories a, b, c and d, as defined in regulation 3(1) of this annex because they are presently considered to present no

procedures to an appendix to an annex APPENDIX iguidelines for the categorization ofnoxious liquid substancescategory a substances which are bioaccumulated and liable to produce a hazard to aquatic life or human health; or which are highly toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a hazard rating 4, defined by a tlm less than 1 ppm); and additionally certain substances which are moderately toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a hazard rating 3, defined by a tlm of 1 or more, but less than 10 ppm) when particular weight is given to additional factors in the hazard profile or to special characteristics of the substance.category b substances which are bioaccumulated with a short retention of the order of one week or less; or which are liable to produce tainting of the sea food; or which are moderately toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a hazard rating 3, defined by a tlm of 1 ppm or more, but less than 10 ppm); and additionally certain substances which are slightly toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a hazard rating 2, defined by a tlm of 10 ppm or more, but less than 100 ppm) when particular weight is given to additional factors in the hazard profile or to special characteristics of the substance.category c substances which are slightly toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a hazard rating 2, defined by a tlm of 10 or more, but less than 100 ppm); and additionally certain substances which are practically non-toxic to aquatic life (as expressed by a hazard rating 1, defined by a tlm of 100 ppm or more, but less than 1,000 ppm) when particular weight is given to additional factors in the hazard profile or to special characteristics of the substance.category d substances which are practically non-toxic to aquatic life, (as expressed by a hazard rating 1, defined by a tlm of 100 ppm or more, but less than 1,000 ppm); or causing deposits blanketing the seafloor with a high biochemical oxygen demand (bod); or highly hazardous to human health, with an ld50 of less than 5 mg/kg; or produce moderate reduction of amenities because of persistency, smell or poisonous or irritant characteristics, possibly interfering with use of beaches; or moderately hazardous to human health, with an ld50 of 5 mg/kg or more, but less than 50 mg/kg and produce slight reduction of amenities.other liquid substances (for the purposes of regulation 4 of
