convention on cooperation for the protection and sustainable use of the danube river (danube river protection convention)source: preamblethe contracting parties,determined by the strong intention to intensify their water management cooperation in the field of water protection and water use;concerned over the occurrence and threats of adverse effects, in the short or long term, of changes in conditions of watercourses within the danube river basin on the environment, economies and well-being of the danubian states;emphasizing the urgent need for strengthened domestic and international measures to prevent, control and reduce significant adverse transboundary impact from the release of hazardous substances and of nutrients into the aquatic environment within the danube basin with due attention also given to the black sea;commending the measures already taken on the domestic initiative of danubian countries and on the bilateral and multilateral level of their cooperation as well as the efforts already undertaken within the csce process, by the united nations economic commission for europe and by the european community to promote the cooperation, in bilateral and multilateral levels, for the prevention and control transboundary pollution, sustainable water management, rational use and conservation of water resources;referring in particular to the convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes of 17 march 1992 as well as the existing bi-and multilateral cooperation among danubian states, which will be continued and duly taken into account by the cooperation of all danubian states, as well as pointing to the convention on the protection of the black sea against pollution of 21 april 1992;striving at a lasting improvement and protection of danube river and of the waters within its catchment area in particular in the transboundary context and at sustainable water management taking duly into account the interests of the danubian states in the field of water use and at the same time contributing to the protection of the marine environment of the black sea;have agreed as follows:part igeneral provisions ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of this convention:(a) "danubian states" mean sovereign states sharing a considerable part of the hydrological catchment area of the danube river. as considerable part there is assumed a share exceeding 2.000 km 2 of the total hydrological catchment area.(b) "catchmentarea" of the danube river means the hydrological river basin as far as it is shared by the contracting parties.(c) "transboundary impact " means any significant adverse effect on the riverine environment resulting from a change in the conditions of waters caused by human activity and stretching out beyond an area under the jurisdiction of a contracting party. such changes may affect life and property, safety of facilities and the aquatic ecosystems concerned.(d) "hazardous substances" means substances which have toxic, cancerogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic or bioaccumulative effects, in particular those being persistent and having significant adverse impact on living organisms.(e) "substances hazardous to water " means substances the hazard potential of which to water resources is extraordinarily high so that their handling requires special preventive and protective measures;(f) "point and non-point sources of water pollution" means the sources of pollutants and nutrients the input of which to waters is caused either by locally determined discharges (point source) or by diffuse effects being widespread over the catchment areas (non-point sources);(g) "water balance" means the relationship characterising the natural water household of an entire

competent authorities surveille, that activities likely to cause transboundary impacts are carried out in compliance with the permits and provisions imposed;(f) environmental impact assessment in line with supranational and international regulations or other procedures for evaluation and assessment of environmental effects are applied;(g) when planning, licensing and implementing activities and measures as referred to in article 3, paragraph 2 and in article 16, paragraph 2 the competent authorities take into account risks of accidents involving substances hazardous to water by imposing preventive measures and by ordering rules of conduct for post accident response measures ARTICLE 8emission inventories, action programmes and progress reviews(1) the contracting parties shall undertake periodically inventories of the relevant point and non-point sources of pollution within the catchment area of danube river including the prevention and abatement measures already taken for the respective discharges as well as on the actual efficiency of these measures, taking duly into account article 5, paragraph 2, subpara a.(2) based on that the contracting parties shall in stages

this aim, they shall- harmonise or make comparable their monitoring and assessment methods as applied on their domestic levels, in particular in the field of river quality, emission control, flood forecast and water balance, with a view to achieving comparable results to be introduced into the joint monitoring and assessment activities;- develop concerted or joint monitoring systems applying stationary or mobile measurement devices, communication and data processing facilities;- elaborate and implement joint programmes for monitoring the riverine conditions in the danube catchment area concerning both water quality and quantity, sediments and riverine ecosystems, as a basis for the assessment of transboundary impacts such as transboundary pollution and changes of the riverine regimes as well as of water balances, floods and ice-hazards;- develop joint or harmonised methods for monitoring and assessment of waste water discharges including processing, evaluation and documentation of data taking into account the branch-specific approach of emission limitation (annex ii, part 1);- elaborate inventories on relevant point sources including the pollutants discharged (emission inventories) and estimate the water pollution from non-point sources taking into account annex ii, part 2; review these documents according to the actual state.(2) in particular they shall

the undersigned being duly authorised by their respective governments, have signed the convention on cooperation for the protection and sustainable use of the danube river (danube river protection convention).done at sofia on the 29 th day of june 1994 ANNEX ipart ibest available techniques1. the use of the best available techniques shall emphasize the use of non-waste technology, if available.2. the term "best available techniques" means the latest stage of development (state of the art) of processes, of facilities or of methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste. in determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of operation constitute the best available techniques in general of individual cases, special consideration shall be given to:(a) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation, which have recently been successfully tried out;(b) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(c) the economic feasibility of such techniques;(d) time limits for installation in both new and existing plants;(e) the nature and volume of the discharges and emissions concerned.3. it therefore follows that what is "best available techniques" for a particular process will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.4. if the reduction of discharges and emissions resulting from the use of best available techniques does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.5. the term "techniques" includes both the technology used and the way the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and dismantled.part 2best environmental practice1. best environmental practice means the application of the most appropriate combination of sectoral environmental control strategies and measures.2. in determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practice, in general or individual cases, particular consideration should be given to: -the precautionary principle;-the environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ultimate disposal (principle of responsibility);-the substitution by less polluting activities or substances and saving resources including energy (principle of minimising);-the scale of use;-the potential environmental benefit or penalty to substitute materials or activities;-advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;-time limits for implementation;-social and economic implication.3. it therefore follows that best environmental practice for
