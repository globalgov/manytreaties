The contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life assurance and sickness and accident insurance.

4.

The shipowner or his representative shall send a copy of the contract to the Department via the Delegation, as soon as the competent authorities of the Member State concerned have endorsed the contract.

5.

The shipowner or agent shall inform the Department, via the Delegation, of the names of the Moroccan seamen taken on board each vessel, mentioning their position in the crew.

6.

The Delegation shall send the Department, on 1 February and 1 August, a half-yearly summary of the Moroccan seamen taken on board each EU vessel, with details of their registration.

7.

The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen taken on board EU fishing vessels. This concerns in particular freedom of association, effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

8.

Moroccan seamen's wages shall be paid by the shipowners. They shall be fixed, before licences are issued, by mutual agreement between the shipowners or their agents and the Moroccan seamen concerned or their representatives. However, the wage conditions granted to Moroccan seamen shall not be lower than those applied to Moroccan crews and shall comply with ILO standards and under no circumstances be below those standards.

9.

If one or more seamen employed on board fail to report at the time agreed for the vessel's departure, the vessel shall be permitted to start the planned trip after informing the competent authorities in the port of embarkation of the shortfall in the number of seamen required and having updated its crew list. These authorities shall inform the Department thereof.

10.

The shipowner shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the number of seamen required by this Agreement are signed on by the vessel by the next trip at the latest.

11.

Where an EU vessel fails to take on board Moroccan seamen for reasons other than that specified in the previous point, the owner of the vessel concerned shall be obliged to pay, within a maximum of three months, a flat-rate amount of EUR 20 per Moroccan seaman not taken on board and per day of fishing in the Moroccan fishing zone.

12.

This sum shall be used for training Moroccan fishermen and shall be paid into bank account number 0018100078000 20110750201 at Bank Al Maghrib, Morocco.

13.

Except as provided for in point 9, repeated failure by shipowners to embark the requisite number of Moroccan seamen shall result in automatic suspension of the vessels' fishing licence until such obligations have been met. The Delegation shall be informed without delay of any such decision.

CHAPTER VIII

MONITORING AND OBSERVATION OF FISHING

A.   Observation of fishing

1.

Vessels authorised to fish in the Moroccan fishing zone under this Protocol shall take on board the observers appointed by Morocco on the terms set out below.

1.1.

Each quarter, 25 % of authorised vessels with a tonnage of more than 100 GT shall take on board observers.

1.2.

Industrial pelagic fishing vessels shall take a scientific observer on board for the entire period of activity in the Moroccan fishing zone.

1.3.

Other EU fishing vessels with a tonnage less than or equal to 100 GT shall be observed during a maximum of ten voyages per year and per category of fishing.

1.4.

The Department shall draw up a list of vessels designated to take an observer on board and a list of appointed observers. These lists shall be sent to the Delegation as soon as they have been drawn up.

1.5.

The Department shall inform the shipowners concerned, through the Delegation, of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board their vessel at the time the licence is issued, or no later than 15 days before the observer's planned embarkation date.

2.

Observers shall remain on board pelagic trawlers on a permanent basis. For the other categories of fishing, observers shall spend at one voyage per vessel on board.

3.

The conditions under which the observer is taken on board shall be agreed between the shipowner or its agent and the Moroccan authorities.

4.

The observer shall be taken on board at a port chosen by the shipowner at the beginning of the first trip in the Moroccan fishing zone after notification of the list of designated ships.

5.

The shipowner shall provide notification of the dates and ports in Morocco where the observer will be taken on board, no later than two weeks before the planned embarkation.

6.

Where the observer is taken on board in a foreign country, their travel costs shall be borne by the vessel owner. Should a vessel with a Moroccan observer on board leave the Moroccan fishing zone, all measures must be taken to ensure the observer's return to Morocco as soon as possible at the shipowner's expense.

7.

In the event of a wasted journey by the observer, caused by a failure by the shipowner to comply with its commitments, the shipowner shall pay the observer's travel expenses and daily allowances, equal to those received by Moroccan national officials of an equivalent grade, for each day of inactivity. Similarly, in the event of a delay in embarkation which is due to the shipowner, the shipowner shall pay the observer the daily allowances described above.

Any amendment to the rules and regulations concerning daily allowances shall be notified to the Delegation no later than two months before its entry into force.

8.

If the observer is not present at the time and place agreed and during the 12 hours following the time agreed, the shipowner shall be automatically absolved of his duty to take the observer on board.

9.

Observers shall be treated on board as officers. They shall carry out the following tasks:

9.1.

observe the fishing activities of the vessels;

9.2.

verify the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations;

9.3.

perform biological sampling in the context of scientific programmes;

9.4.

note the fishing gear used;

9.5.

verify the catch data for the Moroccan fishing zone recorded in the logbook;

9.6.

verify the percentages of by-catches and estimate the quantity of discards of species of marketable fin-fish, crustaceans and cephalopods;

9.7.

report fishing data by fax or by radio, including the quantity of catches and by-catches on board.

10.

The master shall do everything in their power to ensure the physical safety and welfare of the observer during the performance of their duties.

11.

The observer shall be offered every facility needed to carry out their duties. The master shall facilitate their access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of their duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel's fishing activities, in particular the logbook and the navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the exercise of their tasks as observer.

12.

While on board, the observer shall:

1.

take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of their boarding and presence on the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations,

2.

take care of the material and equipment on board and respect the confidentiality of all documents belonging to the vessel.

13.

At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel, the observer shall draw up an activity report to be transmitted to the competent authorities in Morocco, with a copy to the Delegation. He/she shall sign it in the presence of the master, who may add or cause to be added to it any observations considered relevant, followed by the master's signature. A copy of the report shall be handed to the master when the observer is put ashore.

14.

The shipowner shall bear the cost of accommodating the observer in the same conditions as the officers on the vessel, within the confines of the structure of the vessel.

15.

The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by the competent Moroccan authorities.

16.

In order to reimburse Morocco for the costs arising from the presence of observers on board vessels, in addition to the fee payable by shipowners, provision is also made for the 'observers' expenses' to be paid, calculated on the basis of EUR 5,5 per GT per quarter and per vessel fishing in the Moroccan fishing zone.

These costs shall be paid in accordance with the payment terms set out in Chapter I, Section E of this Annex.

17.

Failure by the shipowner to comply with the obligations laid down in point 4 shall entail automatic suspension of the fishing licence until such obligations have been met. The Delegation shall be informed without delay of any such decision.

B.   Joint monitoring of fishing

1.

The contracting parties shall set up a system of joint monitoring and observation of checks on landings, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of such checks so as to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Protocol.

2.

The parties shall prepare an annual schedule for joint monitoring, covering all fishing categories provided for in this Protocol.

3.

To this end, the competent authorities of each contracting party shall designate a representative to attend checks on landings and observe the arrangements for conducting such checks, notifying their name to the other contracting party.

4.

The representative of the Moroccan authority shall attend, as an observer, inspections on landings by vessels which have operated in the Moroccan fishing zone carried out by the national inspection authorities of the Member States.

5.

The representative shall accompany national inspection officials in their visits to ports, on board vessels, in dock, to auctions, fish wholesalers' shops, coldstores and other premises for landing fish before it is placed on the market, and shall have access to the documents which are the subject of these inspections.

6.

The representative of the Moroccan authority shall draw up and submit a report detailing the inspections attended. A copy of the report shall be sent to the Delegation.

7.

The Department shall invite the Delegation to attend inspection visits scheduled in the ports of landing, giving one month's notice.

8.

At the Commission's request, EU fishing inspectors may attend as observers inspections carried out by the Moroccan authorities on landing operations by EU vessels in Moroccan ports.

9.

The practical arrangements for these operations will be laid down by mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the two parties.

CHAPTER IX

MONITORING

1.   Technical inspection

1.1.

Once a year and after any change to their technical characteristics or following a request for a change in fishing category necessitating the use of a different type of fishing gear, EU vessels holding a licence under this Protocol shall report to a Moroccan port to undergo the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections shall take place within 48 hours of the vessel's arrival in port.

1.2.

Once the inspection has been completed satisfactorily, the master of the vessel shall be issued with a certificate having the same period of validity as the licence, and which shall be automatically extended in the case of vessels renewing their licence within the year. However, the maximum validity may not exceed one year. This certificate must be kept on board at all times.

1.3.

The purpose of the technical inspection is to establish the compliance of the vessel's technical characteristics and gear, to check the operation of the satellite tracking and positioning device installed on board and ensure that the provisions relating to its Moroccan crew have been complied with.

1.4.

The cost of the inspection shall be borne by the shipowner at the rates laid down by Moroccan law. It may not be greater than the amount normally paid by other vessels for the same services.

1.5.

Failure by the shipowner to comply with points 1.1 and 1.2 above shall result in automatic suspension of the fishing licence until such obligations have been met. The Delegation shall be informed without delay of any such decision.

2.   Entering and leaving the zone

2.1.

EU vessels holding a licence under this Protocol shall notify the Department, at least six hours in advance, of their intention to enter or leave the Moroccan fishing zone, together with the following information:

2.1.1.

date and time of transmission;

2.1.2.

the vessel's position, in accordance with point 5 of Chapter V;

2.1.3.

the weight in kilograms and catches per species on board, as identified using the 3-alpha code;

2.1.4.

messages such as 'catches on entry' (COE) and 'catches on exit' (COX).

2.2.

This information should preferably be communicated by fax or, for vessels not equipped with a fax, by radio (in this respect, see the information provided in Appendix 10).

2.3.

In the case of vessels falling under the category 'industrial pelagic fishing', the final exit from the Moroccan fishing zone shall be subject to the Department's prior authorisation. This authorisation shall be issued within 24 hours of the request being made by the ship's master or agent, with the exception of a request arriving on the day before a weekend where the authorisation has to be issued on the following Monday. If authorisation is withheld, the Department shall notify the owner of the vessel and the Commission without delay of the reasons for such refusal.

2.4.

A vessel found to be fishing without having informed the Department shall be regarded as a vessel without a licence.

2.5.

The fax and telephone numbers of the vessel and the master's e-mail address are to be indicated by the owner on the fishing licence application form.

3.   Monitoring procedures

3.1.

Masters of EU fishing vessels holding a licence under this Protocol shall allow and facilitate boarding and the discharge of their duties by any Moroccan official responsible for the inspection and monitoring of fishing activities.

3.2.

These officials shall not remain on board for longer than is necessary for the discharge of their duties.

3.3.

Once the inspection and monitoring has been completed, a certificate shall be issued to the master of the vessel.

4.   Boarding

4.1.

The Department shall inform the Delegation as soon as possible and within no more than 48 hours of all boardings of and penalties imposed on EU vessels in the Moroccan fishing zone.

4.2.

The Commission shall at the same time receive a brief report of the circumstances and reasons leading to the boarding.

5.   Statement of boarding

5.1.

After the Moroccan authorities responsible for inspection have drawn up a statement, the master of the vessel shall sign it.

5.2.

This signature shall not prejudice the master's rights or any defence which he or she may make to the alleged infringement.

5.3.

The master shall take the vessel to the port indicated by the Moroccan authorities responsible for inspection. A vessel in breach of the applicable Moroccan sea fishing legislation shall be kept in port until completion of the usual administrative formalities relating to boarding.

6.   Settlement of infringements:

6.1.

Before any judicial procedure, an attempt shall be made to resolve the presumed infringement by means of an amicable settlement. This procedure shall end no later than three working days after the boarding.

6.2.

In the event of an amicable settlement, the amount of the fine shall be determined in accordance with Moroccan fisheries legislation.

6.3.

If the case cannot be settled by amicable procedure and has to be brought before a competent judicial body, a bank security set to take account of the boarding costs and the fines and compensation payable by the parties responsible for the infringement shall be paid by the shipowner into a bank account specified by the competent Moroccan authority.

6.4.

The bank security shall be irrevocable until the legal proceedings have been concluded. It shall be released once legal proceedings end without a conviction. Similarly, in the event of a conviction leading to a fine of less than the security lodged, the balance shall be released by the competent Moroccan authorities.

6.5.

The vessel shall be authorised to leave the port:

-

once the obligations arising under the amicable settlement have been fulfilled; or

-

when the bank security referred to in point 6.3 above has been lodged and accepted by the competent Moroccan authority, pending completion of the legal proceedings.

7.   Transhipment

7.1.

Any transhipment at sea of catches shall be prohibited in the Moroccan fishing zone. However, EU industrial pelagic trawlers that have been granted a licence in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol and wish to tranship catches in Moroccan waters may do so in a Moroccan port or other place designated by the competent Moroccan authorities, after authorisation by the Department. Such transhipment shall take place under the supervision of the observer or of a representative of the maritime fisheries delegation and the control authorities. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the penalties provided for by Moroccan law.

7.2.

Before any transhipment, the owners of these vessels must notify the following information to the Department at least 24 hours in advance:

-

the names of the transhipping fishing vessels;

-

the name of the cargo vessel, its flag, registration number and call sign;

-

the tonnage by species to be transhipped;

-

the destination of catches;

-

the date and day of transhipment.

7.3.

Morocco reserves the right to refuse transhipment if the carrier vessel has carried out illegal, undeclared or unregulated fishing inside or outside the Moroccan fishing zone.

7.4.

Transhipment shall be considered as an exit from the Moroccan fishing zone. Vessels must therefore submit their catch declarations to the Department and state whether they intend to continue fishing or leave the Moroccan fishing zone.

7.5.

Masters of EU industrial pelagic trawlers that have been granted a licence in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol engaged in landing or transhipment operations in a Moroccan port shall allow and facilitate the inspection of such operations by Moroccan inspectors. Once the inspection and control have been completed in the port, a certificate shall be issued to the master of the vessel.

CHAPTER X

LANDING OF CATCHES

The contracting parties, aware of the interest of increased integration with a view to ensuring the joint development of their respective fisheries sectors, agree to adopt the following measures concerning the landing in Moroccan ports of a proportion of catches made in the Moroccan fishing zone by EU vessels which have been granted a licence in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol.

The proportion of the catch subject to compulsory landing shall be in accordance with the provisions laid down in the datasheets annexed to this Protocol.

Financial incentives:

1.

Landings

EU tuna vessels and RSW (refrigerated sea water) vessels operating on C stocks of small pelagic stocks) which have been granted a licence in accordance with this Protocol and which land, in a Moroccan port, more than the compulsory landings of 25 % provided for in datasheets 5 and 6, shall benefit from a 5 % reduction in the fee for each tonne landed above the compulsory threshold.

2.

Implementation rules

During landing operations, fish markets will draw up a weighing slip acting as the basis for product traceability.

A 'statement of sales and deductions' shall be drawn up for sales in fish markets.

Copies of the above weighing slips and statements shall be sent to the Delegation in the port of landing. Once they have been approved by the Department, the shipowners concerned shall be informed of the amounts that will be refunded to them. These amounts shall be deducted from the fees due for future licence applications.

3.

Evaluation

The level of the financial incentives shall be adjusted within the Joint Committee taking into account the socioeconomic impact of landings.

4.

Penalties in the event of non-compliance with the applicable landing requirements.

Vessels in the categories subject to compulsory landing which do not comply with this obligation in accordance with the relevant datasheets may be subject to a 5 % increase in the payment of the next fee. If the offence is repeated, these penalties will be reviewed by the Joint Committee.

ERS protocol

Appendix 11

PROTOCOL FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM FOR COMMUNICATING DATA RELATING TO FISHING ACTIVITY (ERS SYSTEM)

General provisions

1.

All EU fishing vessels must be equipped with an electronic system, hereinafter referred to as an 'ERS', capable of recording and transmitting data on the vessel's fishing activities, hereinafter referred to as 'ERS data', when the vessel is operating in the Moroccan fishing zone.

2.

An EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS, or whose ERS is not working, shall not be authorised to enter the Moroccan fishing zone in order to engage in fishing activities.

3.

ERS data shall be transmitted, in accordance with the procedures of the vessel's flag State to the Fisheries Monitoring and Control Centre (CSCP) of the flag State.

4.

The CSCP of the flag State shall transmit instant messages from the vessel (COE, COX, PNO) automatically and without delay to the CSCP in Morocco. Daily catch declarations (FAR) shall be made available automatically and without delay to the CSCP in Morocco.

5.

The flag State and Morocco shall ensure that their CSCPs have the necessary IT equipment and software to automatically transmit ERS data in XML format, available on the website of DG Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, and shall have a backup procedure in place capable of saving and storing ERS data in a format which will be computer-readable for at least three years.

6.

Any change or update to this format shall be identified and dated and must be operational six months after its introduction.

7.

ERS data must be transmitted using the electronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf of the EU, referred to as the DEH (Data Exchange Highway).

8.

The flag State and Morocco shall each designate an ERS correspondent who will act as the point of contact.

9.

ERS correspondents shall be designated for a minimum period of six months.

10.

The CSCP of the flag State and that of Morocco shall notify each other of the contact details (name, address, telephone and telex numbers and emails) of their ERS correspondents, once the ERS system is operational. Any changes to the contact details of the ERS correspondent must be notified immediately.

Producing and communicating ERS data

11.

EU fishing vessels must:

(a)

draw up ERS data on a daily basis for each day spent in the Moroccan fishing zone;

(b)

record, for each seine or trawl tow or set of a longline, the quantities of each species caught and retained on board as a target species and bycatch, or rejected;

(c)

for each species identified in the fishing authorization issued by Morocco, also declare zero catches;

(d)

identify each species using its FAO alpha-3 code;

(e)

express the quantities in kilograms of live weight or, where necessary, the number of individual fish;

(f)

record, in the ERS data, the transhipped and/or unloaded quantity of each species;

(g)

record, in the ERS data, a specific message declaring the quantities held on board of each species specified in the fishing authorisation issued by Morocco at each entry into (COE) or exit from (COX) the Moroccan fishing zone;

(h)

provide daily transmissions of ERS data to the CSCP of the flag State as referred to in paragraph 5, electronically and in XML format, at 23:59 hours UTC at the latest.

12.

The master is responsible for the accuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent.

13.

The CSCP of the flag State shall automatically and promptly provide the CPSC of Morocco with ERS data in XML format, as referred to in paragraph 5.

14.

The CSCP of Morocco shall acknowledge receipt of all ERS messages received in the form of a return message (RET).

15.

The CSCP of Morocco shall treat ERS data confidentially.

Failure of the on-board ERS and/or transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the CSCP of the flag State

16.

The flag State shall without delay inform the master and/or owner of a vessel flying its flag, or his representative, of any technical failure of the ERS installed on board or breakdown in transmission of ERS data between the vessel and the CSCP of the flag State.

17.

The flag State shall inform Morocco of the failure detected and the corrective measures taken.

18.

In the event of a breakdown in the on-board ERS, the master and/or owner shall ensure the ERS is repaired or replaced within ten working days. If the vessel makes a call at a port within those 10 days, it may only resume fishing activity in the Moroccan fishing zone once its ERS is in perfect working order, unless Morocco authorises otherwise.

19.

Following a technical failure in its ERS, a fishing vessel may only leave port:

(a)

when the system is once again operational, to the satisfaction of the flag State, or

(b)

beforehand, if it receives authorisation from the flag State. In the latter case, the flag State shall inform Morocco of its decision before the vessel leaves.

20.

Any EU vessel operating in the Moroccan fishing zone using a defective ERS system shall transmit its ERS data, on a daily basis and by 23:59 hours UTC, to the CSCP of the flag State by any other electronic communication means available.

21.

ERS data as referred to in paragraph 11 which have not been made available to Morocco because of a technical failure are to be transmitted by the CSCP of the flag State to the Moroccan CSCP in an alternative electronic format to be mutually agreed. This alternative transmission shall be considered priority, it being understood that it will not be possible to comply with the transmission deadlines usually applicable.

22.

If the Moroccan CSCP does not receive the ERS data from a vessel for three consecutive days, Morocco may instruct a vessel to immediately call at a port of Morocco's choosing in order to investigate.

CSCP failure - ERS data not received by Moroccan CSCP

23.

If a CSCP does not receive ERS data, its ERS correspondent shall inform the ERS correspondent of the other CSCP without delay and, if necessary, cooperate for as long as is needed to resolve the problem.

24.

The CSCP of the flag State and the Moroccan CSCP shall mutually agree on the alternative means of electronic communication to be used in order to transmit ERS data in the event of a CSCP failure, and shall immediately inform one another of any changes.

25.

If the Moroccan CSCP reports that ERS data have not been received, the CSCP of the flag State shall identify the causes of the problem and take appropriate measures in order to resolve it. The CSCP of the flag State shall notify the Moroccan CSCP and the EU of the results of its examination and the measures taken, within 24 hours.

26.

If more than 24 hours are required to resolve the problem, the CSCP of the flag State shall transmit the missing ERS data to the Moroccan CSCP without delay via the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 24.

27.

Morocco shall inform its competent inspection services so that EU vessels are not considered to be in breach of their obligation to transmit ERS data owing to the technical failure of a CSCP.

CSCP maintenance

28.

Planned maintenance of a CSCP (maintenance programme) which may affect the exchange of ERS data must be notified at least 72 hours in advance to the other CSCP, indicating, where possible, the date and duration of the maintenance work. Information on unplanned maintenance work shall be sent to the other CSCP as soon as possible.

29.

During the maintenance work, the provision of ERS data may be put on hold until the system is operational again. The relevant ERS data shall be made available immediately after the maintenance work has been completed.

30.

If the maintenance work takes more than 24 hours, the ERS data shall be sent to the other CSCP using the alternative means of electronic communication referred to in point 24.

31.

Morocco shall inform its competent inspection services so that EU vessels are not considered to be in breach of their obligation to transmit ERS data owing to the maintenance of a CSCP.
