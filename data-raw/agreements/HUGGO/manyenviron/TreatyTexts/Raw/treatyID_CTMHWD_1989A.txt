basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposalsource: preamblethe parties to this convention,aware of the risk of damage to human health and the environment caused by hazardous wastes and other wastes and the transboundary movement thereof,mindful of the growing threat to human health and the environment posed by the increased generation and complexity, and transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes,mindful also that the most effective way of protecting human health and the environment from the dangers posed by such wastes is the reduction of their generation to a minimum in terms of quantity and/or hazard potential,convinced that states should take necessary measures to ensure that the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes including their transboundary movement and disposal is consistent with the protection of human health and the environment whatever the place of disposal,noting that states should ensure that the generator should carry out duties with regards to the transport and disposal of hazardous wastes and other wastes in a manner that is consistent with the protection of the environment, whatever the place of disposal.fully recognizing that any state has the sovereign right to ban the entry or disposal of foreign hazardous wastes and other wastes in its territory,recognizing also the increasing desire for the prohibition of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal in other states, especially developing countries,convinced that hazardous wastes and other wastes should, as far as is compatible with environmentally sound and efficient management, be disposed of in the state where they were generated,aware also that transboundary movements of such wastes from the state of their generation to any other state should be permitted only when conducted under conditions which do not endanger human health and the environment, and under conditions in conformity with the provisions of this convention,considering that enhanced control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes will act as an incentive for their environmentally sound management and for the reduction of the volume of such transboundary movement,convinced that states should take measures for the proper exchange of information on and control of the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes from and to those states,noting that a number of international and regional agreements have addressed the issue of protection and preservation of the environment with regard to the transit of dangerous goods,taking into account the declaration of the united nations conference on the human environment (stockholm, 1972), the cairo guidelines and principles for the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes adopted by the governing council of the united nations environment programme (unep) by decision 14/30 of 17 june 1987, the recommendations of the united nations committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods (formulated in 1957 and updated biennially), relevant recommendations, declarations, instruments and regulations adopted within the united nations system and the work and studies done within other international and regional organizations,mindful of the spirit, principles, aims and functions of the world charter for nature adopted by the general assembly of the united nations at its thirty-seventh session (1982) as the rule of ethics in respect of the protection of the human environment and the conservation of natural resources,affirming that states are responsible for the fulfilment of their international obligations concerning the protection of human health and protection and preservation of the environment, and are liable in accordance with international law,recognizing that in the case of a material breach of the provisions of this convention or any protocol thereto the relevant international law of treaties shall apply,aware of the need to continue the development and implementation of environmentally sound low-waste technologies, recycling options, good house-keeping and management systems with a view to reducing to a minimum the generation of hazardous wastes and other wastes,aware also of the growing international concern about the need for stringent control of transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, and of the need as far as possible to reduce such movement to a minimum,concerned about the problem of illegal transboundary traffic in hazardous wastes and other wastes,taking into account also the limited capabilities of the developing countries to manage hazardous wastes and other wastes,recognizing the need to promote the transfer of technology for the sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes produced locally, particularly to the developing countries in accordance with the spirit of the cairo guidelines and decision 14/16 of the governing council of unep on promotion of the transfer of environmental protection technology,recognizing also that hazardous wastes and other wastes should be transported in accordance with relevant international conventions and recommendations,convinced also that the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes should be permitted only when the transport and the ultimate disposal of such wastes is environmentally sound, anddetermined to protect, by strict control, human health and the environment against the adverse effects which may result from the generation and management of hazardous wastes and other wastes,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1scope of

householdsy47 - residues arising from the incineration of household wastes ANNEX iiilist of hazardous characteristicsun class[2] code characteristics1 h1 explosivean explosive substance or waste is a solid or liquid substance or waste (or mixture of substances or wastes) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of producing gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.3 h3 flammable liquidsthe word "flammable" has the same meaning as "inflammable." flammable liquids are liquids, or mixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in solution or suspension (for example, paints, varnishes, lacquers, etc., but not including substances or wastes otherwise classified on account of their dangerous characteristics) which give off a flammable vapour at temperatures of not more than 60.5 c, closed-cup test, or not more than 65.6c, open-cup test. (since the results of open-cup tests and of closed-cup tests are not strictly comparable and even individual results by the same test are often variable, regulations varying from the above figures to make allowance for such differences would be within the spirit of this definition.)4.1 h4.1 flammable solidssolids, or waste solids, other than those classed as explosives, which under conditions encountered in transport are readily combustible, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.4.2 h4.2 substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustionsubstances or wastes which are liable to spontaneous heating under normal conditions encountered in transport, or to heating up on contact with air, and being then liable to catch fire.4.3 h4.3 substances or wastes which, in contact with water emit flammable gasessubstances or wastes which, by interaction with water, are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities.5.1 h5.1 oxidizingsubstances or wastes which, while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may, generally by yielding oxygen cause, or contribute to, the combustion of other materials.5.2 h5.2 organic peroxidesorganic substances or wastes which contain the bivalent-o-o- structure are thermally unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition.6.1 h6.1 poisonous (acute)substances or wastes liable either to cause death or serious injury or to harm health if swallowed or inhaled or by skin contact.6.2 h6.2 infectious substancessubstances or wastes containing viable micro organisms or their toxins which are known or suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.8 h8 corrosivessubstances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause severe damage when in contact with living tissue, or, in the case of leakage, will materially damage, or even destroy, other goods or the means of transport; they may also cause other hazards.9 h10 liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or watersubstances or wastes which, by interaction with air or water, are liable to give off toxic gases in dangerous quantities.9 h11 toxic (delayed or chronic)substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may involve delayed or chronic effects, including carcinogenicity.9 h12 ecotoxicsubstances or wastes which if released present or may present immediate or delayed adverse impacts to the environment by means of bioaccumulation and/or toxic effects upon biotic systems.9 h13 capable, by any means, after disposal, of yielding another material, e.g., leachate, which possesses any of the characteristics listed above.teststhe potential hazards posed by certain types of wastes are not yet fully documented; tests to define quantitatively these hazards do not exist. further research is necessary in order to develop means to characterize potential hazards posed to man and/or the environment by these wastes. standardized tests have been derived with respect to pure substances and materials. many countries have developed national tests which can be applied to materials listed in annex i, in order to decide if these materials exhibit any of the characteristics listed in this annex ANNEX ivdisposal operationsa. operations which do not lead to the possibility of resource recovery, recycling, reclamation,

its fourth meeting modified annex i by adding these four paragraphs (a, b, c and d) at the end of annex i, and added two additional annexes viii and ix to the convention.[2] corresponds to the hazard classification system included in the united nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods (st/sg/ac.10/1rev.5, united nations, new york, 1988)[3] decision iii/1 (amendment to the basel convention)the conference,decides to adopt the following amendment to the convention:"insert new preambular paragraph 7 bis:recognizing that transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, especially to developing countries, have a high risk of not constituting an environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes as required by this convention;insert new article 4a:1. each party listed in annex vii shall prohibit all transboundary movements of hazardous wastes which are destined for operations according to annex iv a, to states not listed in annex vii.2. each party listed in annex vii shall phase out by 31 december 1997, and prohibit as of that date, all transboundary movements of hazardous wastes under article 1, paragraph 1 (a) of the convention which are destined for operations according to annex iv b to states not listed in annex vii. such transboundary movements shall not be prohibited unless the wastes in question are characterized as hazardous under the convention ANNEX viiparties and other states which are members of oecd, ec, liechtenstein"[4] note that mirror entry on list b (b1160) does not specify exceptions.[5] this entry does not include scrap assemblies from electric power generation.[6] pcbs are at a concentration level of 50 mg/kg or more.[7] the 50 mg/kg level is considered to be an internationally practical level for all wastes. however, many individual countries have established lower regulatory levels (e.g., 20 mg/kg) for specific wastes.[8] "outdated" means unused within the period recommended by the manufacturer.[9] this entry does not include wood treated with wood preserving chemicals.[10] "outdated" means unused within the period recommended by the manufacturer.[11] note that even where low level contamination with annex i materials initially exists, subsequent processes, including recycling processes, may result in separated fractions containing significantly enhanced concentrations of those annex i materials.[12] the status of zinc ash is currently under review and there is a recommendation with the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) that zinc ashes should not be dangerous goods.[13] this entry does not include scrap from electrical power generation.[14] reuse can include repair, refurbishment or upgrading, but not major reassembly.[15] in some countries these materials destined for direct re-use are not considered wastes.[16] it is understood that such scraps are completely polymerized.[17] - post-consumer wastes are excluded from this entry- wastes shall not be mixed- problems arising from open-burning practices to be considered
