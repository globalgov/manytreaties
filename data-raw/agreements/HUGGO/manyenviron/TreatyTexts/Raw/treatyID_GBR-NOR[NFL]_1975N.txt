EXCHANGE OF NOTES CONSTITUTING AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF
GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY CONCERNING
THE CREATION OF CERTAIN TRAWLER-FREE ZONES IN
AREAS ADJACENT TO THE PRESENT NORWEGIAN FISHERY
LIMIT
NOTE I
The Minister without Portfolio of Norway to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Oslo
Oslo, 30 January 1975
Your Excellency,
I have the honour to refer to the discussions which have taken place between
our two Governments concerning the question of creating certain trawler-free zones
in areas adjacent to the present Norwegian fishery limit, and to the letters exchanged
between Norway and the European Economic Community on 29 January 1975.
In the discussions, the Norwegian side referred to the inadequacy of the existing
arrangements to protect concentrations of Norwegian fixed fishing gear against
damage by trawlers. In the light of these discussions and as a further contribution to
the endeavours of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission to conserve fish
stocks, my Government wishes to propose the following:
1. Vessels of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland using trawls
will not fish in the zones and during the periods specified in the Annex attached to this Note.
2. All vessels using trawls, including Norwegian vessels, will be subject to the same
restrictions without any discrimination. Any exemptions from these restrictions or any more
favourable conditions for trawlers which Norway may grant to its vessels or agree upon with
other states shall equally apply to vessels of the United Kingdom.
3. Each Government shall take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with these
provisions. To this end, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland shall ensure that trawlers registered in the United Kingdom do not fish within the
areas defined in the Annex during the periods specified.
If there is reason to believe that an infringement of these provisions has occurred, the
commander of a Norwegian fishery protection vessel may stop, board and inspect trawlers
registered in the United Kingdom in any trawler-free zone defined in the Annex.
Such inspection, which shall be carried out with due regard to the need for safe navigation
and the rules of good seamanship, shall be by an authorised officer, who may board the vessel
to inspect relevant documents and the fishing gear. If the officer consi~ers that an infringement
has occurred, he may instruct the Master of the trawler to cease fishing and to leave the
zone. The authorised officer shall draw up a report for submission to the flag state.
Nothing in the provisions of this paragraph shall affect the arrangements already in force
between our two countries governing the inspection of fishing vessels.
4. Nothing in. this Agreement shall be deemed to prejudice the views of either Government
as to any question concerning the Law of the Sea, including jurisdiction in fishery matters.
5. If the foregoing proposals are acceptable to the United Kingdom Government,
I have the honour to propose that this Note and Your Excellency's reply in
that sense shall constitute an Agreement between our two Governments which shall
become effective today and shall remain in force until terminated by written communication
from either Party with not less than four months' notice and having due
regard to the effects of termination upon seasonal fishing operations.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of
my highest consideration.
