delegation to the international conference on marine pollution 1973 which was in the following terms:" ... australia believes that no coastal state would refrain from taking whatever action was necessary to protect areas under its jurisdiction from serious environmental damage and it believes that this right of a coastal state to intervene on the high seas to protect areas under its jurisdiction is recognised under customary international law."in becoming a party to the convention australia declares that it believes that it may still take action to protect areas and resources under its jurisdiction which is permitted under customary international law and which is consistent with the convention".
