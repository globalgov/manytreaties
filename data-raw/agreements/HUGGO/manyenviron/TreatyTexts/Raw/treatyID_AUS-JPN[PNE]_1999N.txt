NOTE VERBALE

The Embassy of Japan presents its compliments to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has the honour to refer to the Implementing Arrangement (hereinafter referred to as "the Implementing Arrangement") attached to the Notes exchanged at Canberra on 5 March 1982, constituting an agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of Australia pursuant to Article V of the Agreement between the Government of Japan and the Government of Australia for Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, done at Canberra on the same date.[1]

The Embassy has further the honour to refer to consultations held on 4 September 1997 at Canberra and on 14 July 1998 at Tokyo concerning amendments to the delineated and recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program provided for in paragraph I of the Implementing Arrangement.

The Embassy has further the honour to propose, on behalf of the Government of Japan, the following additions to the list of facilities for fuel fabrication listed in Section 4 of the delineated and recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program (as of 1 July 1996) pursuant to paragraph III.2 of the Implementing Arrangement:

as a new sub-section after 4.1.4, add

"4.1.5 Westinghouse Electric Corporation Columbia Plant (U.S.A.)
  
  4.1.6 Siemens Power Corporation Richland Plant (U.S.A.)"

If the foregoing proposal is acceptable to the Government of Australia, the Embassy has further the honour to propose that this Note Verbale and the Department's Note Verbale in reply to that effect shall be regarded as constituting an agreement to amend the delineated and recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program (as of 1 July 1996) as proposed above and that the agreement shall enter into force on the date on which the Government of Australia notifies the Government of Japan through the diplomatic channel that its constitutional and domestic requirements for the entry into force of the agreement in Australia have been satisfied.[2]
