convention for the prevention of marine pollution by dumping from ships and alrcraftsource: the contracting partiesrecognizing that the marine environment and the living resources which it supports are of vital importance to all nations;mindful that the ecological equilibrium and the legitimate uses of the sea are increasingly threatened by pollution;recognizing that concerted action by governments at national, regional and global levels is essential to prevent and combat marine pollution;noting that this pollution has many sources, including dumping from ships and aircraft and discharges through rivers, estuaries, outfalls and pipelines within national jurisdiction, that it is important that states use the best practicable means to prevent such pollution, and that products and processes which will minimize the amount of harmful waste requiring disposal should be developed;being convinced that international action to control the pollution of the sea by the dumping of harmful substances from ships and aircraft can and should be taken without delay, but that this action should not preclude discussion of measures to control other sources of marine pollution as soon as possible;considering that the states bordering the north-east atlantic have a peculiar responsibility to protect that waters of this region;have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1the contracting parties pledge themselves to take all possible steps to prevent the pollution of the sea by substances that are liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage

parts of the atlantic and arctic oceans and their dependent seas which lie north of 36 deg north latitude and between 42 deg west longitude and 51 deg east longitude, but excluding(i) the baltic sea and belts lying to the south and east of lines drawn from hasenore head to gniben point, from korshage to spodsbierg and from gilbierg head to the kullen, and(ii) the mediterranean sea and its dependent seas as far as the point of intersection of the parallel of 36 deg north latitude and the meridian of 5 deg 36 min west longitude.b) within that part of atlantic ocean north of 59 deg north latitude and between 44 deg west longitude and 42 deg west longitude ARTICLE 3the contracting parties agree to apply measures which they adopt in such a way as to prevent the diversion of dumping of
