energy charter protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspectssource: unofficial textpreamblethe contracting parties to this protocol,having regard to the european energy charter adopted in the concluding document of the hague conference on the european energy charter, signed at the hague on 17 december 1991; and in particular to the declarations therein that cooperation is necessary in the field of energy efficiency and related environmental protection;having regard also to the energy charter treaty, opened for signature from 17 december 1994 to 16 june 1995;mindful of the work undertaken by international organizations and fora in the field of energy efficiency and environmental aspects of the energy cycle;aware of the improvements in supply security, and of the significant economic and environmental gains, which result from the implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency measures; and aware of their importance for restructuring economies and improving living standards;recognizing that improvements in energy efficiency reduce negative environmental consequences of the energy cycle including global warming and acidification;convinced that energy prices should reflect as far as possible a competitive market, ensuring market-oriented price formation, including fuller reflection of environmental costs and benefits, and recognizing that such price formation is vital to progress in energy efficiency and associated environmental protection;appreciating the vital role of the private sector including small and medium-sized enterprises in promoting and implementing energy efficiency measures, and intent on ensuring a favourable institutional framework for economically viable investment in energy efficiency;recognizing that commercial forms of cooperation may need to be complemented by intergovernmental cooperation, particularly in the area of energy policy formulation and analysis as well as in other areas which are essential to the enhancement of energy efficiency but not suitable for private funding; anddesiring to undertake cooperative and coordinated action in the field of energy efficiency and related environmental protection and to adopt a protocol providing a framework for using energy as economically and efficiently as possible:have agreed as follows:part 1 introduction ARTICLE 1 scope and objectives of the protocol(1) this protocol defines policy principles for the promotion of energy efficiency as a considerable source of energy and for consequently reducing adverse environmental impacts of energy systems. it furthermore provides guidance on the development of energy efficiency programmes, indicates areas of cooperation and provides a framework for the development of cooperative and coordinated action. such action may include the prospecting for, exploration, production, conversion, storage, transport, distribution, and consumption of energy, and may relate to any economic sector.(2) the objectives of this protocol are:(a) the promotion of energy efficiency policies consistent with sustainable development;(b) the creation of framework conditions which induce producers and consumers to use energy as economically, efficiently and environmentally soundly as possible, particularly through the organization of efficient energy markets and a fuller reflection of environmental costs and benefits; and(c) the fostering of cooperation in the field of energy efficiency ARTICLE 2 definitions as used in this protocol:(1) "charter" means the european energy charter adopted in the concluding document of the hague conference on the european energy charter signed at the hague on 17 december 1991; signature of the concluding document is considered to be signature of the charter.(2) "contracting party" means a state or regional economic integration organization which has consented to be bound by this protocol and for which the protocol is in force.(3) "regional economic integration organization" means an organization constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this protocol, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.(4) "energy cycle" means the entire energy chain, including activities related to prospecting for, exploration, production, conversion, storage, transport, distribution and consumption of the various forms of energy, and the treatment and disposal of wastes, as well as the decommissioning, cessation or closure of these activities, minimizing harmful environmental impacts.(5) "cost-effectiveness" means to achieve a defined objective at the lowest cost or to achieve the greatest benefit at a given cost.(6) "improving energy efficiency" means acting to maintain the same unit of output (of a good or service) without reducing the quality or performance of the output, while reducing the amount of energy required to produce that output.(7) "environmental impact" means any effect caused by a given activity on the environment, including human health and safety, flora, fauna, soil, air, water, climate, landscape and historical monuments or other physical structures or the interactions among these factors; it also includes effects on cultural heritage or socio-economic conditions resulting from alterations to those factors.part 2 policy principles ARTICLE 3 basic principlescontracting parties shall be guided by the following principles:(1) contracting parties shall cooperate and, as appropriate, assist
