 convention for the protection of the rhine against chemical pollutionsource: unofficial textthe government of the federal republic of germany, the government of the french republic, the government of the grand duchy of luxembourg, the government of the kingdom of the netherlands, the government of the swiss confederation, and the european economic community,having regard to the agreement of 29 april 1963 and the additional agreement of 3 december 1976 concerning the international commission for the protection of the rhine against pollution,whereas chemical pollution of the rhine threatens for certain uses of the waters of the rhine;aware of the dangers that may result therefrom from certain uses of the waters of the rhine;desirous of improving the quality of rhine water for these uses;whereas the rhine is used for other purposes such as navigation and as the receiving medium for waste waters;convinced that international action for the protection of the rhine against chemical pollution must be assessed in conjunction with other efforts to protect the rhine, particularly efforts to conclude agreements against pollution by chlorides and thermal pollution, and that such action is one of the continuous and coherent measures to protect fresh water and sea water from pollution;whereas the european economic community has taken measures to protect the aquatic environment particularly within the framework of the council directive of 4 may 1976 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the community;having regard to the results of the ministerial conferences of 25 and 26 october 1972 in the hague, 4 and 5 december 1973 and 1 april 1976 in paris on the protection of the rhine against pollution,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 11. the contracting parties shall, in accordance with the following provisions, take the appropriate measures, with a view to improving the quality of the waters of the rhine, to:a) eliminate pollution of the surface waters of the rhine basin by dangerous substances in the families and groups of substances appearing in annex i (hereinafter referred to as "annex i substances"). the purpose of the measures is to effect substances, taking into account the findings of investigations carried out by experts separately for each one of them and the available technical means;b) reduce the pollution of the rhine by the dangerous substances in the families and groups of substances appearing in annex ii (hereinafter referred to as "annex ii substances").2. the measures referred to in paragraph 1 above shall take into reasonable account the fact that rhine water is used for:a) the production of drinking water for human consumption;b) consumption by domestic and wild animals;c) the conservation and development of the national species of flora and fauna and the preservation of the self-purifying capacity of water;d) fishing;e) recreational purposes, bearing in mind hygienic and aesthetic requirements;f) the direct or indirect supply of fresh water to agricultural lands;g) the production of water for industrial purposes, and the need to preserve an acceptable quality of sea water.3. the provisions of this convention shall constitute only an initial step towards the achievement of the objectives set out in paragraph 1 above.4 ANNEX a to this convention shall determine what the contracting parties mean by the word "rhine" for the purposes of applying the said convention ARTICLE 21. the governments which are parties to this convention shall, pursuant

emission standards.2. pursuant to annex iii (2), the governments shall communicate to the international commission for the protection of the rhine against pollution (hereinafter referred to as the "international commission") the contents of their inventories, which shall be regularly updated at intervals not exceeding three years.3. the proposals of the international commission provided for in article 6 (3) may, if necessary, include an inventory of various substances falling under annex ii ARTICLE 31. any discharge into the surface waters of the rhine basin likely to contain a substance referred to in annex i shall be subject to prior authorization from the responsible authorities of the government concerned.2. for discharges of these substances into the surface waters of the rhine basin and, when necessary for the purpose of applying this convention, for discharges of these substances into sewers, the authorization shall fix emission standards which may not exceed the limit values laid down in accordance with article 5. 3. in the case of existing discharges of these substances, the authorization shall fix a time limit within which the conditions laid down in the authorization must be met. this time limit must not exceed the period laid down in accordance with article 5 (3).4. the authorization may only be granted for a limited period of time. it may be renewed in the light of any alternations in the limit values referred to in article 5 ARTICLE 41. the emission standards laid down in the authorizations issued pursuant to article 3 shall establish:a) the maximum permissible concentration of a substance in discharges. in cases where there is dilution, the limit value provided for in article 5 (2) (a) shall be divided by the dilution factor;b) the maximum permissible quantity of a substance in discharges during one or more specific periods. if necessary this quantity may also be expressed as a unit of weight of the pollutant per unit of the characteristic element of the polluting activity (e. g. unit of weight per unit of raw material or product unit).2. if the discharger states that he is unable to conform to the emission standards or if the responsible authorities of the government concerned establish this, authorization shall be refused.3. if the emission standards are not observed, the responsible authorities of the government concerned shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the conditions for the authorization are met and, if necessary that the discharge is prohibited ARTICLE 51. the international commission

where appropriate, the maximum permissible quantity of such a substance expressed as a unit of weight of the pollutant per unit of the characteristic element of the polluting activity (e. g unit of weight per unit of raw material or product unit).where appropriate, the limit values applicable to industrial effluent shall be laid down individually by sector and by type of product.the limit values applicable to annex i substances shall be laid down mainly on the basis of- toxicity,- persistence, - bioaccumulation,taking into account the best available technical means.3. the international commission shall propose to the contracting parties the time limits referred to in article 3 (3), making due allowance for the specific characteristics of the industrial sectors involved and, as appropriate, the types of product. these time limits shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 14.4. the international commission shall use the results obtained at international measuring points to determine the extent to which the level of annex i substances in the rhine varies following the application of the above provisions.5. as regards the quality of rhine water, the international commission may if necessary propose other measures for reducing the pollution of the rhine taking into account, inter alia, the toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation of the substance under consideration. these proposals shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 14 ARTICLE 61. the discharge of any annex ii substance likely to affect the quality of rhine water must be regulated by the national authorities with a view to limiting it strictly.2. the governments which are parties to this convention shall strive to establish, within a
