been developed for the safe conduct of cas surveys. although the mandatory requirements make explicit reference to the cas survey and to attending surveyor(s) it shall be used also in connection with any thickness measurement work required by the cas.2 conditions for survey2.1 the company shall provide the necessary facilities for a safe conduct of the cas survey.2.2 in cases where the provisions of safety and required access are judged by the attending surveyors not to be adequate, the cas survey of the spaces involved shall not proceed.2.3 in order to enable the attending surveyors to carry out the cas survey, provisions for proper and safe access, shall be agreed between company and recognised organisation.2.4 details of the means of access are provided in the survey planning questionnaire. 2.5 tanks and spaces shall be safe for access*. tanks and spaces shall be gas free and shall be ventilated. prior to entering a tank, void or enclosed space, it shall be verified that the atmosphere in the tank is free from hazardous gas and contains sufficient oxygen.2.6 tanks and spaces shall be sufficiently clean and free from water, scale, dirt, oil residues, corrosion scale, sediments etc., to reveal significant corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating.2.7 sufficient illumination shall be provided to reveal significant corrosion, deformation, fractures, damages or other structural deterioration as well as the condition of the coating.2.8 where soft coatings have been applied, safe access shall be provided for the attending surveyor(s) to verify the effectiveness of the coating and to carry out an assessment of the conditions of internal structures, which may include spot removal of the coating. where the presence of soft coating inhibits safe access, the soft coating shall be removed.2.9 the attending surveyor(s) shall always be accompanied by at least one responsible person assigned by the company experienced in tank and enclosed spaces inspection. in addition a backup team of at least two experienced persons shall be stationed at the hatch opening of the tank or space that is being surveyed. the back-up team shall continuously observe the work in the tank or space and shall keep lifesaving and evacuation equipment ready for use.* reference is made to chapter 10 of the international safety guide for oil tankers and terminals (isgott) - entry into and working in enclosed spaces.3 access to structures3.1 for overall survey, means shall be provided to enable the attending surveyors to examine the structure in a safe and practical way.3.2 for close-up survey, one or more of the following means for access, acceptable to the attending surveyors, shall be provided:- permanent staging and passages through structures- temporary staging and passages through structures- lifts and moveable platforms- rafts or boats- other equivalent means.3.3 surveys of tanks or spaces by means of rafts or boats may only be undertaken with the agreement of the attending surveyors, who shall take into account the safety arrangements provided, including weather forecasting and ship response in reasonable sea conditions.3.4 when rafts or boats will be used for close up survey the following conditions shall be observed:.1 only rough duty, inflatable rafts or boats, having satisfactory residual buoyancy and stability even if one chamber is ruptured, shall be used;.2 the boat or raft shall be tethered to the access ladder and an additiona l person shall be stationed down the access ladder with a clear view of the boat or raft;.3 appropriate lifejackets shall be available for all participants;.4 the surface of water in the tank shall be calm (under all foreseeable conditions the expected rise of water within the tank shall not exceed 0.25 m) and the water level either stationary or falling. on no account shall the level of the water be rising while the boat or raft is in use;.5 the tank or space must contain clean ballast water only. even a thin sheen of oil on the water is not acceptable;.6 at no time shall the water level be allowed to be within 1 m of the deepest under deck web face flat so that the survey team is not isolated from a direct escape route to the tank hatch. filling to levels above the deck transverses shall only be contemplated if a deck access manhole is fitted and open in the bay being examined, so that an escape route for the survey party is available at all times;.7 if the tanks (or spaces) are connected by a common venting system, or inert gas system, the tank in which the boat or raft is to be used shall be isolated to prevent a transfer of gas from other tanks (or spaces).3.5 in addition to the above rafts or boats alone may be allowed for inspection of the under deck areas for tanks or spaces, if the depth of the webs are 1.5 m or less.3.6 if the depth of the webs is more than 1.5 m, rafts or boats alone may be allowed only:.1 when the coating of the under deck structure is in good condition and there no evidence of wastage; or.2 if a permanent means of access is provided in each bay to allow safe entry and exit. this means of access is to be direct from the deck via a vertical ladder and a small platform shall be fitted approximately 2 m below the deck.if neither of the above conditions are met then staging shall be provided for the survey of the under deck area.4 equipment for survey4.1 thickness measurement shall normally be carried out by means of ultrasonic test equipment. the accuracy of the equipment shall be proven to the attending surveyor(s) as required.4.2 one or more of the following fracture detection procedures may be required if deemed necessary by the attending surveyor(s): -radiographic equipment -ultrasonic equipment -magnetic particle equipment-dye penetrant -other equivalent means.4.3 explosimeter, oxygen-meter, breathing apparatus, lifelines, riding belts with rope and hook and whistles together with instructions and guidance on their use shall be made available during the cas survey. a safety check-list shall be provided.4.4 adequate and safe lighting shall be provided for the safe and efficient conduct of the cas survey.4.5 adequate protective clothing shall be made available and used (e.g. safety helmet, gloves, safety shoes, etc) during the cas survey.5 meetings and communication arrangements5.1 the establishment of proper preparation and the close co-operation between the attending surveyors and the company's representatives onboard prior to and during the cas survey are an essential part in the safe and efficient conduct of the cas survey. during the cas survey on board safety meetings shall be held regularly.5.2 prior to commencement of the cas survey a survey meeting shall be held between the attending surveyors the company's representative(s) in attendance, the tm firm operator (asapplicable) and the master of the ship for the purpose to ascertain that all the arrangements envisaged in the survey plan are in place, so as to ensure the safe and efficient conduct of the survey work to be carried out.5.3 the following is an indicative list of items that shall be addressed in the meeting:.1 schedule of the vessel (i.e. the voyage, docking and undocking manoeuvres, periods alongside, cargo and ballast operations etc.);.2 provisions and arrangements for thickness measurements (i.e. access, cleaning/de-scaling, illumination, ventilation, personal safety);.3 extent of the thickness measurements;.4 acceptance criteria (refer to the list of minimum thicknesses);.5 extent of close up survey and thickness measurement considering the coating condition and suspect areas/areas of substantial corrosion;.6 execution of thickness measurements;.7 taking representative readings in general and where uneven corrosion/pitting is found;.8 mapping of areas of substantial corrosion;.9 communication between attending surveyor(s) the tm operator(s) and company representative(s) concerning findings.5.4 a communication system shall be arranged between the survey party in the tank or space being examined, the responsible officer on deck and, as the case may be, the navigation bridge. this system shall also include the personnel in charge of handling the ballast pump(s) if rafts or boats are used. the communication arrangements shall be maintained throughout the cas survey."***
