the criteria and procedures to parties for the formulation and submission of proposals for the designation of emission control areas and to set forth the factors to be considered in the assessment of such proposals by the organization.1.2 emissions of nox, sox and particulate matter from ocean-going ships contribute to ambient concentrations of air pollution in cities and coastal areas around the world. adverse public health and environmental effects associated with air pollution include premature mortality, cardiopulmonary disease, lung cancer, chronic respiratory ailments, acidification and eutrophication.1.3 an emission control area should be considered for adoption by the organization if supported by a demonstrated need to prevent, reduce, and control emissions of nox or sox and particulate matter or all three types of emissions (hereinafter emissions) from ships.2 process for the designation of emission control areas2.1 a proposal to the organization for designation of an emission control area for nox or sox and particulate matter or all three types of emissions may be submitted only by parties. where two or more parties have a common interest in a particular area, they should formulate a coordinated proposal.2.2 a proposal to designate a given area as an emission control area should be submitted to the organization in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the organization.3 criteria for designation of an emission control area3.1 the proposal shall include:.1 a clear delineation of the proposed area of application, along with a reference chart on which the area is marked;.2 the type or types of emission(s) that is or are being proposed for control (i.e. nox or sox and particulate matter or all three types of emissions);.3 a description of the human populations and environmental areas at risk from the impacts of ship emissions;.4 an assessment that emissions from ships operating in the proposed area of application are contributing to ambient concentrations of air pollution or to adverse environmental impacts. such assessment shall include a description of the impacts of the relevant emissions on human health and the environment, such as adverse impacts to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, areas of natural productivity, critical habitats, water quality, human health, and areas of cultural and scientific significance, if applicable. the sources of relevant data including methodologies used shall be identified;.5 relevant information pertaining to the meteorological conditions in the proposed area of application to the human populations and environmental areas at risk, in particular prevailing wind patterns, or to topographical, geological, oceanographic, morphological, or other conditions that contribute to ambient concentrations of air pollution or adverse environmental impacts;.6 the nature of the ship traffic in the proposed emission control area, including the patterns and density of such traffic;.7 a description of the control measures taken by the proposing party or parties addressing land-based sources of nox, sox and particulate matter emissions affecting the human populations and environmental areas at risk that are in place and operating concurrent with the consideration of measures to be adopted in relation to provisions of regulations 13 and 14 of annex vi; and.8 the relative costs of reducing emissions from ships when compared with land-based controls, and the economic impacts on shipping engaged in international trade.3.2 the geographical limits of an emission control area will be based on the relevant criteria outlined above, including emissions and deposition from ships navigating in the proposed area, traffic patterns and density, and wind conditions.4 procedures for the assessment and adoption of emission control areas by the organization4.1 the organization shall consider each proposal submitted to it by a party or parties.4.2 in assessing the proposal, the organization shall take into account the criteria which are to be included in each proposal for adoption as set forth in section 3 above.4.3 an emission control area shall be designated by means of an amendment to this annex, considered, adopted and brought into force in accordance with article 16 of the present convention.5 operation of emission control areas5.1 parties which have ships navigating in the area are encouraged to bring to the organization any concerns regarding the operation of the area APPENDIX ivtype approval and operating limits for shipboard incinerators(regulation 16)1 ships incinerators described in regulation 16.6.1 on board shall possess an imo type approval certificate for each incinerator. in order to obtain such certificate, the incinerator shall be designed and built to an approved standard as described in regulation 16.6.1. each model shall be subject to a specified type approval test operation at the factory or an approved

the two sub-samples shall be tested in succession, in accordance with the specified test method referred to in appendix v. for the purposes of this verification procedure, the results of the test analysis shall be referred to as "a" and "b":.1 if the results of "a" and "b" are within the repeatability (r) of the test method, the results shall be considered valid..2 if the results of "a" and "b" are not within the repeatability (r) of the test method, both results shall be rejected and two new sub-samples should be taken by the laboratory and analysed. the sample bottle should be resealed in accordance with paragraph 2.3.3 above after the new sub-samples have been taken.2.5 if the test results of "a" and "b" are valid, an average of these two results should be calculated thus giving the result referred to as "x":.1 if the result of "x" is equal to or falls below the applicable limit required by annex vi, the fuel oil shall be deemed to meet the requirements..2 if the result of "x" is greater than the applicable limit required by annex vi, verification procedure stage 2 should be conducted; however, if the result of "x" is greater than the specification limit by 0.59r (where r is the reproducibility of the test method), the fuel oil shall be considered non-compliant and no further testing is necessary.3 verification procedure stage 23.1 if stage 2 of the verification procedure is necessary in accordance with paragraph 2.5.2 above, the competent authority shall send the marpol sample to a second accredited laboratory.3.2 upon receiving the marpol sample, the laboratory shall:.1 record the details of the reseal number applied in accordance with 2.3.3 and the sample label on the test record;.2 draw two sub-samples from the marpol sample; and.3 reseal the marpol sample and record the new reseal details on the test record.3.3 the two sub-samples shall be tested in succession, in accordance with the test method specified in appendix v. for the purposes of this verification procedure, the results of the test analysis shall be referred to as "c" and "d":.1 if the results of "c" and "d" are within the repeatability (r) of the test method, the results shall be considered valid..2 if the results of "c" and "d" are not within the repeatability (r) of the test method, both results shall be rejected and two new sub-samples shall be taken by the laboratory and analysed. the sample bottle should be resealed in accordance with paragraph 3.2.3 after the new sub-samples have been taken.3.4 if the test results of "c" and "d" are valid, and the results of "a", "b", "c", and "d" are within the reproducibility (r) of the test method then the laboratory shall average the results, which is referred to as "y":.1 if the result of "y" is equal to or falls below the applicable limit required by annex vi, the fuel oil shall be deemed to meet the requirements..2 if the result of "y" is greater than the applicable limit required by annex vi, then the fuel oil fails to meet the standards required by annex vi.3.5 if the result of "a", "b", "c" and "d" are not within the reproducibility (r) of the test method then the administration may discard all of the test results and, at its discretion, repeat the entire testing process.3.6 the results obtained from the verification procedure are final.footnotes[1] refer to the guidelines for the
