international convention for the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments, 2004source: the parties to this convention,recalling article 196(1) of the 1982 united nations convention on the law of the sea (unclos), which provides that "states shall take all measures necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment resulting from the use of technologies under their jurisdiction or control, or the intentional or accidental introduction of species, alien or new, to a particular part of the marine environment, which may cause significant and harmful changes thereto,"noting the objectives of the 1992 convention on biological diversity (cbd) and that the transfer and introduction of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens via ships' ballast water threatens the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity as well as decision iv/5 of the 1998 conference of the parties (cop 4) to the cbd concerning the conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems, as well as decision vi/23 of the 2002 conference of the parties (cop 6) to the cbd on alien species that threaten ecosystems, habitats or species, including guiding principles on invasive species,noting further that the 1992 united nations conference on environment and development (unced) requested the international maritime organization (the organization) to consider the adoption of appropriate rules on ballast water discharge,mindful of the precautionary approach set out in principle 15 of the rio declaration on environment and development and referred to in resolution mepc.67(37), adopted by the organization's marine environment protection committee on 15 september 1995,also mindful that the 2002 world summit on sustainable development, in paragraph 34(b) of its plan of implementation, calls for action at all levels to accelerate the development of measures to address invasive alien species in ballast water,conscious that the uncontrolled discharge of ballast water and sediments from ships has led to the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens, causing injury or damage to the environment, human health, property and resources,recognizing the importance placed on this issue by the organization through assembly resolutions a.774(18) in 1993 and a.868(20) in 1997, adopted for the purpose of addressing the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens,recognizing further that several states have taken individual action with a view to prevent, minimize and ultimately eliminate the risks of introduction of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through ships entering their ports, and also that this issue, being of worldwide concern, demands action based on globally applicable regulations together with guidelines for their effective implementation and uniform interpretation,desiring to continue the development of safer and more effective ballast water management options that will result in continued prevention, minimization and ultimate elimination of the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens,resolved to prevent, minimize and ultimately eliminate the risks to the environment, human health, property and resources arising from the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments, as well as to avoid unwanted side-effects from that control and to encourage developments in related knowledge and technology,considering that these objectives may best be achieved by the conclusion of an international convention for the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments,have agreed as follows: article 1 definitionsfor the purpose of this convention, unless expressly provided otherwise:1 "administration" means the government of the state under whose authority the ship is operating. with respect to a ship entitled to fly a flag of any state, the administration is the government of that state. with respect to floating platforms engaged in exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil thereof adjacent to the coast over which the coastal state exercises sovereign rights for the purposes of exploration and exploitation of its natural resources, including floating storage units (fsus) and floating production storage and offloading units (fpsos), the administration is the government of the coastal state concerned.2 "ballast water" means water with its suspended matter taken on board a ship to control trim, list, draught, stability or stresses of the ship.3 "ballast water management" means mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological processes, either singularly or in combination, to remove, render harmless,

"committee" means the marine environment protection committee of the organization.6 "convention" means the international convention for the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments.7 "gross tonnage" means the gross tonnage calculated in accordance with the tonnage measurement regulations contained in annex i to the international convention on tonnage measurement of ships, 1969 or any successor convention.8 "harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens" means aquatic organisms or pathogens which, if introduced into the sea including estuaries, or into fresh water courses, may create hazards to the environment, human health, property or resources, impair biological diversity or interfere with other legitimate uses of such areas.9 "organization" means the international maritime organization.10 "secretary-general" means the secretary-general of the organization.11 "sediments" means matter settled out of ballast water within a ship.12 "ship" means a

through the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments.2 the annex forms an integral part of this convention. unless expressly provided otherwise, a reference to this convention constitutes at the same time a reference to the annex.3 nothing in this convention shall be interpreted as preventing a party from taking, individually or jointly with other parties, more stringent measures with respect to the prevention, reduction or elimination of the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments, consistent with international law.4 parties shall endeavour to co-operate for the purpose of effective implementation, compliance and enforcement of this convention.5 parties undertake to encourage the continued development of ballast water management and standards to prevent, minimize and ultimately eliminate the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through the control and

those of other states.7 parties should ensure that ballast water management practices used to comply with this convention do not cause greater harm than they prevent to their environment, human health, property or resources, or those of other states.8 parties shall encourage ships entitled to fly their flag, and to which this convention applies, to avoid, as far as practicable, the uptake of ballast water with potentially harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens, as well as sediments that may contain such organisms, including promoting the adequate implementation of recommendations developed by the organization.9 parties shall endeavour to co-operate under the auspices of the organization to address threats and risks to sensitive, vulnerable or threatened marine ecosystems and biodiversity in areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction in relation to ballast water management ARTICLE 3 application1 except as expressly provided otherwise in this convention, this convention shall apply to:(a) ships entitled to fly the flag of a party; and(b) ships not entitled to fly the flag of a party but which operate under the authority of a party.2 this convention shall not apply to:(a) ships not designed or constructed to carry ballast water;(b) ships of a party which only operate in waters under the jurisdiction of that party, unless the party determines that the discharge of ballast water from such ships would impair or damage their environment, human health, property or resources, or those of adjacent or other states;(c) ships of a party which only operate in waters under the jurisdiction of another party, subject to the authorization of the latter party for such exclusion. no party shall grant such authorization if doing so would impair or damage their

measures undertaken with respect to ballast water management; andthe effectiveness of ballast water management deduced from any monitoring and assessment programmes ARTICLE 7 survey and certification1 each party shall ensure that ships flying its flag or operating under its authority and subject to survey and certification are so surveyed and certified in accordance with the regulations in the annex.2 a party implementing measures pursuant to article 2.3 and section c of the annex shall not require additional survey and certification of a ship of another party, nor shall the administration of the ship be obligated to survey and certify additional measures imposed by another party. verification of such additional measures shall be the responsibility of the party implementing such measures and shall not cause undue delay to the ship ARTICLE 8 violations1 any violation of the requirements of this convention shall be prohibited and sanctions shall be established under the law of the administration of the ship concerned, wherever the violation occurs. if the administration is informed of such a violation, it shall investigate the matter and may request the reporting party to furnish additional evidence of the alleged violation. if the administration is satisfied that sufficient evidence is available to enable proceedings to be brought in respect of the alleged violation, it shall cause such proceedings to be taken as soon as possible, in accordance with its law. the administration shall promptly inform the party that reported the alleged violation, as well as the organization, of any action taken. if the administration has not taken any action within 1 year after receiving the information, it shall so inform the party which reported the alleged violation.2 any violation of the requirements of this convention within the jurisdiction of any party shall be prohibited and sanctions shall be established under the law of that party. whenever such a violation occurs, that party shall either:(a) cause proceedings to be taken in accordance with its law; or(b) furnish to the administration of the ship such information and evidence as may be in its possession that a violation has occurred.3 the sanctions provided for by the laws of a party pursuant to this article shall be adequate in severity to discourage violations of this convention wherever they occur ARTICLE 9 inspection of ships1 a ship to which this convention applies may, in any port or offshore terminal of another party, be subject to inspection by officers duly authorized by that party for the purpose of determining whether the ship is in compliance with this convention. except as provided in paragraph 2 of this article, any such inspection is limited to:(a) verifying that there is onboard a valid certificate, which, if valid shall be accepted; and(b) inspection of the ballast water record book, and/or(c) a sampling of the ship's ballast water, carried out in accordance with the guidelines to be developed by the organization. however, the time required to analyse the samples shall not be used as a basis for unduly delaying the operation, movement or departure of the ship.2 where a ship does not carry a valid certificate or there are clear grounds for believing that:(a) the condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of the certificate; orthe master or the crew are not familiar with essential shipboard procedures relating to ballast water management, or have not implemented such procedures;a detailed inspection may be carried out.3 in the circumstances given in paragraph 2 of this article, the party carrying out the inspection shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship shall not discharge ballast water until it can do so without presenting a threat of harm to the environment, human health, property or resources ARTICLE 10 detection of violations and control of ships1 parties shall co-operate in the detection of violations and the enforcement of the provisions of this convention.2 if a ship is detected to have violated this convention, the party whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, and/or the party in whose port or offshore terminal the ship is operating, may, in addition to any sanctions described in article 8 or any action described in article 9, take steps to warn, detain, or exclude the ship. the party in whose port or offshore terminal the ship is operating, however, may grant such a ship permission to leave the port or offshore terminal for the purpose of discharging ballast water or proceeding to the nearest appropriate repair yard or reception facility available, provided doing so does not present a threat of harm to the environment, human health, property or resources.3 if the sampling described in article 9.1(c) leads to a result, or supports information received from another port or offshore terminal, indicating that the ship poses a threat to the environment, human health, property or resources, the party in whose waters the ship is operating shall prohibit such ship from discharging ballast water until the threat is removed.4 a party may also inspect a ship when it enters the ports or offshore terminals under its jurisdiction, if a request for an investigation is received from any party, together with sufficient evidence that a ship is operating or has operated in violation of a provision in this convention. the report of such investigation shall be sent to the party requesting it and to the competent authority of the administration of the ship concerned so that appropriate action may be taken ARTICLE 11 notification of control actions1 if an inspection conducted pursuant to article 9 or 10 indicates a violation of this convention, the ship shall be notified. a report shall be forwarded to the administration, including any evidence of the violation.2 in the event that any action is taken pursuant to article 9.3, 10.2 or 10.3, the officer carrying out such action shall forthwith inform, in writing, the administration of the ship concerned, or if this is not possible, the consul or diplomatic representative of the ship concerned, of all the circumstances in which the action was deemed necessary. in addition, the recognized organization responsible for the issue of certificates shall be notified.3 the port state authority concerned shall, in addition to parties mentioned in paragraph 2, notify the next port of call of all relevant information about the violation, if it is unable to take action as specified in article 9.3, 10.2 or 10.3 or if the ship has been allowed to proceed to the next port of call ARTICLE 12 undue delay to ships1 all possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained
