convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east atlanticsource: preamblethe contracting parties,recognising that the marine environment and the fauna and flora which it supports are of vital importance to all nations;recognising the inherent worth of the marine environment of the north-east atlantic and the necessity for providing coordinated protection for it;recognising that concerted action at national, regional and global levels is essential to prevent and eliminate marine pollution and to achieve sustainable management of the maritime area, that is, the management of human activities in such a manner that the marine ecosystem will continue to sustain the legitimate uses of the sea and will continue to meet the needs of present and future generations;mindful that the ecological equilibrium and the legitimate uses of the sea are threatened by pollution;considering the recommendations of the united nations conference on the human environment, held in stockholm in june 1972;considering also the results of the united nations conference on the environment and development held in rio de janeiro in june 1992;recalling the relevant provisions of customary international law reflected in part xii of the united nations law of the sea convention and, in particular, article 197 on global and regional cooperation for the protection and preservation of the marine environment;considering that the common interests of states concerned with the same marine area should induce them to cooperate at regional or sub-regional levels;recalling the positive results obtained within the context of the convention for the prevention of marine pollution by dumping from ships and aircraft signed in oslo on 15th february 1972, as amended by the protocols of 2nd march 1983 and 5th december 1989, and the convention for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources signed in paris on 4th june 1974, as amended by the protocol of 26th march 1986;convinced that further international action to prevent and eliminate pollution of the sea should be taken without delay, as part of progressive and coherent measures to protect the marine environment;recognising that it may be desirable to adopt, on the regional level, more stringent measures with respect to the prevention and elimination of pollution of the marine environment or with respect to the protection of the marine environment against the adverse effects of human activities than are provided for in international conventions or agreements with a global scope;recognising that questions relating to the management of fisheries are appropriately regulated under international and regional agreements dealing specifically with such questions;considering that the present oslo and paris conventions do not adequately control some of the many sources of pollution, and that it is therefore justifiable to replace them with the present convention, which addresses all sources of pollution of the marine environment and the adverse effects of human activities upon it, takes into account the precautionary principle and strengthens regional cooperation;have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of the convention:(a) "maritime area" means the internal waters and the territorial seas of the contracting parties, the sea

cooperate with competent regional organisations and other competent international organisations in carrying out quality status assessments ANNEX von the protection and conservation of the ecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area 2 ARTICLE 1for the purposes of this annex and of appendix 3 the definitions of biological diversity, ecosystem and habitat are those contained in the convention on biological diversity of 5 june 1992 ARTICLE 2in fulfilling their obligation under the convention to take, individually and jointly, the necessary measures to protect the maritime area against the adverse effects of human activities so as to safeguard human health and to conserve marine ecosystems and, when practicable, restore marine areas which have been adversely affected, as well as their obligation under the convention on biological diversity of 5 june 1992 to develop strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, contracting parties shall:a. take the necessary measures to protect and conserve the ecosystems and the biological diversity of the maritime area, and to restore, where practicable, marine areas which have been adversely affected; andb. cooperate in adopting programmes and measures for those purposes for the control of the human activities identified by the application of the criteria in appendix 3 ARTICLE 31. for the purposes of this annex, it shall inter alia be the duty of the commission:a. to draw up programmes and measures for the control of the human activities identified by the application of the criteria in appendix 3;b. in doing so:(i) to collect and review information on such activities and their effects on ecosystems and biological diversity;(ii) to develop means, consistent with international law, for instituting protective, conservation, restorative or precautionary measures related to specific areas or sites or related to particular species or habitats;(iii) subject to article 4 of this annex, to consider aspects of national strategies and guidelines on the sustainable use of components of biological diversity of the maritime area as they affect the various regions and sub-regions of that area;(iv) subject to article 4 of this annex, to aim for the application of an integrated ecosystem approach.c. also in doing so, to take account of programmes and measures adopted by contracting parties for the protection and conservation of ecosystems within waters under their sovereignty or jurisdiction.2. in the adoption of such programmes and measures, due consideration shall be given to the question whether any particular programme or measure should apply to all, or a specified part, of the maritime area ARTICLE 41. in accordance with the penultimate recital of the convention, no programme or measure concerning a question relating to the management of fisheries shall be adopted under this annex. however where the commission considers that action is desirable in relation to such a question, it shall draw that question to the attention of the authority or international body competent for that question. where action within the competence of the commission is desirable to complement or support action by those authorities or bodies, the commission shall endeavour to cooperate with them.2. where the commission considers that action under this annex is desirable in relation to a question concerning maritime transport, it shall draw that question to the attention of the international maritime organisation. the contracting parties who are members of the international maritime organisation shall endeavour to cooperate within that organisation in order to achieve an appropriate response, including in relevant cases that organisation s agreement to regional or local action, taking account of any guidelines developed by that organisation on the designation of special areas, the identification of particularly sensitive areas or other matters APPENDIX 1criteria for the definition of practices and techniques mentioned in paragraph 3(b)(i) of article 2 of the conventionbest available techniques1. the use of the best available techniques shall emphasise the use of non-waste technology, if available.2. the term "best available techniques" means the latest stage of development (state of the art) of processes, of facilities or of methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste. in determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of operation constitute the best available techniques in general or individual cases, special consideration shall be given to:(a) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have recently been successfully tried out;(b) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(c) the economic feasibility of such techniques;(d) time limits for installation in both new and existing plants;(e) the nature and volume of the discharges and emissions concerned.3. it therefore follows that what is "best available techniques" for a particular process will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.4. if the reduction of discharges and emissions resulting from the use of best available techniques does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.5. "techniques" include both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and dismantled.best environmental practice6. the term "best environmental practice" means the application of the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies. in making a selection for individual cases, at least the following graduated range of measures should be considered:(a) the provision of information and education to the public and to users about the environmental consequences of choice of particular activities and choice of products, their use and ultimate disposal;(b) the development and application of codes of good environmental practice which covers all aspect of the activity in the product's life;(c) the mandatory application of labels informing users of environmental risks related to a product, its use and ultimate disposal;(d) saving resources, including energy;(e) making collection and disposal systems available to the public;(f) avoiding the use of hazardous substances or products and the generation of hazardous waste;(g) recycling, recovery and re-use;(h) the application of economic instruments to activities, products or groups of products;(i) establishing a system of licensing, involving a range of restrictions or a ban.7. in determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practice, in general or individual cases, particular consideration should be given to:(a) the environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ultimate disposal;(b) the substitution by less polluting activities or substances;(c) the scale of use;(d) the potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute materials or activities;(e) advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(f) time limits for implementation;(g) social and economic implications.8. it therefore follows that best environmental practice for a particular source will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.9. if the reduction of inputs resulting from the use of best environmental practice does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied and best environmental practice redefined APPENDIX 2criteria mentioned in paragraph 2 of article 1 of annex i and in paragraph 2 of article 2 of annex iii1. when setting priorities and in assessing the nature and extent of the programmes and measures and their time scales, the contracting parties shall use the criteria given below:(a) persistency;(b) toxicity or other noxious properties;(c) tendency to bioaccumulation;(d) radioactivity;(e) the ratio between observed or (where the results of observations are not yet available) predicted concentrations and no observed effect concentrations;(f) anthropogenically caused risk of eutrophication;(g) transboundary significance;(h) risk of undesirable changes in the marine ecosystem and irreversibility or durability of effects;(i) interference with harvesting of sea-foods or with other legitimate uses of the sea;(j) effects on the taste and/or smell of products for human consumption from the sea, or effects on smell, colour, transparency or other characteristics of the water in the marine environment;(k) distribution pattern (i.e., quantities involved, use pattern and liability to reach the marine environment);(l) non-fulfilment of environmental quality objectives.2. these criteria are not necessarily of equal importance for the consideration of a particular substance or group of substances.3. the above criteria indicate that substances which shall be subject to programmes and measures include:(a) heavy metals and their compounds;(b) organohalogen compounds (and substances which may form such compounds in the marine environment);(c) organic compounds of phosphorus and silicon;(d) biocides such as pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, slimicides and chemicals used, inter alia, for the preservation of wood, timber, wood pulp, cellulose, paper, hides and textiles;(e) oils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin;(f) nitrogen and phosphorus compounds;(g) radioactive substances, including wastes;(h) persistent synthetic materials which may float, remain in suspension or sink APPENDIX 3criteria for identifying human activities for the purpose of annex v 31. the criteria to be used, taking into account regional differences, for identifying human activities for the purposes of annex v are:a. the extent, intensity and duration of the human activity under consideration;b. actual and potential adverse effects of the human activity on specific species, communities and habitats;c. actual and potential adverse effects of the human activity on specific ecological processes;d. irreversibility or durability of these effects.2. these criteria are not necessarily exhaustive or of equal importance for the consideration of a particular activity.
