amendments to annexes to the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter concerning incineration at seasource: b7 p. 972:96/athe third consultative meeting,recalling article i of the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, which provides that contracting parties shall individually and collectively promote the effective control of all sources of pollution of the marine environment,having noted the use of incineration at sea as a means of disposal of wastes containing highly toxic substances and the consequent risks of marine and atmospheric pollution which may result from this process,desiring to prevent such pollution and to minimize the risk of hazards to other vessels or interference with other legitimate uses of the sea which could arise from incineration operations at sea,recognizing present methods of incineration at sea as being an interim method of disposal of wastes pending the development of environmentally better solutions, considering at all times the best available technology,affirming that the intention of the adoption of mandatory provisions for the control of incineration at sea is not to increase the amounts and kinds of wastes or other matter incinerated at sea for which there are available practical alternative land-based methods of treatment, disposal or elimination,reaffirming that, in accordance with article iv(3) of the convention, contracting parties can apply additional regulations for incineration at sea on a national basis,noting that article viii of the convention encourages contracting parties, within the framework of regional conventions, to develop further agreements reflecting the conditions of the geographical area concernedrecalling the decision of the second consultative meeting that provisions for the control of incineration at sea should be implemented by contracting parties on a mandatory basis in the form of a legal instrument adopted within the framework of the convention (ldc ii/11, annex ii),having considered the proposed amendments to the annexes of the convention for the control of incineration at sea contained in the report of the ad hoc group of legal experts on dumping,adopts the following amendments to the annexes to the convention in accordance with articles xiv (4) (a) and xv (2) thereof:(a) addition of a paragraph 10 to annex i;(b) addition of a paragraph e to annex ii; and(c) addition of an addendum to annex i, containing regulations for the control of incineration of wastes and other matter at sea,the texts of which are set out in attachment to this resolution,entrusts the inter-governmental maritime consultative organization with the task of ensuring, in collaboration with the governments of france. spain, the union of soviet socialist republics and the united kingdom, that the texts of the above amendments are drawn up by 1 december 1978 in all official languages of the convention with the linguistic consistency in each text, which would then become the authentic text of the annexes to the convention in the english, french, russian and spanish languages,resolves that for the purposes of articles xiv (4) (a) and xv (2) of the convention, 1 december 1973 shall be treated as the date of the adoption of the amendments,requests the secretary-general of the organization to inform contracting parties of the above-mentioned amendments.requests the ad h group on incineration at sea to prepare draft technical guidelines for the control of incineration of wastes and other matter at sea with a view to adoption by the fourth consultative meeting,invites contracting parties to implement, as an interim measure, the existing technical guidelines [ldc 11/11, annex ii, with amendments (ias/9, annex iv)] and the notification procedure set out in annex 2 to ldc 111/12.amendments to annexes to the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter concerning incineration at seaattachmentthe following paragraph shall be added to annex i:10. paragraphs 1 and 5 of this annex do not apply to

regulations shall apply to the following wastes or other matter:(a) those referred to in paragraph 1 of annex i;(b) pesticides and their by-products not covered in annex i.(2) contracting parties shall first consider the practical availability of alternative land-based methods of treatment, disposal or elimination, or of treatment to render the wastes or other matter less harmful, before issuing a permit for incineration at sea in accordance with these regulations. incineration at sea shall in no way be interpreted as discouraging progress towards environmentally better solutions including the development of new techniques.(3) incineration at sea of wastes or other matter referred to in paragraph 10 of annex i and paragraph e of annex ii, other than those referred to in paragraph (1) of this regulation, shall be controlled to the satisfaction of the contracting party issuing the special permit.(4) incineration at sea of wastes or other matter not referred to in paragraphs (1) and (3) of this regulation shall be subject to a general permit.(5) in the issue of permits referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this regulation, the contracting parties shall take full account of all applicable provisions of these regulations and the technical guidelines on the control of incineration of waste and other matter at sea for the waste in question.part ii regulation 3approval and surveys of the incineration system(1) the incineration system for every proposed marine incineration facility shall be subject to the surveys specified below. in accordance with article vii(1) of the convention, the contracting party which proposes to issue an incineration permit shall ensure that the surveys of the marine incineration facility to be used have been completed and the incineration system complies with the provisions of these regulations. if the initial survey is carried out under the direction of a contracting party a special permit, which specifies the testing

tests shall be undertaken.(2) where a contracting party proposes to permit incineration of wastes or other matter over which doubts as to the efficiency of combustion exist, the incineration system shall be subject to the same intensive stack monitoring as required for the initial incineration system survey. consideration shall be given to the sampling of particulates, taking into account the solid content of the wastes.(3) the minimum approved flame temperature shall be that specified in regulation 5 unless the results of tests on the marine incineration facility demonstrate that the
