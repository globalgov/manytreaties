protocol for the protection of the mediterranean sea against pollution from land-based sourcessource: the contracting parties to the present protocol,being parties to the convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea against pollution, adopted at barcelona on 16 february 1976,desirous of implementing article 4, paragraph 2, and articles 8 and 15 of the said convention,noting the rapid increase of human activities in the mediterranean sea area, particularly in the fields of industrialization and urbanization, as well as the seasonal increase in the coastal population due to tourism,recognizing the danger posed to the marine environment and to human health by pollution from land-based sources and the serious problems resulting therefrom in many coastal waters and river estuaries of the mediterranean sea, primarily due to the release of untreated, insufficiently treated or inadequately disposed of domestic or industrial discharges,recognizing the difference in levels of development between the coastal states, and taking account of the economic and social imperatives of the developing countries,determined to take in close co-operation the necessary measures to protect the mediterranean sea against pollution from land-based sources,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1the contracting parties to this protocol (hereinafter referred to as "the parties") shall take all appropriate measures to prevent, abate, combat and control pollution of the mediterranean sea area caused by discharges from rivers, coastal establishments or outfalls, or emanating from any other land-based sources within their territories ARTICLE 2for the purposes of this protocol:(a) "the convention" means the convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea against pollution, adopted at barcelona on 16 february 1976;(b) "organization" means the body referred to in article 13 of the convention;(c) "freshwater limit" means the place in watercourses where, at low tides and in a period of low freshwater flow, there is an appreciable increase in salinity due to the presence of sea-water ARTICLE 3the area to which this protocol applies (hereinafter referred to as the "protocol area") shall be:(a) the mediterranean sea area as defined in article 1 of the convention;(b) waters on the landward side of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured and extending in the case of watercourses up to the freshwater limit;(c) saltwater marshes communicating with the sea ARTICLE 41. this protocol shall apply:(a) to polluting discharges reaching the protocol area from land-based sources within the territories of the parties, in particular: directly, from outfalls discharging into the sea or through coastal disposal; indirectly, through rivers, canals or other watercourses, including underground watercourses, or through run-off;(b) to pollution from land-based sources transported by the atmosphere, under conditions to be defined in an additional annex to this protocol and accepted by the parties in conformity with the provisions of article 17 of the convention.2. this protocol shall also apply to polluting discharges from fixed man-made offshore structures which are under the jurisdiction of a party and which serve purposes other than exploration and exploitation of mineral resources of the continental shelf an d the sea-bed and its subsoil ARTICLE 51. the parties undertake to eliminate pollution of the protocol area from land-based sources by substances listed in annex i to this protocol.2. to this end they shall elaborate and implement, jointly or individually, as appropriate, the necessary programmes and measures.3. these programmes and measures shall include, in particular, common emission standards and standards for use.4. the standards and the time-tables for the implementation of the programmes and measures aimed at eliminating pollution from land-based sources shall be fixed by the parties and periodically reviewed, if necessary every two years, for each of the substances listed in annex i, in accordance with the provisions of article 15 of this protocol ARTICLE 61. the parties shall strictly limit pollution from land-based sources in the protocol area by substances or sources listed in annex ii to this protocol.2. to this end they shall elaborate and implement jointly or individually, as appropriate, suitable programmes and measures.3. discharges shall be strictly subject to the issue, by the competent national authorities, of an authorization taking due account of the provisions of annex iii to this protocol ARTICLE 71. the parties shall progressively formulate and adopt, in co-operation with the competent international organizations, common guidelines and, as appropriate, standards or criteria dealing in particular with:(a) the length, depth and position of pipelines for coastal outfalls, taking into account, in particular, the methods used for pretreatment of effluents;(b) special requirements for effluents necessitating separate treatment;(c) the quality of sea-water used for specific purposes that is necessary for the protection of human health, living resources and ecosystems;(d) the control and progressive replacement of products, installations and industrial and other processes causing significant pollution of the marine environment;(e) specific requirements concerning the quantities of the substances listed in annexes i and ii discharged, their concentration in effluents and methods of discharging them.2. without prejudice to the provisions of article 5 of this protocol, such common guidelines, standards or criteria shall take into account local ecological, geographical and physical characteristics, the economic capacity of the parties and their need for development, the level of existing pollution and the real absorptive capacity of the marine environment.3. the programmes and measures referred to

programmes of assistance to developing countries, particularly in the fields of science, education and technology, with a view to preventing pollution from land-based sources and its harmful effects in the marine environment.2. technical assistance would include, in particular, the training of scientific and technical personnel, as well as the acquisition, utilization and production by those countries of appropriate equipment on advantageous terms to be agreed upon among the parties concerned ARTICLE 111. if discharges from a watercourse which flows through the territories of two or more parties or forms a boundary between them are likely to cause pollution of the marine environment of the protocol area, the parties in question, respecting the provision s of this protocol in so far as each of them is concerned, are called upon to co-operate with a view to ensuring its full application.2. a party shall not be responsible for any pollution originating on the territory of a non-contracting state. however, the said party shall endeavour to cooperate with the said state so as to make possible full application of the protocol ARTICLE 121. taking into account article 22,
