agreement on the conservation of african-eurasian migratory waterbirdssource: the contracting parties,recalling that the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals, 1979, encourages international cooperative action to conserve migratory species;recalling further that the first meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention, held in bonn in october 1985, instructed the secretariat of the convention to take appropriate measures to develop an agreement on western palearctic anatidae;considering that migratory waterbirds constitute an important part of the global biological diversity which, in keeping with the spirit of the convention on biological diversity, 1992, and agenda 21 should be conserved for the benefit of present and future generations;aware of the economic, social, cultural and recreational benefits accruing from the taking of certain species of migratory waterbirds and of the environmental, ecological, genetic, scientific, aesthetic, recreational, cultural, educational, social and economic values of waterbirds in general;convinced that any taking of migratory waterbirds must be conducted on a sustainable basis, taking into account the conservation status of the species concerned over their entire range as well as their biological characteristics;conscious that migratory waterbirds are particularly vulnerable because they migrate over long distances and are dependent on networks of wetlands that are decreasing in extent and becoming degraded through non-sustainable human activities, as is expressed in the convention on wetlands of international importance, especially as waterfowl habitat, 1971;recognizing the need to take immediate action to stop the decline of migratory waterbird species and their habitats in the geographic area of the african-eurasian waterbird migration systems;convinced that the conclusion of a multilateral agreement and its implementation through coordinated or concerted action will contribute significantly to the conservation of migratory waterbirds and their habitats in the most efficient manner, and will have ancillary benefits for many other species of animals and plants; andacknowledging that effective implementation of such an agreement will require assistance to be provided to some range states for research, training and monitoring of migratory waterbird species and their habitats, for the management of those habitats as well as for the establishment or improvement of scientific and administrative institutions for the implementation of this agreement,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE iscope, definitions and interpretation1. the geographic scope of this agreement is the area of the migration systems of

available.4.3.2 parties shall endeavour to gather information on the damage, in particular to crops, caused by populations listed in table 1, and report the results to the agreement secretariat.4.3.3 parties shall cooperate with a view to identifying appropriate techniques to minimize damage, or to mitigate the effects of damage, in particular to crops, caused by populations listed in table 1, drawing on the experience gained elsewhere in the world.4.3.4 parties shall cooperate with a view to developing single species action plans for populations which cause significant damage, in particular to crops. the agreement secretariat shall coordinate the development and harmonization of such plans.4.3.5 parties shall, as far as possible, promote high environmental standards in the planning and construction of structures to minimize their impact on populations listed in table 1. they should consider steps to minimize the impact of structures already in existence where it becomes evident that they constitute a negative impact for the populations concerned.4.3.6 in cases where human disturbance threatens the conservation status of waterbird populations listed in table 1, parties should endeavour to take measures to limit the level of threat. appropriate measures might include, inter alia, the establishment of disturbance-free zones in protected areas where public access is not permitted.5. research and monitoring5.1 parties shall endeavour to carry out survey work in poorly known areas, which may hold important concentrations of the populations listed in table 1. the results of such surveys shall be disseminated widely.5.2 parties shall endeavour to monitor the populations listed in table 1. the results of such monitoring shall be published or sent to appropriate international organizations, to enable reviews of population status and trends.5.3 parties shall cooperate to improve the measurement of bird population trends as a criterion for describing the status of such populations.5.4 parties shall cooperate with a view to determining the migration routes of all populations listed in table 1, using available knowledge of breeding and non-breeding season distributions and census results, and by participating in coordinated ringing programmes.5.5 parties shall endeavour to initiate and support joint research projects into the ecology and population dynamics of populations listed in table 1 and their habitats, in order to determine their specific requirements as well as the techniques which are the most appropriate for their conservation and management.5.6 parties shall endeavour to undertake studies on the effects of wetland loss and degradation and disturbance on the carrying capacity of wetlands used by the populations listed in table 1 and on the migration patterns of such populations.5.7 parties shall endeavour to undertake studies on the impact of hunting and trade on the populations listed in table 1 and on the importance of these forms of utilization to the local and national economy.5.8 parties shall endeavour to cooperate with relevant international organisations and to support research and monitoring projects.6. education and information6.1 parties shall, where necessary, arrange for training programmes to ensure that personnel responsible for the implementation of this action plan have an adequate knowledge to implement it effectively.6.2 parties shall cooperate with each other and the agreement secretariat with a view to developing training programmes and exchanging resource materials.6.3 parties shall endeavour to develop programmes, information materials and mechanisms to improve the level of awareness of the general public with regard to the objectives, provisions and contents of this action plan. in this regard, particular attention shall be given to those people living in and around important wetlands, to users of these wetlands (hunters, fishermen, tourists, etc.) and to local authorities and other decision makers.6.4 parties shall endeavour to undertake specific public awareness campaigns for the conservation of the populations listed in table 1.7. implementation7.1 when implementing this action plan, parties shall, when appropriate, give priority to those populations listed in column a of table 1.7.2 where, in the case of populations listed in table 1, more than one population of the same species occurs on the territory of a party, that party shall apply conservation measures appropriate to the population or populations that have the poorest conservation status.7.3 the agreement secretariat, in coordination with the technical committee and with the assistance of experts from range states, shall coordinate the development of conservation guidelines in accordance with article iv, paragraph 4, of this agreement to assist the parties in the implementation of this action plan. the agreement secretariat shall ensure, where possible, coherence with guidelines approved under other international instruments. these conservation guidelines shall aim at introducing the principle of sustainable use. they shall cover, inter alia:(a) single species action plans;(b) emergency measures;(c) preparation of site inventories and habitat management methods;(d) hunting practices;(e) trade in waterbirds;(f) tourism;(g) reducing crop damage; and(h) a waterbird monitoring protocol.7.4 the agreement secretariat, in coordination with the technical committee and the parties, shall prepare a series of international reviews necessary for the implementation of this action plan, including:(a) reports on the status and trends of populations;(b) gaps in information from surveys;(c) the networks of sites used by each population, including reviews of the protection status of each site as well as of the management measures taken in each case;(d) pertinent hunting and trade legislation in each country relating to the species listed in annex 2 to this agreement;(e) the stage of preparation and implementation of single species action plans;(f) re-establishment projects; and(g) the status of introduced non-native waterbird species and hybrids thereof.7.5 the agreement secretariat shall endeavour to ensure that the reviews mentioned in paragraph 7.4 are updated at intervals of not more than three years.7.6 the technical committee shall assess the guidelines and reviews prepared under paragraphs 7.3 and 7.4, and shall formulate draft recommendations and resolutions relating to their development, content and implementation for consideration at sessions of the meeting of the parties.7.7 the agreement secretariat shall regularly undertake a review of potential mechanisms for providing additional resources (funds and technical assistance) for the implementation of this action plan, and shall make a report to each ordinary session of the meeting of the parties.table 1status of the populations of migratory waterbirdskey to classificationthe following key to table 1 is a basis for implementation of the action plan:column acategory 1:(a) species which are included in appendix i to the convention;(b) species which are listed as threatened in the 1994 iucn red list of threatened animals (groombridge 1993); or(c) populations which number less than around 10,000 individuals.category 2: populations numbering between around 10,000 and around 25,000 individuals.category 3: populations numbering between around 25,000 and around 100,000 individuals and considered to be at risk as a result of:(a) concentration onto a small number of sites at any stage of their annual cycle;(b) dependence on a habitat type which is under severe threat;(c) showing significant long-term decline; or(d) showing extreme fluctuations in population size or trend.for species listed in categories 2 and 3, above, see paragraph 2.1.1 of this annex.column bcategory 1: populations numbering between around 25,000 and around 100,000 individuals and which do not fulfill the conditions in respect of column a, as described above.category 2: populations numbering more than around 100,000 individuals and considered to be in need of special attention as a result of:(a) concentration onto a small number of sites at any stage of their annual cycle;(b) dependence on a habitat type which is under severe threat;(c) showing significant long-term decline; or(d) showing large fluctuations in population size or trend.column ccategory 1: populations numbering more than around 100,000 individuals which could significantly benefit from international cooperation and which do not fulfill the conditions in respect of either column a or b, above.reviewthis table shall be:(a) reviewed regularly by the technical committee in accordance with article vii, paragraph 3(b), of this agreement; and(b) amended as necessary by the meeting of the parties, in accordance with article vi, paragraph 9(d) of
