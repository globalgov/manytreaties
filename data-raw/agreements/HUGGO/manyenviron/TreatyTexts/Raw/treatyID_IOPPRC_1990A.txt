international convention on oil pollution preparedness, response and co-operation, 1990source: the parties to the present convention,conscious of the need to preserve the human environment in general and the marine environment in particular,recognizing the serious threat posed to the marine environment by oil pollution incidents involving ships, offshore units, sea ports and oil handling facilities,mindful of the importance of precautionary measures and prevention in avoiding oil pollution in the first instance, and the need for strict application of existing international instruments dealing with maritime safety and marine pollution prevention, particularly the international convention for the safety of life at sea, 1974,[1] as amended, and the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, 1973, as modified by the protocol of 1978 relating thereto,[2] as amended, and also the speedy development of enhanced standards for the design, operation and maintenance of ships carrying oil, and of offshore units,mindful also that, in the event of an oil pollution incident, prompt and effective action is essential in order to minimize the damage which may result from such an incident,emphasizing the importance of effective preparation for combating oil pollution incidents and the important role which the oil and shipping industries have in this regard,recognizing further the importance of mutual assistance and international co-operation relating to matters including the exchange of information respecting the capabilities of states to respond to oil pollution incidents, the preparation of oil pollution contingency plans, the exchange of reports of incidents of significance which may affect the marine environment or the coastline and related interests of states, and research and development respecting means of combating oil pollution in the marine environment,taking account of the "polluter pays" principle as a general principle of international environmental law,taking account also of the importance of international instruments on liability and compensation for oil pollution damage, including the 1969 international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage (clc);[3] and the 1971 international convention on the establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage (fund);[4] and the compelling need for early entry into force of the 1984 protocols to the clc and fund conventions,taking account further of the importance of bilateral and multilateral agreements and arrangements including regional conventions and agreements,bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the united nations convention on the law of the sea,[5] in particular of its part xii,being aware of the need to promote international co-operation and to enhance existing national, regional and global capabilities concerning oil pollution preparedness and response, taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and particularly small island states,considering that these objectives may best be achieved by the conclusion of an international convention on oil pollution
