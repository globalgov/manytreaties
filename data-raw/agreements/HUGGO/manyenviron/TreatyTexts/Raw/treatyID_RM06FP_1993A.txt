regional convention for the management and conservation of the natural forest ecosystems and the development of forest plantations (spanish title: convenio para el manejo y la conservacion de los ecosistemas naturales forestales y el desarrollo de plantaciones forestales)source: the ministers of foreign affairs of the republics of costa rica, el salvador, guatemala, honduras, nicaragua and panamaconsidering:that the tegucigalpa protocol, which institutes the central american integration system (sica) reaffirms, among its objectives "to establish concerted actions directed to the preservation of the environment through respect and harmony with nature, ensuring a balanced development and rational exploitation of the region's natural resources with the perspective to establish a new ecological order in the region."that the forestry development potential of central america is based on its existing 19 million hectares of natural forests and in its 13 million hectares of lands with forestry potential that are presently without forests;that the wealth and diversity of the different life zones and species found in the region's tropical forests, linked to its isthmic nature, as a bridge between the continental masses of north and south america, make this central american region the most important deposit of genetic wealth and biological diversity in the world;that, in contrast with this wealth, there is another reality: at present, more than 20 million central americans live in poverty conditions, particularly those 14 million that live in extreme poverty conditions since they cannot even satisfy their basic needs of nutrition. it is important to point out that two thirds of the poor live in rural areas;that, every day, in the region, it becomes more evident that poverty worsens forest and local environmental degradation, and increases even more with the external debt and the loss in the terms of exchange, all products of an unbalanced growth in the previous decades;the in the rural sector, the concentration of land is even greater than what the indices show since, frequently, the best lands are occupied by those that have the means and technology to exploit them, relegating the poor to poor quality land, basically on the hill sides. this is the habitual cause for deforestation and the high levels of erosion and soil loss observed in the region, which lead to an even greater empoverishment of those who work these areas;that a frontal attack on poverty is a fundamental part of the restructuring and modernizing strategies of the economy.this strategy requires the massive incorporation of technical progress in productive efficiency and greater social equity, to increase the quality of life of this poor majority, and to facilitate and support their absolute access to the productive and investment processes and to increase their productive performance;that forest resources which cover 45% of the regional territory, and the soils with forestry potential, which add up[missing pages 2-4]nongovernmental organizations, and individuals, and the inhabitants of forested areas, in the planning, implementation and evaluation of national policy resultant from this convention.b. recognize and duly support the cultural diversity, respecting the rights, obligations and needs of indigenous peoples, their communities and those of the other inhabitants of forested areas ARTICLE vinstitutional strengthening ARTICLE 6the contracting states of the present convention must:a. strengthen the sectorial and inter-sectorial

protection and improvement of the forest resource.d. create, by law, through the respective legislative powers, the obligation to carry out environmental impact studies in forest areas where large scale forestry concessions, or other economic activities are being proposed, that may have a negative impact on the forest.e. profit from the comparative advantages of each country, propitiating their transfer to the rest of the countries.f. strengthen the region's technical capacity through training and applied research programs, and the promotion of forestry techniques in productive and planning activities.g. data on infrastructure and necessary means to ensure quantity and quality of forestry seeds that may be needed.h. data on the personnel necessary for the vigilance and conservation of national forests ARTICLE viregional coordination ARTICLE 7the central american commission on environment and development (ccad) is instructed to implement a central american council on forests in
