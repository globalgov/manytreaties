[note: refer to the imdg code adopted by the organization by resolution msc.122(75), as amended by the maritime safety committee.]4 for the purposes of this annex, empty packagings which have been used previously for the carriage of harmful substances shall themselves be treated as harmful substances unless adequate precautions have been taken to ensure that they contain no residue that is harmful to the marine environment.5 the requirements of this annex do not apply to ship's stores and equipment.regulation 2packingpackages shall be adequate to minimize the hazard to the marine environment, having regard to their specific contents.regulation 3marking and labelling1 packages containing a harmful substance shall be durably marked or labelled to indicate that the substance is a harmful substance in accordance with the relevant provisions of the imdg code.2 the method of affixing marks or labels on packages containing a harmful substance shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the imdg code.regulation 4[note: reference to "documents" in this regulation does not preclude the use of electronic data processing (edp) and electronic data interchange (edi) transmission techniques as an aid to paper documentation.]documentation1 transport information relating to the carriage of harmful substances shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the imdg code and shall be made available to the person or organization designated by the port state authority.2 each ship carrying harmful substances shall have a special list, manifest or stowage plan setting forth, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the imdg code, the harmful substances on board and the location thereof. a copy of one of these documents shall be made available before departure to the person or organization designated by the port state authority.regulation 5stowageharmful substances shall be properly stowed and secured so as to minimize the hazards to the marine environment without impairing the safety of the ship and persons on board.regulation 6quantity limitationscertain harmful substances may, for sound scientific and technical reasons, need to be prohibited for carriage or be limited as to the quantity which may be carried aboard any one ship. in limiting the quantity, due consideration shall be given to size, construction and equipment of the ship, as well as the packaging and the inherent nature of the substances.regulation 7exceptions1 jettisoning of harmful substances carried in packaged form shall be prohibited, except where necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of the ship or saving life at sea.2 subject to the provisions of the present convention, appropriate measures based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of harmful substances shall be taken to regulate the washing of leakages overboard, provided that compliance with such measures would not impair the safety of the ship and persons on board.regulation 8port state control on operational requirements [note: refer to the procedures for port state control adopted by the organization by resolution a.787(19) and amended by resolution a.882(21).]1 a ship when in a port or an offshore terminal of another party is subject to inspection by officers duly authorized by such party concerning operational requirements under this annex.2 where there are clear grounds for believing that the master or crew are not familiar with essential shipboard procedures relating to the prevention of pollution by harmful substances, the party shall take such steps, including carrying out detailed inspection and, if required, will ensure that the ship shall not sail until the situation has been brought to order in accordance with the requirements of this annex.3 procedures relating to the port state control prescribed in article 5 of the present convention shall apply to this regulation.4 nothing in this regulation shall be construed to limit the rights and obligations of a party carrying out control over operational requirements specifically provided for in the present convention APPENDIX to annex iiicriteria for the identification of harmful substances in packaged formfor the purposes of this annex, substances identified by any one of the following criteria are harmful substances [note: the criteria are based on those developed by the united nations globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals (ghs), as amended. for definitions of acronyms or terms used in this appendix, refer to the relevant paragraphs of the imdg code.]:(a) acute (short-term) aquatic hazardcategory: acute 196 hr lc50 (for fish)  1 mg/l and/or 48 hr ec50 (for crustacea)  1 mg/l and/or 72 or 96 hr erc50 (for algae or

code.
