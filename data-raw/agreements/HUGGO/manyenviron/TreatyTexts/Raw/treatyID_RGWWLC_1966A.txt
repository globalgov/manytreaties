parties, by the president of the european court of human rights.(5) if, in one of the cases referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4), the president of the european court of human rights is unable to perform the function in question or is a national of one of the riparian states, the designation shall be made by the vice-president. if the latter is also unable to perform that function or is a national of one of the riparian states, the designation shall be made by the most senior member of the court who is not a national of one of the riparian states ARTICLE 11(1) the arbitration commission shall endeavour, at every stage of the proceedings, to bring about an amicable settlement of the case. if it does not prove possible to achieve such a settlement, the commission shall adopt a decision by majority vote. the said decision shall be final and shall be binding upon all the riparian states.(2) the arbitration commission shall base its proposals for a settlement and its

suffer adverse effects as a result of the utilization of the water in question when there is not a sufficient causal link between the adverse effects and the actual withdrawal of the water. thus, for
