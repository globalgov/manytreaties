protocol for the prevention of pollution of the south pacific region by dumpingsource: the parties to the protocol,being parties to the convention for the protection of the natural resources and environment of the south pacific region, adopted in noumea, new caledonia on the twenty-fourth day of november in the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six;recognizing the danger posed to the marine environment by pollution caused by the dumping of waste or other matter;considering that they have a common interest to protect the south pacific region from this danger, taking into account the unique environmental quality of the region;desiring to enter into a regional agreement consistent with the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, 1972 as provided in article viii thereof according to which the contracting parties to that convention have undertaken to endeavour to act consistently with the objectives and provisions of such regional agreement;have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purpose of this protocol "convention" means the convention for the protection of the natural resources and environment of the south pacific region adopted in noumea, new caledonia on the twenty-fourth day of november in the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-six ARTICLE 2geographical coveragethe area to which this protocol applies, hereinafter referred to as the "protocol area", shall be the convention area as defined in article 2 of the convention together with the continental shelf of a party where it extends, in accordance with international law, outward beyond the convention area ARTICLE 3general obligations1. the parties shall take all appropriate measures to prevent, reduce and control pollution in the protocol area by dumping.2. dumping within the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone or onto the continental shelf of a party as defined in international law shall not be carried out without the express prior approval of that party, which has the right to permit, regulate and control such dumping taking fully into account the provisions of this protocol, and after due consideration of the matter with other parties which by reason of their geographical situation may be adversely affected thereby.3. national laws, regulations and measures adopted by the parties shall be no less effective in preventing, reducing and controlling pollution by dumping than the relevant internationally recognized rules and procedures relating to the control of dumping established within the framework of the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, 1972 ARTICLE 4prohibited substances1. the dumping in the protocol area of wastes or other matter listed in annex i to this protocol is prohibited except as provided in this protocol.2. no provision of this protocol is to be interpreted as preventing a party from prohibiting, insofar as that party is concerned the dumping of wastes or other matter not mentioned in annex i. that party shall notify such measures to the organisation ARTICLE 5special permitsthe dumping in the protocol area of wastes or other matter listed in annex ii to this protocol requires, in each case, a prior special permit ARTICLE 6general permitsthe dumping in the protocol area of all wastes or other matter not listed in annexes i and ii to this protocol requires a prior general permit ARTICLE 7factors governing the issue of permitsthe permits referred to in articles 5 and 6 shall be issued only after careful consideration of all the factors set forth in annex iii to this protocol. the organisation shall receive records of such permits ARTICLE 8allocation of substances to annexessubstances are allocated to annexes i and ii of this protocol in accordance with annex iv ARTICLE 9force majeurethe provisions of articles 4, 5 and 6 shall not apply when it is necessary to secure the safety of human life or of vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea in cases of force majeure caused by stress of weather, or in any case which constitutes a danger to human life or a real threat to vessels, aircraft, platforms, or other man-made structures at sea, if dumping appears to be the only way of averting the threat and if there is every probability that the damage consequent upon such dumping will be less than would otherwise occur. such dumping shall be so conducted as to minimise the likelihood of damage to human or marine life. such dumping shall immediately be reported to the organisation and, either through the organisation or directly, to any party or parties likely to be affected, together with full details of the circumstances and of the nature and quantities of the wastes or other matter dumped ARTICLE 10emergencies1. a party may issue a special permit as an exception to article 4, in emergencies arising in the protocol area, posing unacceptable risk relating to human health and admitting no other feasible solution. before doing so the party shall consult any other country or countries that are likely to be affected and the organisation which, after consulting other parties, and international organisations as appropriate, shall in accordance with article 15 promptly recommend to the party the most appropriate procedures to adopt. the party shall follow these recommendations to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the time within which action must be taken and with the general obligation to avoid damage to the marine environment and shall inform the organisation of the action it takes. the parties pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations.2. this article does not apply with respect to

hundred and eighty-six, in a single copy in the english and french languages, the two texts being equally authentic ANNEX ia. the following substances and materials are listed for the purposes of article 4 of this protocol:1. organohalogen compounds.2. mercury and mercury compounds.3. cadmium and cadmium compounds.4. persistent plastics and other persistent synthetic materials, for example, netting and ropes, which may remain in suspension in the sea in such a manner as to interfere materially with fishing, navigation or other legitimate uses of the sea.5. crude oil and its wastes, refined petroleum products, petroleum distillate residues and any mixtures containing any of these taken on board for the purpose of dumping.6. materials in whatever form (e.g. solids, liquids, semi-liquids, gases, or in a living state) produced for biological and chemical warfare.7. organosphosphorous compounds.b. section a does not apply to substances, other than substances produced for biological or chemical warfare, which are rapidly rendered harmless by physical, chemical or biological processes in the sea provided they do not:- make edible marine organisms unpalatable, or- endanger human health or that of marine biota.the consultative procedure provided for under article 10 shall be followed by a party if there is doubt about the harmlessness of the substance.c. this annex does not apply to wastes or other materials, such as sewage sludges and dredged spoils, containing the matters referred to in paragraphs 1-5 of section a as trace contaminants. the dumping of such wastes shall be subject to the provisions of annexes ii and iii as appropriate ANNEX iithe following substances and materials requiring special care are listed for the purposes of article 5 of this protocol.a. wastes containing a significant amount of the matters listed below:arsenic) lead ) and their compounds copper ) zinc )organosilicon compounds cyanides fluorides pesticides and their by-products not covered in annex i.b. in the issue of permits for the dumping of acids and alkalis, consideration shall be given to the possible presence in such wastes of the substances listed in section a and to the following additional substances:beryllium ) chromium)and their compounds nickel) vanadium)c. containers, scrap metal and other bulky wastes liable to sink to the sea bottom which may present a serious obstacle to fishing or navigation.d. substances which, though of a non-toxic nature, may become harmful due to the quantities in which they are dumped, or which are liable to seriously reduce amenities ANNEX iiiprovisions to be considered in establishing criteria governing the issue of permits for the dumping of matter at sea, taking into account article 7 of this protocol, include:a. characteristics and composition of the matter1. total amount and average composition of matter dumped (e.g. per year).2. form (e.g. solid, sludge, liquid, or gaseous).3. properties: physical (e.g. solubility and density), chemical and biochemical (e.g. oxygen demand, nutrients) and biological (e.g. presence of viruses, bacteria, yeasts, parasites).4. toxicity.5. persistence: physical, chemical and biological.6. accumulation and biotransformation in biological materials or sediments.7. susceptibility to physical, chemical and biochemical changes and interaction in the aquatic environment with other dissolved organic and inorganic materials.8. probability of production of taints or other changes reducing marketability of resources (e.g. fish, shellfish, etc.).9. in issuing a permit for dumping, parties should consider whether an adequate scientific basis and sufficient knowledge of the composition and characteristics of the wastes or other matter proposed for dumping exist for assessing the impact of such material on the marine environment and human health.b characteristics of dumping site and method of deposit1. location (e.g. co-ordinates of the dumping area, depth and distance from the coast), location in relation to other areas (e.g. amenity areas, spawning, nursery and fishing areas and exploitable resources).2. rate of disposal per specific period (e.g. quantity per day, per week, per month).3 methods of packaging and containment, if any.4. initial dilution achieved by proposed methods of release.5. dispersal characteristics (e.g. effects of currents, tides and wind on horizontal transport and vertical mixing).6. water characteristics (e.g. temperature, ph, salinity, stratification, oxygen indices of pollution, dissolved oxygen (do), chemical oxygen demand (cod), biochemical oxygen demand (bod), nitrogen present in organic and mineral form including ammonia, suspended matter, other nutrients and productivity).7. bottom characteristics (e.g. topography, geochemical and geological characteristics and biological productivity).8. existence and effects of other dumpings which have been made in the dumping area (e.g. heavy metal background reading and organic carbon content).9. in issuing a permit for dumping, parties should consider whether an adequate scientific basis exists for assessing the consequences of such dumping, as outlined in this annex taking into account seasonal variations.c. general considerations and conditions1. possible effects on amenities (e.g. presence of floating or stranded materials, turbidity, objectionable odour, discolouration and foaming).2. possible effects on marine life, fish and shellfish culture, fish stocks and fisheries, seaweed harvesting and culture.3. possible effects on other uses of the sea (e.g. impairment of water quality for industrial use, underwater corrosion of structure, interference with ship operations from floating materials, interference with fishing or navigation through deposit of waste or solid objects on the sea floor and protection of areas of special importance of scientific or conservation purposes).4. the practical availability of alternative land-based methods of treatment, disposal or elimination, or of treatment to render the matter less harmful for dumping at sea.d. referencesreference should also be made to "guidelines for the implementation and uniform interpretation of annex iii" as adopted by the consultative meeting of contracting parties to the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, 1972 ANNEX ivallocation of substances to annexes1. substances are allocated to annexes i and ii on the ground of any combination of the following criteria:persistence and degradability, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity to marine life, toxicity to man, domestic animals, marine mammals and birds preying on marine organisms, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, ability to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea.2 ANNEX i substances are those which have a high degree of persistence coupled with:(a) the ability to accumulate to harmful levels in terms of toxicity to marine organisms and their predators, to domestic animals or to man; or(b) the ability to accumulate through marine pathways to levels harmful in terms of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity to domestic animals or to man; or(c) the ability to cause interference with fisheries, amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea.3 ANNEX ii substances are all those considered suitable for inclusion in annexes except for those allocated to annex i.
