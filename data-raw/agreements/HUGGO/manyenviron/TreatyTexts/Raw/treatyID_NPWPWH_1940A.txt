any agency within man's control; andwishing to protect and preserve scenery of extraordinary beauty, unusual and striking geologic formations, regions and natural objects of aesthetic, historic or scientific value, and areas characterized by primitive conditions in those cases covered by this convention; andwishing to conclude a convention on the protection of nature and the preservation of flora and fauna to effectuate the foregoing purposes have agreed upon the following articles: ARTICLE idescription of terms used in the wording of this convention1. the expression national parks shall

animal and plant life will be afforded in so far as this may be consistent with the primary purpose of such reserves.3. the expression nature monuments shall denote:regions, objects, or living species of flora and fauna of aesthetic, historic or scientific interest to which strict protection is given. the purpose of nature monuments is the protection of a specific object, or a species of flora or fauna, by setting aside an area, an object, or a single species, as an inviolate nature monument, except for duly authorized scientific investigations or government inspection.4. the expression strict
