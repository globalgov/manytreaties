amendment and adoption of annexes to the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal of 22 march 1989source: decision adopted as decision iv/9 by the fourth meeting of the conference of the parties to the basel convention.the conferencerecalling decision iii/1 of the conference of the parties, which instructed the technical working group, among other things, to give full priority to completing the work on hazard characterization and the development of lists, in order to submit them for approval to the fourth meeting of the conference of the parties,recalling decision iii/12 of the conference of the parties, which instructed the technical working group, among other things, to consider ways of taking forward the development of lists of hazardous wastes and the applicable procedure for their review based on the outcome of the work of the technical working group, as well as further developing lists of wastes not covered by this convention,taking note of the work carried out by the technical working group and in particular the development of a list of wastes that are characterized as hazardous pursuant to article 1, paragraph 1(a), (list a contained in the note on consolidated lists of wastes and the applicable procedures for their review and adjustment (unep/chw.4/3)) and a list of wastes that are not covered by article 1, paragraph 1(a), of this convention (list b contained in the note in consolidated lists of wastes and the applicable procedures for their review and adjustment), as well as the progress made in the development of a procedure for reviewing or adjusting these lists and of an application form required for the placement or removal of wastes on these lists,considering that annex i and annex iii shall remain the factors to characterize wastes as hazardous for the purpose of this convention, that lists a and b developed by the technical working group provide an expeditious way to facilitate the implementation of this convention, including article 4a, by establishing wastes that are and wastes that are not covered by article 1, paragraph 1(a), of this convention, and that these lists should have equal status,noting that wastes listed in lists a and b are an elaboration and clarification of the provisions of article 1, paragraph 1(a), of this convention by reference to annexes i and iii,recognizing that list a and list b are not intended to be exhaustive,taking note that the open-ended ad hoc committee decided at its third meeting to propose that the conference of the parties extend the mandate of the technical working group to take charge of the procedure for reviewing or adjusting the lists of wastes and that the conference of the parties adopt the application form for this purpose, as set out in the note on consolidated lists of wastes and the applicable procedures for their review and adjustment,taking note that, pursuant to decision iv/6, the technical working group is instructed to keep the lists of wastes under review and to make recommendations to the conference of the parties for revisions or adjustments,further taking note that, pursuant to decision iv/6, the technical working group is instructed to review the procedure for reviewing or adjusting the lists of wastes, including the application form as set out in the note on consolidated lists of wastes and the applicable procedures for their review and adjustment and to submit a proposal for approval at the fifth meeting of the conference of the parties,decides to adopt the following amendment and adoption of annexes to this convention:1. add the following paragraphs at the end of annex i:(a) to facilitate the application of this convention, and subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), wastes listed in annex viii are characterized as hazardous pursuant to article 1, paragraph 1 (a), of this convention, and wastes listed in annex ix are not covered by article 1, paragraph 1(a), of this convention.(b) designation of a waste on annex viii does not preclude, in a particular case, the use of annex iii to demonstrate that a waste is not hazardous pursuant to article 1, paragraph 1(a), of this convention.(c) designation of a waste on annex ix does not preclude, in a particular case, characterization of such a waste as hazardous pursuant to article 1, paragraph 1(a), of this convention if it contains annex i material to an extent causing it to exhibit an annex iii characteristic.(d) annexes viii and ix do not affect the application of article 1, paragraph 1(a), of this
