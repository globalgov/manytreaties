conference of the parties therefore agreed to include all species of the family in appendix i.2 nb: originally proposed for inclusion with the name protobothrops mangshanensis. this name was amended to follow the standard nomenclature adopted by the conference of the parties in resolution conf. 12.11 (rev. cop15) and its successor.3 nb: originally proposed for inclusion with the name aspideretes leithii, but amended to follow the nomenclature adopted at cop16 in relation to other species of the genus nilssonia.
