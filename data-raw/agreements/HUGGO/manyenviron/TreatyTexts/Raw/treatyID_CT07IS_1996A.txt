substances or wastes), which is capable of chemical reaction, emitting gases such temperature and pressure and at such a speed, causing damage to the surroundings.2flammable liquids.the term "flammable" tantamount term. are flammable liquids, liquids or liquid mixtures containing solids in solution or suspension (for example : paints, lacquers, varnishes, etc., except for products or wastes classified differently, according to their hazard characteristics) which emit flammable vapours at or above 60.5 c in a closed vessel or more than 65.6 c in an open container. (since the results obtained in the open and closed vessels may not be exactly comparable and even individual results obtained by the same method, often very different from one another, the rules, which differ from the figures cited above are in the spirit of these definitions).3flammable solids.solids or solid waste, but are classified as explosives, which were found during transportation, can easily ignite or may cause or intensify fire through friction.4the substances or waste that can samovozgoratsya.the substances or waste, which can spontaneously heat to the surroundings or in contact with the heated air, and then can samovosplamenyatsya.the substances or waste, emit flammable gases in collaboration with water.the substances or waste that is in contact with water can be allocated samovozgorayuschimisya or flammable gases in dangerous quantities.6oxidizing substances.substances are not necessarily fuel, but usually through an oxygen may cause or contribute to the combustion of other materials.7organic peroxides.organic substances contain bivalentnuyu group o, which are thermally unstable and prone to substance self exothermic decomposition.8poisonous (acute).the substances or waste, which if swallowed by inhalation, digestion and through the skin, can cause death or to have a severe negative impact.9infectious.substances or wastes containing living microorganisms or their toxins which are known or suspected to cause disease in animals or humans.10corrosives.the substances or waste, which by chemical exposure may direct contact severely damage living tissue, or in the event of spillage or leakage could cause damage and even destroying other goods or vehicles; they can also cause other hazards.11of toxic gases in contact with air or water.the substances or waste that is in contact with air or water can release toxic gases in dangerous quantities.12toxic substances, delayed or chronic.the substances or waste, which if swallowed by inhalation, digestion and through the skin can cause serious, prolonged or chronic diseases, including cancer.13ecotoxic.the substances or waste, which, if release into the environment can represent either immediately or over time, threaten the environment as a result of bioavailability and / or toxic effects on biotic systems.14substances which may in any way after the removal of yielding another material,for example, leachate, which possesses some of the characteristics above.special opinionrepublic of armenia on the draft agreement on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous and other wastes ARTICLE 12 words : "temporarily applied from the date of signing and ..."g. bagratyanspecial opiniongeorgia to the draft agreement on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous and other wastes "we believe that the draft agreement be amended as follows : ARTICLE 2 : delete the words "... and the special goods and products for military use."
