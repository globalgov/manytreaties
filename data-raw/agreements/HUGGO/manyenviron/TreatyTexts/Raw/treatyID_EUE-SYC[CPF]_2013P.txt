1.   For a period of six years from the date of the start of the provisional application, the fishing opportunities granted under Article 5 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement shall be as follows:

(a)

40 tuna purse seine vessels, and

(b)

6 surface longliners.

2.   Paragraph 1 shall apply subject to Articles 5 and 6 of this Protocol.

3.   Under Article 6 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Union may engage in fishing activities in fishing areas within the Seychelles' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) only if they are in possession of a fishing authorisation or licence issued under this Protocol in accordance with the Annex hereto.

Article 2

Financial contribution - Methods of payment

1.   For the period referred to in Article 1, the total financial contribution referred to in Article 7 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement shall be EUR 30 700 000 for the whole duration of this Protocol.

2.   This total financial contribution shall comprise:

(a)

an annual amount for access to Seychelles' EEZ of EUR 2 750 000 for the first and second year of application of the Protocol and EUR 2 500 000 for the remaining years (three to six), equivalent to a reference tonnage of 50 000 tonnes per year, and

(b)

a specific amount of EUR 2 600 000 for the first and second year of application of the Protocol and EUR 2 500 000 for the remaining years (three to six) for the support and implementation of Seychelles' sectoral fisheries policy and maritime policy.

3.   Paragraph 1 shall apply subject to Articles 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this Protocol.

4.   The European Union shall pay the total amounts fixed in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article each year during the period of application of this Protocol. Payment shall be made no later than 90 days after the date of the start of the provisional application, and no later than the anniversary date of this Protocol for the following years.

5.

(a)

The Seychelles authorities shall monitor the development of the fisheries by EU vessels to ensure appropriate management of the reference tonnage of 50,000 tonnes per year. In the course of this monitoring, the Seychelles shall notify the EU as soon as the total catches of EU vessels reported in the Seychelles fishing area reaches 80 % of the reference tonnage. On receipt of this notification, the EU shall immediately notify the Member States of this notification.

(b)

Once the level of 80 % of the reference tonnage has been reached, the Seychelles shall monitor on a daily basis the level of catches from the EU fleet, and shall inform the EU immediately when the reference tonnage level is exceeded. The EU shall also immediately inform the Member States on receipt of the notification from the Seychelles.

(c)

From the date of notification, identified in point (b) above, by the Seychelles to the EU, to the end of the period of the annual fishing authorisations for the vessels, the Unit price paid for the additional catches shall be the total Unit rate for the year in question. Of this amount, the shipowners shall pay the amount equivalent to that foreseen under Section 2 of the Annex, relating to Fishing Authorisation conditions for the year concerned.

(d)

The EU shall pay the amount equivalent to the balance between the Unit price to be paid for that year, and the amount paid by the shipowners. However, the total annual amount paid by the European Union shall not be more than twice the amount indicated in Article 2(2)(a). Where the quantities caught by EU vessels exceed the quantities corresponding to twice the total amount of the annual payment from the EU, the amount due for the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid in the following year.

6.   Seychelles shall have full discretion regarding the use to which the financial contribution specified in Article 2 (2)(a) is put.

7.   The financial contribution shall be paid into a single Seychelles' Public Treasury account opened with the Central Bank of Seychelles. The account number shall be provided by the Seychelles authorities.

Article 3

Promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in Seychelles' waters

1.   No later than 90 days after the date of the start of the provisional application, the European Union and Seychelles shall agree, within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 9 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, on a multiannual sectoral programme and detailed implementing rules covering, in particular:

(a)

annual and multiannual programmes for using the specific amount of the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(2)(b);

(b)

the objectives, both annual and multiannual, to be achieved with a view to introducing, over time, responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries, taking account of the priorities expressed by Seychelles in its national fisheries and maritime policy, and other policies relating to, or having an impact on, the promotion of responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries, including marine protected areas;

(c)

criteria and procedures for evaluating the results obtained each year.

2.   Any proposed amendments to the multiannual sectoral programme shall be approved by both Parties within the Joint Committee.

3.   If either Party requests a special meeting of the Joint Committee, as provided by Article 9 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, a written request shall be sent by the Party requesting the special meeting of the Joint Committee at least 14 days before the date of the proposed meeting.

4.   Each year, Seychelles may allocate, if necessary, an additional amount to the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(2)(b) with a view to implementing the multiannual programme. This allocation shall be notified to the European Union.

Article 4

Scientific cooperation on responsible fishing

1.   The two Parties hereby undertake to promote responsible fishing in Seychelles' waters based on the principle of non-discrimination between the different fleets fishing in those waters.

2.   During the period covered by this Protocol, the European Union and Seychelles shall endeavour to monitor the state of fishery resources in the Seychelles' EEZ.

3.   The Parties shall also exchange relevant statistical, biological, conservation and environmental information as may be required for the purpose of managing and conserving the living resources.

4.   Both Parties shall endeavour to respect the resolutions and recommendations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) regarding conservation and responsible management of fisheries.

5.   Based on the recommendations and resolutions taken within the IOTC and the best available scientific advice and, where appropriate, the results of the joint scientific meeting provided for by Article 4 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, the two Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 9 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and, where necessary, agree on the measures to ensure sustainable management of Seychelles' fisheries resources.

Article 5

Adjustment of fishing opportunities and revision of technical provisions by mutual agreement through the Joint Committee

1.   As provided for in Article 9 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, the Joint Committee may reassess the fishing opportunities referred to in Article 1 and may adjust them by mutual agreement in the Joint Committee insofar as the recommendations and resolutions of IOTC support that such an adjustment will secure the sustainable management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean.

2.   In this case the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(2)(a) shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis. However, the total annual amount paid by the European Union shall not be more than twice the figure indicated in Article 2(2)(a).

3.   The Joint Committee may also, as necessary, revise by mutual agreement technical provisions of this Protocol and the Annex thereto.

Article 6

New fishing opportunities

1.   In the event that European Union fishing vessels become interested in engaging in fisheries not provided for in Article 1 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, the Parties shall consult each other before any possible authorisation is granted for any such activities and, where appropriate, agree on the conditions for such fishing including effecting corresponding amendments to this Protocol and the Annex thereto.

2.   The Parties should encourage experimental fishing, especially relating to under exploited deep water species, present in Seychelles' waters. To this end, and at the request of a Party, the Parties shall consult each other with a view to determining on a case-by-case basis, the species, conditions and other parameters that are relevant.

3.   The Parties shall carry out experimental fishing in accordance with parameters that will be agreed by both Parties in an administrative arrangement where appropriate. The authorisations for experimental fishing should be agreed for a maximum period of 6 months.

4.   In the event that the Parties consider that experimental campaigns have given positive results, the Government of Seychelles may allocate fishing possibilities of the new species to the European Union fleet until the expiration of this Protocol. The financial compensation mentioned in Article 2(2)(a) of this Protocol shall consequently be increased. Ship-owners' fees and conditions as provided for in the Annex shall be amended accordingly.

2.

'Fishing authorisation' means a valid entitlement or license to engage in fishing activities in accordance with the terms of the said fishing authorisation provided under the Protocol.

3.

For a European Union vessel to be eligible, neither the owner, the master nor the vessel itself must be prohibited from fishing in Seychelles. They must be in order with the laws of the Seychelles and they must have fulfilled all prior obligations arising from their fishing activities in Seychelles under fisheries agreements concluded with the European Union. Moreover, they shall comply with the Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 regarding fishing authorisations.

4.

All European Union vessels applying for a fishing authorisation shall be represented by an agent resident in Seychelles. The name and address of that agent shall be stated in the application.

5.

The relevant European Union authorities shall submit to the competent authority of Seychelles as defined in Article 2 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement a fishing authorisation application for each vessel wishing to fish under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement at least 20 days before the date of commencement of the period of validity.

6.

Where a fishing authorisation application has not been submitted prior to the period of validity under point 5, the vessel-owner may do so through the EU during the period of validity, no later than 20 days before the start of the fishing activities. In such cases, vessel owners shall pay the advance fees due for the full validity period of the fishing authorisation.

7.

Each application for a fishing authorisation shall be submitted to the competent authority of Seychelles on a form drawn up in accordance with the specimen in Appendix 1 and shall be accompanied by the following documents:

11.

A fishing authorisation shall be issued for a specific vessel and shall not be transferable except for force majeure, as outlined in point 12 below.

12.

Where force majeure is proven, at the request of the European Union, a vessel's fishing authorisation may be transferred, for the remaining period of its validity, to another eligible vessel with similar characteristics, with no further fee due. However, for longliners, if the gross registered tonnage (GRT) of the replacing vessel is higher, the difference in fee shall be paid pro rata temporis.

13.

The owner of the first vessel, or his agent, shall return the cancelled fishing authorisation to the competent authority of Seychelles via the Delegation of the European Union responsible for the Seychelles.

In the case where Seychelles seamen are embarked, employment contracts shall be drawn up between the shipowners' agent(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives in consultation with the competent authorities of Seychelles. These contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life insurance, sickness and accident insurance, the pension benefits, as well as the basic wage to be paid under the provisions of this Chapter. A copy of the contract shall be given to the signatories.

8.

In the case where Seychelles seamen are embarked, their wages shall be paid by the shipowners. The basic wage conditions, i.e. minimum wage before the addition of bonuses, granted to Seychelles seamen shall be set on either the basis of that provided by Seychelles legislation or the minimum standard set by the ILO. The basic minimum wage shall not be lower than that applied to Seychelles crews performing similar duties and shall under no circumstances be below ILO standards.

9.

For the purposes of the enforcement and application of the law of employment of Seychelles, the shipowner's agent shall be considered as the local representative of the shipowner. The contract concluded between the agent and the seamen shall include also the conditions for repatriation and the pension benefit applicable to them.

10.

All seamen employed aboard European Union vessels shall report to the master of the vessel designated on the day before their proposed embarkation date. Where a seaman fails to report on the date and time agreed for embarkation, shipowners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the seaman on board.

11.

Where the number of Seychelles qualified seamen or trainees on board of tuna seiners does not reach the minimum level as provided in point 1 for reasons other than that referred to in point 10, each shipowner shall be obliged to pay a flat-rate amount equivalent to a figure based on the number of days that his fleet operated in Seychelles' waters, taking the entry of the first vessel and exit of the last one as a reference, multiplied by the amount per day which is fixed at EUR 20. The flat rate amount shall be paid to the Seychelles authorities at the latest within 90 days from the end of the validity period of the fishing authorisation.

CHAPTER V

OBSERVERS

1.

Both Parties recognize the importance of respecting the obligations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) Resolution 11/04 with regards to the Scientific Observer Programme.

2.

For compliance purposes, provisions for observers are as follows, except in case of space limitations due to security requirements:

2.1

Vessels authorised to fish in Seychelles' waters under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement shall take on board observers appointed by the Seychelles authorities on the terms set out below.

2.1.1

European Union fishing vessels shall, at the request of the Seychelles authorities, take on board one observer if possible, in the context of a regional observation programme.

2.1.2

The Seychelles authorities shall draw up a list of vessels designated to take an observer on board and a list of appointed observers. These lists shall be kept up to date. They shall be forwarded to the European Commission as soon as they have been drawn up, and every three months thereafter where they have been updated.

2.1.3

The Seychelles authorities shall inform the shipowners concerned, or their agents, of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board their vessel no later than 15 days before the observer's planned embarkation date.

3.

The time spent on board by observers shall be fixed by the Seychelles authorities but, as a general rule, it should not exceed the time required to carry out their duties, unless the observer is appointed in the context of regional Observer Programmes where he/she may remain on board to undertake his/her duties in the context of the Programme. The Seychelles authorities shall inform the shipowners or their agents thereof when notifying them of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board the vessel concerned.

4.

The conditions under which observers are taken on board shall be agreed between shipowners or their agents and the Seychelles authorities after notification of the list of designated vessels.

5.

Within two weeks and giving ten days' notice, the shipowners concerned shall make known at which port of Seychelles and on what dates they intend to take observers on board.

6.

Where observers are taken on board in a foreign port, their travel costs shall be borne by the shipowner. Should a vessel with an observer (or two) from Seychelles on board leave Seychelles' waters, all measures must be taken to ensure the observer returns to Seychelles as soon as possible at the expense of the shipowner.

7.

If the observer is not present at the time and place agreed and during the twelve hours following the time agreed, shipowners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the observer on board.

8.

Observers shall be treated as officers. They shall carry out the following tasks:

8.1

observe the fishing activities of the vessels;

8.2

verify the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations;

8.3

note the fishing gear used;

8.4

verify the catch data for Seychelles' waters recorded in the logbook;

8.5

9.

Masters of vessels shall do everything reasonably practicable to ensure the physical safety and welfare of observers while on board.

10.

Similarly, as far as possible, they shall be offered every facility needed to carry out their duties. The master shall give them access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of their duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel's fishing activities, including in particular the logbook and the navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the performance of their tasks as observers.

11.

While on board, observers shall:

11.1

take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of their boarding and presence on the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations,

11.2

respect the material and equipment on board and the confidentiality of all documents belonging to the vessel.

2.

An EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS system, or if the ERS system installed on board is not functional, is not allowed to enter the waters of Seychelles to conduct fishing activities.

3.

The ERS data is transmitted in accordance with the present guidelines to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre (hereinafter referred to as 'FMC') of the flag State, which ensures the automatic provision to the Seychelles FMC.

4.

The flag State and Seychelles ensure that their FMC are equipped with the hardware and software required for the automatic transmission of ERS data in XML format available on [http://ec.europa.eu/cfp/control/codes/index_en.htm], and have backup procedures capable of recording and storing ERS data in a computer readable form for a period of at least 3 years.

5.

Any modification or update of the format referred to in point 3 shall be identified and dated, and shall be operational six months after its implementation.

6.

The ERS data transmission must use electronic means of communication managed by the European Commission on behalf of the EU, identified as DEH (Data Exchange Highway).

7.

The flag State and Seychelles shall both designate single points of contact for ERS:

(a)

The corresponding ERS single points of contact are appointed for a minimum period of six months;

(b)

The FMC of the flag State and Seychelles shall communicate to each other, before 1 April 2014, the contact details (name, address, telephone, telex, e-mail) of their corresponding ERS single point of contact;

(c)

Any changes to the contact details mentioned above must be communicated without delay.

Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)

General Principles

1.

With regard to the Vessel Monitoring System mentioned in the Chapter 3 Section 5 of the Annex to the Protocol, all fishing vessels fishing, or intending to fish, in the fishing waters of Seychelles, shall comply with all the following provisions.

2.

An EU vessel that is not equipped with a VMS Vessel Locator Device (VLD), or if the VLD installed on board is not functional, is not allowed to enter the waters of Seychelles to conduct fishing activities.

3.

Vessel positions and movements shall be monitored, inter alia, by a VMS, without discrimination, in accordance with the provisions set out below.

4.

For the purposes of VMS, the Seychelles authorities shall communicate to the Fisheries Monitoring Centres (FMCs) of the flag States the geographical coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) of the Seychelles' fishing waters.

5.

The Seychelles authorities will transmit this information in electronic format, expressed in degrees decimal in the WGS-84 datum to the European Union. The coordinates are those indicated in Appendix 2.1 to this Annex.

6.

The Seychelles authorities and the national FMCs will exchange information on their respective contact coordinates, namely electronic addresses in https format or where appropriate other secure communication protocol and the specifications to be used in their respective FMCs as well as any alternative means of communication to be used in case of failure. All this information will be included in the Appendix 7 point 2 to this Annex.

7.

All vessels holding a fishing authorisation must be equipped with a fully operationalVLD installed on board, to enable automatic and continuous communication of their geographical coordinates, to the FMC of their flag state. The frequency of transmission shall be on an hourly basis.

8.

It is agreed that, at the request of either Party, there will be an exchange of information on the VMS equipment used, in order to ensure that the said equipment is fully compatible with the requirements of the other Party for the purposes of these provisions.

9.

The Parties agree to review these provisions as and when appropriate, including the relevant analysis of cases of malfunctioning or anomalies related to individual vessels. All such cases will have to be notified by the Seychelles authorities to the EU flag Member States and to the European Commission at least 15 days before the review which shall occurs in the framework of the Joint Committee (JC).

10.

Any dispute concerning the interpretation or the application of these provisions shall be subject to consultation between the Parties within the framework of the Joint Committee provided for in Article 9 of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement.

Integrity of the VMS

1.

The vessel master is prohibited, or anyone authorised by him to switch off, obstruct its VLD, or interferes in any form with the data transmitted to the Flag State FMC, when operating in Seychelles' waters.

2.

The master shall be responsible for the accuracy of the VMS data recorded and transmitted.

3.

In particular, the master shall ensure that:

(a)

data are not altered in any way;

(b)

the antenna or the antennas connected to the satellite tracking devices are not obstructed in any way;

(c)

the power supply of the satellite tracking devices is not interrupted in any way;

(d)

the vessel locating device is not removed from the vessel or the place where it was first installed;

(e)

any replacement of a vessel tracking device is immediately notified to the Seychelles competent authority.

(f)

any breach of the above-mentioned obligations may render the master liable for sanctions as provided under the written laws of Seychelles.

4.

The VMS hardware and software components shall be, as far as possible, tamper proof i.e. shall not permit the input or output of false positions and must not be capable of being manually over-ridden.

5.

The system shall be fully automatic and operational at all times regardless of environmental conditions. It shall be prohibited to destroy, damage, render inoperative or otherwise interfere with the satellite tracking device.

6.

VMS data transmission

1.

When a vessel fishing under the EU/Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement enters into the Seychelles' fishing waters, subsequent position reports shall be automatically communicated by the FMC of the flag State to the FMC of Seychelles, in real time, on a frequency set on point 7 above.

2.

The VMS messages reported shall be identified by using the following 3 letter codes:

(a)

'ENT', first VMS data report transmitted by each vessel upon entering the Seychelles fishing waters;

(b)

'POS', every VMS data report transmitted by each vessel while within the Seychelles fishing waters;

(c)

'EXI', first VMS data report transmitted by each vessel after exiting the Seychelles fishing waters;

3.

The frequency of transmission can be changed up to a 30 minutes basis, when strong evidence is provided demonstrating that the vessel is perpetrating an infringement.

(a)

This evidence shall be submitted by the Seychelles' FMC to the FMC of the flag State and to the European Commission, along with the request to alter frequency. The FMC shall send the data to the FMC of Seychelles automatically and in real time, immediately after receiving the request.

(b)

The FMC of Seychelles shall notify immediately the FMC of the flag State and the European Commission of the end of the monitoring procedure.

(c)

The FMC of the flag State and the European Commission shall be informed of the follow up of any inspection procedure based on the special request under point 9 above.

The messages referred to in point 7 shall be transmitted electronically in https format, or other secure communication protocols, subject to prior agreement between the relevant FMCs.

Malfunction of the VMS equipment on board of the vessel

1.

In the event of a technical problem or malfunction of the satellite monitoring device installed on board the fishing vessel, the master of that vessel shall communicate the information specified in point 7 by any of the communications form agreed in the point 6 of the General Principles above, to the FMC of the flag State concerned, starting from the time the failure or malfunction was informed by the Seychelles competent authority.

2.

At least one global position report every four hours shall be transmitted while the vessel stays in Seychelles' waters. This global position report will include the hourly positions as registered by the master of that vessel during those four hours.

3.

The FMC of the flag State or the vessel itself shall forward these messages to the Seychelles' FMC without delay. In case of necessity or doubts, the Seychelles competent authority could ask from a given vessel a transmission of position report every hour.

4.

Defective equipment shall be repaired or replaced as soon as the vessel concludes its fishing trip. Any new fishing trip shall not begin until the equipment has been repaired or replaced and duly authorised by the Flag State, which will notify the Seychelles authorities of its decision.

FMC failure - Non-receipt of VMS data by the Seychelles FMC

1.

When one of the FMCs does not receive VMS data, this FMC shall promptly inform the other FMC contact of the other FMC and, if necessary, work together to solve the problem.

2.

The FMC of the flag State and the FMC of Seychelles will mutually agree before 18 January 2014 alternative electronic means of communication to be used for the transmission of VMS data in case of failure of FMC, and inform without delay of any changes to these means.

3.

Whenever the FMC of Seychelles reports that the VMS data have not been received, the FMC of the flag State shall identify the causes of the problem and take appropriate measures to ensure that the problem is solved. The FMC of the flag State shall notify the FMC of Seychelles of the results and measures taken within 24 hours from the acknowledgment of the failure.

4.

If the resolution of the problem requires more than 24 hours, the FMC of the flag State shall forward the missing VMS data to the FMC of Seychelles using the alternative means of communication referred to in point 6 of the General Principles above.

5.

Seychelles shall inform its competent Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) services so that EU vessels are not subject to any infringement procedure for non-receipt of VMS data by the Seychelles FMC due to the failure of the FMCs systems.

Maintenance of an FMC

1.

The scheduled maintenance of an FMC (maintenance programme) that is likely to affect the exchange of VMS data, must be notified to the other FMC at least 72 hours in advance, indicating if possible, the date and the duration of the maintenance. Unscheduled maintenance shall be communicated as soon as possible to the other FMC.

2.

During the maintenance, the provision of VMS data can be queued until the system is operational again. Relevant VMS data are then made available immediately after maintenance has been completed.

3.

If maintenance lasts more than 24 hours, the VMS data will be transmitted to the other FMC using the electronic alternative means referred to in point 6 of the General Principles above.

4.

Seychelles authorities shall inform its competent MCS services so that EU vessels are not subject to any infringement procedure for non-transmission of VMS data due to maintenance of the FMC.
