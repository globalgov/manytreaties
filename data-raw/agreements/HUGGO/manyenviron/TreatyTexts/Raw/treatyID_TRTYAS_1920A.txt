scale of not less than 1:1,000,000 on which the land claimed is clearly marked.(3) the notification must be accompanied by the deposit of a sum of one penny for each acre (40 ares) of land claimed, to defray the expenses of the examination of the claims.(4) the commissioner will be entitled to require from the claimants any further documents or information which he may consider necessary.(5) the commissioner will examine the claims so notified. for this purpose he will be entitled to avail himself of such expert assistance as he may consider necessary, and in case of need to cause investigations to be carried out on the spot.(6) the remuneration of the commissioner will be fixed by agreement between the danish government and the other governments concerned. the commissioner will fix the remuneration of such assistants as he considers it necessary to employ.(7) the commissioner, after examining the claims, will prepare a report showing precisely the claims which he is of opinion should be recognised at once and those which, either because they are disputed or for any other reason, he is of opinion should be submitted to arbitration as hereinafter provided. copies of this report will be forwarded by the commissioner to the governments concerned.(8) if the amount of the sums deposited in accordance with clause (3) is insufficient to cover the expenses of the examination of the claims, the commissioner will, in every case where he is of opinion that a claim should be recognised, at once state what further sum the claimant should be required to pay. this sum will be based on the amount of the land to which the claimant's title is recognised. if the sums deposited in accordance with clause (3) exceed the expenses of the examination the balance will be devoted to the cost of arbitration hereinafter provided for.(9) within three months from the date of the report referred to in clause (7) of this paragraph, the norwegian government shall take the necessary steps to confer upon claimants whose claims have been recognised by the commissioner a valid title securing to them the exclusive property in the land in question, in accordance with the

the intermediary of their respective governments statements indicating precisely their claims and accompanied by such documents and arguments as they may wish to submit in support thereof.(3) within two months from the appointment of the secretary referred to in clause (1) the tribunal shall meet at copenhagen for the purpose of dealing with the claims which have been submitted to it.(4) the language of the tribunal shall be english. documents or arguments may be submitted to it by the interested parties in their own language, but in that case must be accompanied by an english translation.(5) the claimants shall be entitled, if they so desire, to be heard by the tribunal either in person or by counsel, and the tribunal shall be entitled to call upon the claimants to present such additional explanations, documents or arguments as it may think necessary.(6) before the hearing of any case the tribunal shall require from the parties a deposit or security for such sum as it may think necessary to cover the share of each party in the expenses of the tribunal. in fixing the amount of such sum the tribunal shall base itself principally on the extent of the land claimed. the tribunal shall also have power to demand a further deposit from the parties in cases where special expense is involved.(7) the honorarium of the arbitrators shall be calculated per month, and fixed by the governments concerned. the salary of the secretary and any other persons employed by the tribunal shall be fixed by the president.(8) subject to the provisions of this annex the tribunal shall have full power to regulate its own procedure.(9) in dealing with the claims the tribunal shall take into consideration:(a) any applicable rules of international law;(b) the general principles of justice and equity;(c) the following circumstances:(i) the date on which the land claimed was first occupied by the claimant or his predecessors in title;(ii) the date on which the claim was notified to the government of the claimant;(iii) the extent to which the claimant or his predecessors in title have developed and exploited the land claimed. in this connection the tribunal shall take into account the extent to which the claimants may have been prevented from developing their undertakings by conditions or restrictions resulting from the war of 1914-1919.(10) all the expenses of the tribunal shall be divided among the claimants in such proportion as the tribunal shall decide. if the amount of the sums paid in accordance with clause (6) is larger than the expenses of the tribunal, the balance shall be returned to the parties whose claims have been recognised in such proportion as the tribunal shall think fit.(11) the decisions of the tribunal shall be communicated by it to the governments concerned, including in every case the norwegian government. the norwegian government shall within three months from the receipt of each decision take the necessary steps to confer upon the claimants whose claims have been recognised by the tribunal a valid title to the land in question, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force or to be enforced in the territories specified in article 1, and subject to the mining regulations referred to in article 8 of the present treaty. nevertheless, the titles so conferred will only become definitive on the payment by the claimant concerned, within such reasonable period as the norwegian government may fix, of his share of the expenses of the tribunal.3.any claims which are not notified to the commissioner in accordance with clause (1) of paragraph 1, or which not having been recognised by him are not submitted to the tribunal in accordance with paragraph 2, will be finally extinguished.map of
