imports or exports have in fact taken place.4. any member which has reason to believe that another member has not adequately met its notification obligation may raise the matter with the member concerned. if the matter is not satisfactorily resolved it may make a counter-notification to the council for trade in goods, for consideration by the working party set up under paragraph 5, simultaneously informing the member concerned.5. a working party shall be set up, on behalf of the council for trade in goods, to review notifications and counter-notifications. in the light of this review and without prejudice to paragraph 4(c) of article xvii, the council for trade in goods may make recommendations with regard to the adequacy of notifications and the need for further information. the working party shall also review, in the light of the notifications received, the adequacy of the above-mentioned questionnaire on state trading and the coverage of state trading enterprises notified under paragraph 1. it shall also develop an illustrative list showing the kinds of relationships between governments and enterprises, and the kinds of activities, engaged in by these enterprises, which may be relevant for the purposes of article xvii. it is understood that the secretariat will provide a general background paper for the working party on the operations of state trading enterprises as they relate to international trade. membership of the working party shall be open to all members indicating their wish to serve on it. it shall meet within a year of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement and thereafter at least once a year. it shall report annually to the council for trade in goods.[6]understanding on the balance-of-payments provisions of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994members,recognizing the provisions of articles xii and xviii:b of gatt 1994 and of the declaration on trade measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes adopted on 28 november 1979 (bisd 26s/205-209, referred to in this understanding as the "1979 declaration") and in order to clarify such provisions[7];hereby agree as follows:application of measures1. members confirm their commitment to announce publicly, as soon as possible, time-schedules for the removal of restrictive import measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes. it is understood that such time-schedules may be modified as appropriate to take into account changes in the balance-of-payments situation. whenever a time-schedule is not publicly announced by a member, that member shall provide justification as to the reasons therefor.2. members confirm their commitment to give preference to those measures which have the least disruptive effect on trade. such measures (referred to in this understanding as "price-based measures") shall be understood to include import surcharges, import deposit requirements or other equivalent trade measures with an impact on the price of imported goods. it is understood that, notwithstanding the provisions of article ii, price-based measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes may be applied by a member in excess of the duties inscribed in the schedule of that member. furthermore, that member shall indicate the amount by which the price-based measure exceeds the bound duty clearly and separately under the notification procedures of this understanding.3. members shall seek to avoid the imposition of new quantitative restrictions for balance-of-payments purposes unless, because of a critical balance-of-payments situation, price-based measures cannot arrest a sharp deterioration in the external payments position. in those cases in which a member applies quantitative restrictions, it shall provide justification as to the reasons why price-based measures are not an adequate instrument to deal with the balance-of-payments situation. a member maintaining quantitative restrictions shall indicate in successive consultations the progress made in significantly reducing the incidence and restrictive effect of such measures. it is understood that not more than one type of restrictive import measure taken for balance-of-payments purposes may be applied on the same product.4. members confirm that restrictive import measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes may only be applied to control the general level of imports and may not exceed what is necessary to address the balance-of-payments situation. in order to minimize any incidental protective effects, a member shall administer restrictions in a transparent manner. the authorities of the importing member shall provide adequate justification as to the criteria used to determine which products are subject to restriction. as provided in paragraph 3 of article xii and paragraph 10 of article xviii, members may, in the case of certain essential products, exclude or limit the application of surcharges applied across the board or other measures applied for balance-of-payments purposes. the term "essential products" shall be understood to mean products which meet basic consumption needs or which contribute to the member's effort to improve its balance-of-payments situation, such as capital goods or inputs needed for production. in the administration of quantitative restrictions, a member shall use discretionary licensing only when unavoidable and shall phase it out progressively. appropriate justification shall be provided as to the criteria used to determine allowable import quantities or values.procedures for balance-of-payments consultations5. the committee on balance-of-payments restrictions (referred to in this understanding as the "committee") shall carry out consultations in order to review all restrictive import measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes. the membership of the committee is open to all members indicating their wish to serve on it. the committee shall follow the procedures for consultations on balance-of-payments restrictions approved on 28 april 1970 (bisd 18s/48-53, referred to in this understanding as "full consultation procedures"), subject to the provisions set out below.6. a member applying new restrictions or raising the general level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification of the measures shall enter into consultations with the committee within four months of the adoption of such measures. the member adopting such measures may request that a consultation be held under paragraph 4(a) of article xii or paragraph 12(a) of article xviii as appropriate. if no such request has been made, the chairman of the committee shall invite the member to hold such a consultation. factors that may be examined in the consultation would include, inter alia, the introduction of new types of restrictive measures for balance-of-payments purposes, or an increase in the level or product coverage of restrictions.7. all restrictions applied for balance-of-payments purposes shall be subject to periodic review in the committee under paragraph 4(b) of article xii or under paragraph 12(b) of article xviii, subject to the possibility of altering the periodicity of consultations in agreement with the consulting member or pursuant to any specific review procedure that may be recommended by the general council.8. consultations may be held under the simplified procedures approved on 19 december 1972 (bisd 20s/47-49, referred to in this understanding as "simplified consultation procedures") in the case of least-developed country members or in the case of developing country members which are pursuing liberalization efforts in conformity with the schedule presented to the committee in previous consultations. simplified consultation procedures may also be used when the trade policy review of a developing country member is scheduled for the same calendar year as the date fixed for the consultations. in such cases the decision as to whether full consultation procedures should be used will be made on the basis of the factors enumerated in paragraph 8 of the 1979 declaration. except in the case of least-developed country members, no more than two successive consultations may be held under simplified consultation procedures.notification and documentation9. a member shall notify to the general council the introduction of or any changes in the application of restrictive import measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes, as well as any modifications in time-schedules for the removal of such measures as announced under paragraph 1. significant changes shall be notified to the general council prior to or not later than 30 days after their announcement. on a yearly basis, each member shall make available to the secretariat a consolidated notification, including all changes in laws, regulations, policy statements or public notices, for examination by members. notifications shall include full information, as far as possible, at the tariff-line level, on the type of measures applied, the criteria used for their administration, product coverage and trade flows affected.10. at the request of any member, notifications may be reviewed by the committee. such reviews would be limited to the clarification of specific issues raised by a notification or examination of whether a consultation under paragraph 4(a) of article xii or paragraph 12(a) of article xviii is required. members which have reasons to believe that a restrictive import measure applied by another member was taken for balance-of-payments purposes may bring the matter to the attention of the committee. the chairman of the committee shall request information on the measure and make it available to all members. without prejudice to the right of any member of the committee to seek appropriate clarifications in the course of consultations, questions may be submitted in advance for consideration by the consulting member.11. the consulting member shall prepare a basic document for the consultations which, in addition to any other information considered to be relevant, should include: (a) an overview of the balance-of-payments situation and prospects, including a consideration of the internal and external factors having a bearing on the balance-of-payments situation and the domestic policy measures taken in order to restore equilibrium on a sound and lasting basis; (b) a full description of the restrictions applied for balance-of-payments purposes, their legal basis and steps taken to reduce incidental protective effects; (c) measures taken since the last consultation to liberalize import restrictions, in the light of the conclusions of the committee; (d) a plan for the elimination and progressive relaxation of remaining restrictions. references may be made, when relevant, to the information provided in other notifications or reports made to the wto. under simplified consultation procedures, the consulting member shall submit a written statement containing essential information on the elements covered by the basic document.12. the secretariat shall, with a view to facilitating the consultations in the committee, prepare a factual background paper dealing with the different aspects of the plan for consultations. in the case of developing country members, the secretariat document shall include relevant background and analytical material on the incidence of the external trading environment on the balance-of-payments situation and prospects of the consulting member. the technical assistance services of the secretariat shall, at the request of a developing country member, assist in preparing the documentation for the consultations.conclusions of balance-of-payments consultations13. the committee shall report on its consultations to the general council. when full consultation procedures have been used, the report should indicate the committee's conclusions on the different elements of the plan for consultations, as well as the facts and reasons on which they are based. the committee shall endeavour to include in its conclusions proposals for recommendations aimed at promoting the implementation of articles xii and xviii:b, the 1979 declaration and this understanding. in those cases in which a time-schedule has been presented for the removal of restrictive measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes, the general council may recommend that, in adhering to such a time-schedule, a member shall be deemed to be in compliance with its gatt 1994 obligations. whenever the general council has made specific recommendations, the rights and obligations of members shall be assessed in the light of such recommendations. in the absence of specific proposals for recommendations by the general council, the committee's conclusions should record the different views expressed in the committee. when simplified consultation procedures have been used, the report shall include a summary of the main elements discussed in the committee and a decision on whether full consultation procedures are required.understanding on the interpretation of article xxiv of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994members,having regard to the provisions of article xxiv of gatt 1994;recognizing that customs unions and free trade areas have greatly increased in number and importance since the establishment of gatt 1947 and today cover a significant proportion of world trade;recognizing the contribution to the expansion of world trade that may be made by closer integration between the economies of the parties to such agreements;recognizing also that such contribution is increased if the elimination between the constituent territories of duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce extends to all trade, and diminished if any major sector of trade is excluded;reaffirming that the purpose of such agreements should be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other members with such territories; and that in their formation or enlargement the parties to them should to the greatest possible extent avoid creating adverse effects on the trade of other members;convinced also of the need to reinforce the effectiveness of the role of the council for trade in goods in reviewing agreements notified under article xxiv, by clarifying the criteria and procedures for the assessment of new or enlarged agreements, and improving the transparency of all article xxiv agreements;recognizing the need for a common understanding of the obligations of members under paragraph 12 of article xxiv;hereby agree as follows:1. customs unions, free-trade areas, and interim agreements leading to the formation of a customs union or free-trade area, to be consistent with article xxiv, must satisfy, inter alia, the provisions of paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of that article ARTICLE xxiv:52. the evaluation under paragraph 5(a) of article xxiv of the general incidence of the duties and other regulations of commerce applicable before and after the formation of a customs union shall in respect of duties and charges be based upon an overall assessment of weighted average tariff rates and of customs duties collected. this assessment shall be based on import statistics for a previous representative period to be supplied by the customs union, on a tariff-line basis and in values and quantities, broken down by wto country of origin. the secretariat shall compute the weighted average tariff rates and customs duties collected in accordance with the methodology used in the assessment of tariff offers in the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. for this purpose, the duties and charges to be taken into consideration shall be the applied rates of duty. it is recognized that for the purpose of the overall assessment of the incidence of other regulations of commerce for which quantification and aggregation are difficult, the examination of individual measures, regulations, products covered and trade flows affected may be required.3. the "reasonable length of time" referred to in paragraph 5(c) of article xxiv should exceed 10 years only in exceptional cases. in cases where members parties to an interim agreement believe that 10 years would be insufficient they shall provide a full explanation to the council for trade in goods of the need for a longer period ARTICLE xxiv:64. paragraph 6 of article xxiv establishes the procedure to be followed when a member forming a customs union proposes to increase a bound rate of duty. in this regard members reaffirm that the procedure set forth in article xxviii, as elaborated in the guidelines adopted on 10 november 1980 (bisd 27s/26-28) and in the understanding on the interpretation of article xxviii of gatt 1994, must be commenced before tariff concessions are modified or withdrawn upon the formation of a customs union or an interim agreement leading to the formation of a customs union.5. these negotiations will be entered into in good faith with a view to achieving mutually satisfactory compensatory adjustment. in such negotiations, as required by paragraph 6 of article xxiv, due account shall be taken of reductions of duties on the same tariff line made by other constituents of the customs union upon its formation. should such reductions not be sufficient to provide the necessary compensatory adjustment, the customs union would offer compensation, which may take the form of reductions of duties on other tariff lines. such an offer shall be taken into consideration by the members having negotiating rights in the binding being modified or withdrawn. should the compensatory adjustment remain unacceptable, negotiations should be continued. where, despite such efforts, agreement in negotiations on compensatory adjustment under article xxviii as elaborated by the understanding on the interpretation of article xxviii of gatt 1994 cannot be reached within a reasonable period from the initiation of negotiations, the customs union shall, nevertheless, be free to modify or withdraw the concessions; affected members shall then be free to withdraw substantially equivalent concessions in accordance with article xxviii.6. gatt 1994 imposes no obligation on members benefiting from a reduction of duties consequent upon the formation of a customs union, or an interim agreement leading to the formation of a customs union, to provide compensatory adjustment to its constituents.review of customs unions and free-trade areas7. all notifications made under paragraph 7(a) of article xxiv shall be examined by a working party in the light of the relevant provisions of gatt 1994 and of paragraph 1 of this understanding. the working party shall submit a report to the council for trade in goods on its findings in this regard. the council for trade in goods may make such recommendations to members as it deems appropriate.8. in regard to interim agreements, the working party may in its report make appropriate recommendations on the proposed time-frame and on measures required to complete the formation of the customs union or free-trade area. it may if necessary provide for further review of the agreement.9. members parties to an interim agreement shall notify substantial changes in the plan and schedule included in that agreement to the council for trade in goods and, if so requested, the council shall examine the changes.10. should an interim agreement notified under paragraph 7(a) of article xxiv not include a plan and schedule, contrary to paragraph 5(c) of article xxiv, the working party shall in its report recommend such a plan and schedule. the parties shall not maintain or put into force, as the case may be, such agreement if they are not prepared to modify it in accordance with these recommendations. provision shall be made for subsequent review of the implementation of the recommendations.11. customs unions and constituents of free-trade areas shall report periodically to the council for trade in goods, as envisaged by the contracting parties to gatt 1947 in their instruction to the gatt 1947 council concerning reports on regional agreements (bisd 18s/38), on the operation of the relevant agreement. any significant changes and/or developments in the agreements should be reported as they occur.dispute settlement12. the provisions of articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1994 as elaborated and applied by the dispute settlement understanding may be invoked with respect to any matters arising from the application of those provisions of article xxiv relating to customs unions, free-trade areas or interim agreements leading to the formation of a customs union or free-trade area ARTICLE xxiv:1213. each member is fully responsible under gatt 1994 for the observance of all provisions of gatt 1994, and shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure such observance by regional and local governments and authorities within its territory.14. the provisions of articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1994 as elaborated and applied by the dispute settlement understanding may be invoked in respect of measures affecting its observance taken by regional or local governments or authorities within the territory of a member. when the dispute settlement body has ruled that a provision of gatt 1994 has not been observed, the responsible member shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure its observance. the provisions relating to compensation and suspension of concessions or other obligations apply in cases where it has not been possible to secure such observance.15. each member undertakes to accord sympathetic consideration to and afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding any representations made by another member concerning measures affecting the operation of gatt 1994 taken within the territory of the former.understanding in respect of waivers of obligations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994members hereby agree as follows:1. a request for a waiver or for an extension of an existing waiver shall describe the measures which the member proposes to take, the specific policy objectives which the member seeks to pursue and the reasons which prevent the member from achieving its policy objectives by measures consistent with its obligations under gatt 1994.2. any waiver in effect on the date of entry into force of the wto agreement shall terminate, unless extended in accordance with the procedures above and those of article ix of the wto agreement, on the date of its expiry or two years from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, whichever is earlier.3. any member considering that a benefit accruing to it under gatt 1994 is being nullified or impaired as a result of:(a) the failure of the member to whom a waiver was granted to observe the terms or conditions of the waiver, or(b) the application of a measure consistent with the terms and conditions of the waivermay invoke the provisions of article xxiii of gatt 1994 as elaborated and applied by the dispute settlement understanding.understanding on the interpretation of article xxviii of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994members hereby agree as follows:1. for the purposes of modification or withdrawal of a concession, the member which has the highest ratio of exports affected by the concession (i.e. exports of the product to the market of the member modifying or withdrawing the concession) to its total exports shall be deemed to have a principal supplying interest if it does not already have an initial negotiating right or a principal supplying interest as provided for in paragraph 1 of article xxviii. it is however agreed that this paragraph will be reviewed by the council for trade in goods five years from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement with a view to deciding whether this criterion has worked satisfactorily in securing a redistribution of negotiating rights in favour of small and medium-sized exporting members. if this is not the case, consideration will be given to possible improvements, including, in the light of the availability of adequate data, the adoption of a criterion based on the ratio of exports affected by the concession to exports to all markets of the product in question.2. where a member considers that it has a principal supplying interest in terms of paragraph 1, it should communicate its claim in writing, with supporting evidence, to the member proposing to modify or withdraw a concession, and at the same time inform the secretariat. paragraph 4 of the "procedures for negotiations under article xxviii" adopted on 10 november 1980 (bisd 27s/26-28) shall apply in these cases.3. in the determination of which members have a principal supplying interest (whether as provided for in paragraph 1 above or in paragraph 1 of article xxviii) or substantial interest, only trade in the affected product which has taken place on an mfn basis shall be taken into consideration. however, trade in the affected product which has taken place under non-contractual preferences shall also be taken into account if the trade in question has ceased to benefit from such preferential treatment, thus becoming mfn trade, at the time of the negotiation for the modification or withdrawal of the concession, or will do so by the conclusion of that negotiation.4. when a tariff concession is modified or withdrawn on a new product (i.e. a product for which three years' trade statistics are not available) the member possessing initial negotiating rights on the tariff line where the product is or was formerly classified shall be deemed to have an initial negotiating right in the concession in question. the determination of principal supplying and substantial interests and the calculation of compensation shall take into account, inter alia, production capacity and investment in the affected product in the exporting member and estimates of export growth, as well as forecasts of demand for the product in the importing member. for the purposes of this paragraph, "new product" is understood to include a tariff item created by means of a breakout from an existing tariff line.5. where a member considers that it has a principal supplying or a substantial interest in terms of paragraph 4, it should communicate its claim in writing, with supporting evidence, to the member proposing to modify or withdraw a concession, and at the same time inform the secretariat. paragraph 4 of the above-mentioned "procedures for negotiations under article xxviii" shall apply in these cases.6. when an unlimited tariff concession is replaced by a tariff rate quota, the amount of compensation provided should exceed the amount of the trade actually affected by the modification of the concession. the basis for the calculation of compensation should be the amount by which future trade prospects exceed the level of the quota. it is understood that the calculation of future trade prospects should be based on the greater of:(a) the average annual trade in the most recent representative three-year period, increased by the average annual growth rate of imports in that same period, or by 10 per cent, whichever is the greater; or(b) trade in the most recent year increased by 10 per cent.in no case shall a member's liability for compensation exceed that which would be entailed by complete withdrawal of the concession.7. any member having a principal supplying interest, whether as provided for in paragraph 1 above or in paragraph 1 of article xxviii, in a concession which is modified or withdrawn shall be accorded an initial negotiating right in the compensatory concessions, unless another form of compensation is agreed by the members concerned.marrakesh protocol to the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994members,having carried out negotiations within the framework of gatt 1947, pursuant to the ministerial declaration on the uruguay round,hereby agree as follows:1. the schedule annexed to this protocol relating to a member shall become a schedule to gatt 1994 relating to that member on the day on which the wto agreement enters into force for that member. any schedule submitted in accordance with the ministerial decision on measures in favour of least-developed countries shall be deemed to be annexed to this protocol.[*]2. the tariff reductions agreed upon by each member shall be implemented in five equal rate reductions, except as may be otherwise specified in a member's schedule. the first such reduction shall be made effective on the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, each successive reduction shall be made effective on 1 january of each of the following years, and the final rate shall become effective no later than the date four years after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, except as may be otherwise specified in that member's schedule. unless otherwise specified in its schedule, a member that accepts the wto agreement after its entry into force shall, on the date that agreement enters into force for it, make effective all rate reductions that have already taken place together with the reductions which it would under the preceding sentence have been obligated to make effective on 1 january of the year following, and shall make effective all remaining rate reductions on the schedule specified in the previous sentence. the reduced rate should in each stage be rounded off to the first decimal. for agricultural products, as defined in article 2 of the agreement on agriculture, the staging of reductions shall be implemented as specified in the relevant parts of the schedules.3. the implementation of the concessions and commitments contained in the schedules annexed to this protocol shall, upon request, be subject to multilateral examination by the members. this would be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of members under agreements in annex 1a of the wto agreement.4. after the schedule annexed to this protocol relating to a member has become a schedule to gatt 1994 pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1, such member shall be free at any time to withhold or to withdraw in whole or in part the concession in such schedule with respect to any product for which the principal supplier is any other uruguay round participant the schedule of which has not yet become a schedule to gatt 1994. such action can, however, only be taken after written notice of any such withholding or withdrawal of a concession has been given to the council for trade in goods and after consultations have been held, upon request, with any member, the relevant schedule relating to which has become a schedule to gatt 1994 and which has a substantial interest in the product involved. any concessions so withheld or withdrawn shall be applied on and after the day on which the schedule of the member which has the principal supplying interest becomes a schedule to gatt 1994.5. (a) without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 4 of the agreement on agriculture, for the purpose of the reference in paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of article ii of gatt 1994 to the date of that agreement, the applicable date in respect of each product which is the subject of a concession provided for in a schedule of concessions annexed to this protocol shall be the date of this protocol.(b) for the purpose of the reference in paragraph 6(a) of article ii of gatt 1994 to the date of that agreement, the applicable date in respect of a schedule of concessions annexed to this protocol shall be the date of this protocol.6. in cases of modification or withdrawal of concessions relating to non-tariff measures as contained in part iii of the schedules, the provisions of article xxviii of gatt 1994 and the "procedures for negotiations under article xxviii" adopted on 10 november 1980 (bisd 27s/26-28) shall apply. this would be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of members under gatt 1994.7. in each case in which a schedule annexed to this protocol results for any product in treatment less favourable than was provided for such product in the schedules of gatt 1947 prior to the entry into force of the wto agreement, the member to whom the schedule relates shall be deemed to have taken appropriate action as would have been otherwise necessary under the relevant provisions of article xxviii of gatt 1947 or 1994. the provisions of this paragraph shall apply only to egypt, peru, south africa and uruguay.8. the schedules annexed hereto are authentic in the english, french or spanish language as specified in each schedule.9. the date of this protocol is 15 april 1994.agreement on agriculturemembers,having decided to establish a basis for initiating a process of reform of trade in agriculture in line with the objectives of the negotiations as set out in the punta del este declaration;recalling that their long-term objective as agreed at the mid-term review of the uruguay round "is to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system and that a reform process should be initiated through the negotiation of commitments on support and protection and through the establishment of strengthened and more operationally effective gatt rules and disciplines";recalling further that "the above-mentioned long-term objective is to provide for substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection sustained over an agreed period of time, resulting in correcting and preventing restrictions and

fullest liberalization of trade in tropical agricultural products as agreed at the mid-term review, and for products of particular importance to the diversification of production from the growing of illicit narcotic crops;noting that commitments under the reform programme should be made in an equitable way among all members, having regard to non-trade concerns, including food security and the need to protect the environment; having regard to the agreement that special and differential treatment for developing countries is an integral element of the negotiations, and taking into account the

as otherwise provided for in article 5 and annex 5 ARTICLE 5special safeguard provisions1. notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1(b) of article ii of gatt 1994, any member may take recourse to the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 below in connection with the importation of an agricultural product, in respect of which measures referred to in paragraph 2 of article 4 of this agreement have been converted into an ordinary customs duty and which is designated in its schedule with the symbol "ssg" as being the subject of a concession in respect of which the provisions of this article may be invoked, if:(a) the volume of imports of that product entering the customs territory of the member granting the concession during any year exceeds a trigger level which relates to the existing market access opportunity as set out in paragraph 4; or, but not concurrently:(b) the price at which imports of that product may enter the customs territory of the member granting the concession, as determined on the basis of the c.i.f. import price of the shipment concerned expressed in terms of its domestic currency, falls below a trigger price equal to the average 1986 to 1988 reference price[9] for the product concerned.2. imports under current and minimum access commitments established as part of a concession referred to in paragraph 1 above shall be counted for the purpose of determining the volume of imports required for invoking the provisions of subparagraph 1(a) and paragraph 4, but imports under such commitments shall not be affected by any additional duty imposed under either subparagraph 1(a) and paragraph 4 or subparagraph 1(b) and paragraph 5 below.3. any supplies of the product in question which were en route on the basis of a contract settled before the additional duty is imposed under subparagraph 1(a) and paragraph 4 shall be exempted from any such additional duty, provided that they may be counted in the volume of imports of the product in question during the following year for the purposes of triggering the provisions of subparagraph 1(a) in that year.4. any additional duty imposed under subparagraph 1(a) shall only be maintained until the end of the year in which it has been imposed, and may only be levied at a level which shall not exceed one third of the level of the ordinary customs duty in effect in the year in which the action is taken. the trigger level shall be set according to the following schedule based on market access opportunities defined as imports as a percentage of the corresponding domestic consumption[10] during the three preceding years for which data are available:(a) where such market access opportunities for a product are less than or equal to 10 per cent, the base trigger level shall equal 125 per cent;(b) where such market access opportunities for a product are greater than 10 per cent but less than or equal to 30 per cent, the base trigger level shall equal 110 per cent;(c) where such market access opportunities for a product are greater than 30 per cent, the base trigger level shall equal 105 per cent.in all cases the additional duty may be imposed in any year where the absolute volume of imports of the product concerned entering the customs territory of the member granting the concession exceeds the sum of (x) the base trigger level set out above multiplied by the average quantity of imports during the three preceding years for which data are available and (y) the absolute volume change in domestic consumption of the product concerned in the most recent year for which data are available compared to the preceding year, provided that the trigger level shall not be less than 105 per cent of the average quantity of imports in (x) above.5. the additional duty imposed under subparagraph 1(b) shall be set according to the following schedule:(a) if the difference between the c.i.f. import price of the shipment expressed in terms of the domestic currency (hereinafter referred to as the "import price") and the trigger price as defined under that subparagraph is less than or equal to 10 per cent of the trigger price, no additional duty shall be imposed;(b) if the difference between the import price and the trigger price (hereinafter referred to as the "difference") is greater than 10 per cent but less than or equal to 40 per cent of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 30 per cent of the amount by which the difference exceeds 10 per cent;(c) if the difference is greater than 40 per cent but less than or equal to 60 per cent of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 50 per cent of the amount by which the difference exceeds 40 per cent, plus the additional duty allowed under (b);(d) if the difference is greater than 60 per cent but less than or equal to 75 per cent, the additional duty shall equal 70 per cent of the amount by which the difference exceeds 60 per cent of the trigger price, plus the additional duties allowed under (b) and (c);(e) if the difference is greater than 75 per cent of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 90 per cent of the amount by which the difference exceeds 75 per cent, plus the additional duties allowed under (b), (c) and (d).6. for perishable and seasonal products, the conditions set out above shall be applied in such a manner as to take account of the specific characteristics of such products. in particular, shorter time periods under subparagraph 1(a) and paragraph 4 may be used in reference to the corresponding periods in the base period and different reference prices for different periods may be used under subparagraph 1(b).7. the operation of the special safeguard shall be carried out in a transparent manner. any member taking action under subparagraph 1(a) above shall give notice in writing, including relevant data, to the committee on agriculture as far in advance as may be practicable and in any event within 10 days of the implementation of such action. in cases where changes in consumption volumes must be allocated to individual tariff lines subject to action under paragraph 4, relevant data shall include the information and methods used to allocate these changes. a member taking action under paragraph 4 shall afford any interested members the opportunity to consult with it in respect of the conditions of application of such action. any member taking action under subparagraph 1(b) above shall give notice in writing, including relevant data, to the committee on agriculture within 10 days of the implementation of the first such action or, for perishable and seasonal products, the first action in any period. members undertake, as far as practicable, not to take recourse to the provisions of subparagraph 1(b) where the volume of imports of the products concerned are declining. in either case a member taking such action shall afford any interested members the opportunity to consult with it in respect of the conditions of application of such action.8. where measures are taken in conformity with paragraphs 1 through 7 above, members undertake not to have recourse, in respect of such measures, to the provisions of paragraphs 1(a) and 3 of article xix of gatt 1994 or paragraph 2 of article 8 of the agreement on safeguards.9. the provisions of this article shall remain in force for

with the mid-term review agreement that government measures of assistance, whether direct or indirect, to encourage agricultural and rural development are an integral part of the development programmes of developing countries, investment subsidies which are generally available to agriculture in developing country members and agricultural input subsidies generally available to low-income or resource-poor producers in developing country members shall be exempt from domestic support reduction commitments that would otherwise be applicable to such measures, as shall domestic support to

(a) direct payments under production-limiting programmes shall not be subject to the commitment to reduce domestic support if:(i) such payments are based on fixed area and yields; or(ii) such payments are made on 85 per cent or less of the base level of production; or(iii) livestock payments are made on a fixed number of head.(b) the exemption from the reduction commitment for direct payments meeting the above criteria shall be reflected by the exclusion of the value of those direct payments in a member's calculation of its current total ams ARTICLE 7general disciplines on domestic support1. each member shall ensure that any domestic support measures in favour of agricultural producers which are not subject to reduction commitments because they qualify under the criteria set out in annex 2 to this agreement are maintained in conformity therewith.2. (a) any domestic support measure in favour of agricultural producers, including any modification to such measure, and any measure that is subsequently introduced that cannot be shown to satisfy the criteria in annex 2 to this agreement or to be exempt from reduction by reason of any other provision of this agreement shall be included in the member's calculation of its current total ams.(b) where no total ams commitment exists in part iv of a member's schedule, the member shall not provide support to agricultural producers in excess of the relevant de minimis level set out in paragraph 4 of article 6.part v ARTICLE 8export competition commitmentseach member undertakes not to provide export subsidies otherwise than in conformity with this agreement and with the commitments as specified in that member's schedule ARTICLE 9export subsidy commitments1. the following export subsidies are subject to reduction commitments under this agreement:(a) the provision by governments or their agencies of direct subsidies, including payments-in-kind, to a firm, to an industry, to producers of an agricultural product, to a cooperative or other association of such producers, or to a marketing board, contingent on export performance;(b) the sale or disposal for export by governments or their agencies of non-commercial stocks of agricultural products at a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic market;(c) payments on the export of an agricultural product that are financed by virtue of governmental action, whether or not a charge on the public account is involved, including payments that are financed from the proceeds of a levy imposed on the agricultural product concerned or on an agricultural product from which the exported product is derived;(d) the provision of subsidies to reduce the costs of marketing exports of agricultural products (other than widely available export promotion and advisory services) including handling, upgrading and other processing costs, and the costs of international transport and freight;(e) internal transport and freight charges on export shipments, provided or mandated by governments, on terms more favourable than for domestic shipments;(f) subsidies on agricultural products contingent on their incorporation in exported products.2. (a) except as provided in subparagraph (b), the export subsidy commitment levels for each year of the implementation period, as specified in a member's schedule, represent with respect to the export subsidies listed in paragraph 1 of this article:(i) in the case of budgetary outlay reduction commitments, the maximum level of expenditure for such subsidies that may be allocated or incurred in that year in respect of the agricultural product, or group of products, concerned;

reduction commitment on domestic support.6. for each basic agricultural product, a specific ams shall be established, expressed in total monetary value terms.7. the ams shall be calculated as close as practicable to the point of first sale of the basic agricultural product concerned. measures directed at agricultural processors shall be included to the extent that such measures benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products.8. market price support: market price support shall be calculated using the gap between a fixed external reference price and the applied administered price multiplied by the quantity of production eligible to receive the applied administered price. budgetary payments made to maintain this gap, such as buying-in or storage costs, shall not be included in the ams.9. the fixed external reference price shall be based on the years 1986 to 1988 and shall generally be the average f.o.b. unit value for the basic agricultural product concerned in a net exporting country and the average c.i.f. unit value for the basic agricultural product concerned in a net importing country in the base period. the fixed reference price may be adjusted for quality differences as necessary.10. non-exempt direct payments: non-exempt direct payments which are dependent on a price gap shall be calculated either using the gap between the fixed reference price and the applied administered price multiplied by the quantity of production eligible to receive the administered price, or using budgetary outlays.11. the fixed reference price shall be based on the years 1986 to 1988 and shall generally be the actual price used for determining payment rates.12. non-exempt direct payments which are based on factors other than price shall be measured using budgetary outlays.13. other non-exempt measures, including input subsidies and other measures such as marketing-cost reduction measures: the value of such measures shall be measured using government budgetary outlays or, where the use of budgetary outlays does not reflect the full extent of the subsidy concerned, the basis for calculating the subsidy shall be the gap between the price of the subsidized good or service and a representative market price for a similar good or service multiplied by the quantity of the good or service ANNEX 4domestic support: calculation of equivalent measurement of support1. subject to the provisions of article 6, equivalent measurements of support shall be calculated in respect of all basic agricultural products where market price support as defined in annex 3 exists but for which calculation of this component of the ams is not practicable. for such products the base level for implementation of the domestic support reduction commitments shall consist of a market price support component expressed in terms of equivalent measurements of support under paragraph 2 below, as well as any non-exempt direct payments and other non-exempt support, which shall be evaluated as provided for under paragraph 3 below. support at both national and sub-national level shall be included.2. the equivalent measurements of support provided for in paragraph 1 shall be calculated on a product-specific basis for all basic agricultural products as close as practicable to the point of first sale receiving market price support and for which the calculation of the market price support component of the ams is not practicable. for those basic agricultural products, equivalent measurements of market price support shall be made using the applied administered price and the quantity of production eligible to receive that price or, where this is not practicable, on budgetary outlays used to maintain the producer price.3. where basic agricultural products falling under paragraph 1 are the subject of non-exempt direct payments or any other product-specific subsidy not exempted from the reduction commitment, the basis for equivalent measurements of support concerning these measures shall be calculations as for the corresponding ams components (specified in paragraphs 10 through 13 of annex 3).4. equivalent measurements of support shall be calculated on the amount of subsidy as close as practicable to the point of first sale of the basic agricultural product concerned. measures directed at agricultural processors shall be included to the extent that such measures benefit the producers of the basic agricultural products. specific agricultural levies or fees paid by producers shall reduce the equivalent measurements of support by a corresponding amount ANNEX 5special treatment with respect to paragraph 2 of article 4section a1. the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 4 shall not apply with effect from the entry into force of the wto agreement to any primary agricultural product and its worked and/or prepared products ("designated products") in respect of which the following conditions are complied with (hereinafter referred to as "special treatment"):(a) imports of the designated products comprised less than 3 per cent of corresponding domestic consumption in the base period 1986-1988 ("the base period");(b) no export subsidies have been provided since the beginning of the base period for the designated products;(c) effective production-restricting measures are applied to the primary agricultural product;(d) such products are designated with the symbol "st-annex 5" in section i-b of part i of a member's schedule annexed to the marrakesh protocol, as being subject to special treatment reflecting factors of non-trade concerns, such as food security and environmental protection; and(e) minimum access opportunities in respect of the designated products correspond, as specified in section i-b of part i of the schedule of the member concerned, to 4 per cent of base period domestic consumption of the designated products from the beginning of the first year of the implementation period and, thereafter, are increased by 0.8 per cent of corresponding domestic consumption in the base period per year for the remainder of the implementation period.2. at the beginning of any year of the implementation period a member may cease to apply special treatment in respect of the designated products by complying with the provisions of paragraph 6. in such a case, the member concerned shall maintain the minimum access opportunities already in effect at such time and increase the minimum access opportunities by 0.4 per cent of corresponding domestic consumption in the base period per year for the remainder of the implementation period. thereafter, the level of minimum access opportunities resulting from this formula in the final year of the implementation period shall be maintained in the schedule of the member concerned.3. any negotiation on the question of whether there can be a continuation of the special treatment as set out in paragraph 1 after the end of the implementation period shall be completed within the time-frame of the implementation period itself as a part of the negotiations set out in article 20 of this agreement, taking into account the factors of non-trade concerns.4. if it is agreed as a result of the negotiation referred to in paragraph 3 that a member may continue to apply the special treatment, such member shall confer additional and acceptable concessions as determined in that negotiation.5. where the special treatment is not to be continued at the end of the implementation period, the member concerned shall implement the provisions of paragraph 6. in such a case, after the end of the implementation period the minimum access opportunities for the designated products shall be maintained at the level of 8 per cent of corresponding domestic consumption in the base period in the schedule of the member concerned.6. border measures other than ordinary customs duties maintained in respect of the designated products shall become subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 4 with effect from the beginning of the year in which the special treatment ceases to apply. such products shall be subject to ordinary customs duties, which shall be bound in the schedule of the member concerned and applied, from the beginning of the year in which special treatment ceases and thereafter, at such rates as would have been applicable had a reduction of at least 15 per cent been implemented over the implementation period in equal annual instalments. these duties shall be established on the basis of tariff equivalents to be calculated in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in the attachment hereto.section b7. the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 4 shall also not apply with effect from the entry into force of the wto agreement to a primary agricultural product that is the predominant staple in the traditional diet of a developing country member and in respect of which the following conditions, in addition to those specified in paragraph 1(a) through 1(d), as they apply to the products concerned, are complied with:(a) minimum access opportunities in respect of the products concerned, as specified in section i-b of part i of the schedule of the developing country member concerned, correspond to 1 per cent of base period domestic consumption of the products concerned from the beginning of the first year of the implementation period and are increased in equal annual instalments to 2 per cent of corresponding domestic consumption in the base period at the beginning of the fifth year of the implementation period. from the beginning of the sixth year of the implementation period, minimum access opportunities in respect of the products concerned correspond to 2 per cent of corresponding domestic consumption in the base period and are increased in equal annual instalments to 4 per cent of corresponding domestic consumption in the base period until the beginning of the 10th year. thereafter, the level of minimum access opportunities resulting from this formula in the 10th year shall be maintained in the schedule of the developing country member concerned;(b) appropriate market access opportunities have been provided for in other products under this agreement.8. any negotiation on the question of whether there can be a continuation of the special treatment as set out in paragraph 7 after the end of the 10th year following the beginning of the implementation period shall be initiated and completed within the time-frame of the 10th year itself following the beginning of the implementation period.9. if it is agreed as a result of the negotiation referred to in paragraph 8 that a member may continue to apply the special treatment, such member shall confer additional and acceptable concessions as determined in that negotiation.10. in the event that special treatment under paragraph 7 is not to be continued beyond the 10th year following the beginning of the implementation period, the products concerned shall be subject to ordinary customs duties, established on the basis of a tariff equivalent to be calculated in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in the attachment hereto, which shall be bound in the schedule of the member concerned. in other respects, the provisions of paragraph 6 shall apply as modified by the relevant special and differential treatment accorded to developing country members under this agreement.attachment to annex 5guidelines for the calculation of tariff equivalents for the specific purpose specified in paragraphs 6 and 10 of this annex1. the calculation of the tariff equivalents, whether expressed as ad valorem or specific rates, shall be made using the actual difference between internal and external prices in a transparent manner. data used shall be for the years 1986 to 1988. tariff equivalents:(a) shall primarily be established at the four-digit level of the hs;(b) shall be established at the six-digit or a more detailed level of the hs wherever appropriate;(c) shall generally be established for worked and/or prepared products by multiplying the specific tariff equivalent(s) for the primary agricultural product(s) by the proportion(s) in value terms or in physical terms as appropriate of the primary agricultural product(s) in the worked and/or prepared products, and take account, where necessary, of any additional elements currently providing protection to industry.2. external prices shall be, in general, actual average c.i.f. unit values for the importing country. where average c.i.f. unit values are not available or appropriate, external prices shall be either:(a) appropriate average c.i.f. unit values of a near country; or(b) estimated from average f.o.b. unit values of (an) appropriate major exporter(s) adjusted by adding an estimate of insurance, freight and other relevant costs to the importing country.3. the external prices shall generally be converted to domestic currencies using the annual average market exchange rate for the same period as the price data.4. the internal price shall generally be a representative wholesale price ruling in the domestic market or an estimate of that price where adequate data is not available.5. the initial tariff equivalents may be adjusted, where necessary, to take account of differences in quality or variety using an appropriate coefficient.6. where a tariff equivalent resulting from these guidelines is negative or lower than the current bound rate, the initial tariff equivalent may be established at the current bound rate or on the basis of national offers for that product.7. where an adjustment is made to the level of a tariff equivalent which would have resulted from the above guidelines, the member concerned shall afford, on request, full opportunities for consultation with a view to negotiating appropriate solutions.agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measuresmembers,reaffirming that no member should be prevented from adopting or enforcing measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, subject to the requirement that these measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between members where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on international trade;desiring to improve the human health, animal health and phytosanitary situation in all members;noting that sanitary and phytosanitary measures are often applied on the basis of bilateral agreements or protocols;desiring the establishment of a multilateral framework of rules and disciplines to guide the development, adoption and enforcement of sanitary and phytosanitary measures in order to minimize their negative effects on trade;recognizing the important contribution that international standards, guidelines and recommendations can make in this regard;desiring to further the use of harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures between members, on the basis of international standards, guidelines and recommendations developed by the relevant international organizations, including the codex alimentarius commission, the international office of epizootics, and the relevant international and regional organizations operating within the framework of the international plant protection convention, without requiring members to change their appropriate level of protection of human, animal or plant life or health;recognizing that developing country members may encounter special difficulties in complying with the sanitary or phytosanitary measures of importing members, and as a consequence in access to markets, and also in the formulation and application of sanitary or phytosanitary measures in their own territories, and desiring to assist them in their endeavours in this regard;desiring therefore to elaborate rules for the application of the provisions of gatt 1994 which relate to the use of sanitary or phytosanitary measures, in particular the provisions of article xx(b)[14];hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1general provisions1. this agreement applies to all sanitary and phytosanitary measures which may, directly or indirectly, affect international trade. such measures shall be developed and applied in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.2. for the purposes of this agreement, the definitions provided in annex a shall apply.3. the annexes are an integral part of this agreement.4. nothing in this agreement shall affect the rights of members under the agreement on technical barriers to trade with respect to measures not within the scope of this agreement ARTICLE 2basic rights and obligations1. members have the right to take sanitary and phytosanitary measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement.2. members shall ensure that any sanitary or phytosanitary measure is applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, is based on scientific principles and is not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence, except as provided for in paragraph 7 of article 5.3. members shall ensure that their sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between members where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between their own territory and that of other members. sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on international trade.4. sanitary or phytosanitary measures which conform to the relevant provisions of this agreement shall be presumed to be in accordance with the obligations of the members under the provisions of gatt 1994 which relate to the use of sanitary or phytosanitary measures, in particular the provisions of article xx(b) ARTICLE 3harmonization1. to harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this agreement, and in particular in paragraph 3.2. sanitary or phytosanitary measures which conform to international standards, guidelines or recommendations shall be deemed to be necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and presumed to be consistent with the relevant provisions of this agreement and of gatt 1994.3. members may introduce or maintain sanitary or phytosanitary measures which result in a higher level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection than would be achieved by measures based on the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations, if there is a scientific justification, or as a consequence of the level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection a member determines to be appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraphs 1 through 8 of article 5.[15] notwithstanding the above, all measures which result in a level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection different from that which would be achieved by measures based on international standards, guidelines or recommendations shall not be inconsistent with any other provision of this agreement.4. members shall play a full part, within the limits of their resources, in the relevant international organizations and their subsidiary bodies, in particular the codex alimentarius commission, the international office of epizootics, and the international and regional organizations operating within the framework of the international plant protection convention, to promote within these organizations the development and periodic review of standards, guidelines and recommendations with respect to all aspects of sanitary and phytosanitary measures.5. the committee on sanitary and phytosanitary measures provided for in paragraphs 1 and 4 of article 12 (referred to in this agreement as the "committee") shall develop a procedure to monitor the process of international harmonization and coordinate efforts in this regard with the relevant international organizations ARTICLE 4equivalence1. members shall accept the sanitary or phytosanitary measures of other members as equivalent, even if these measures differ from their own or from those used by other members trading in the same product, if the exporting member objectively demonstrates to the importing member that its measures achieve the importing member's appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection. for this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing member for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.2. members shall, upon request, enter into consultations with the aim of achieving bilateral and multilateral agreements on recognition of the equivalence of specified sanitary or phytosanitary measures ARTICLE 5assessment of risk and determination of the appropriate level of sanitaryor phytosanitary protection1. members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant international organizations.2. in the assessment of risks, members shall take into account available scientific evidence; relevant processes and production methods; relevant inspection, sampling and testing methods; prevalence of specific diseases or pests; existence of pest- or disease-free areas; relevant ecological and environmental conditions; and quarantine or other treatment.3. in assessing the risk to animal or plant life or health and determining the measure to be applied for achieving the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection from such risk, members shall take into account as relevant economic factors: the potential damage in terms of loss of production or sales in the event of the entry, establishment or spread of a pest or disease; the costs of control or eradication in the territory of the importing member; and the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to limiting risks.4. members should, when determining the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection, take into account the objective of minimizing negative trade effects.5. with the objective of achieving consistency in the application of the concept of appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection against risks to human life or health, or to animal and plant life or health, each member shall avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in the levels it considers to be appropriate in different situations, if such distinctions result in discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade. members shall cooperate in the committee, in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of article 12, to develop guidelines to further the practical implementation of this provision. in developing the guidelines, the committee shall take into account all relevant factors, including the exceptional character of human health risks to which people voluntarily expose themselves.6. without prejudice to paragraph 2 of article 3, when establishing or maintaining sanitary or phytosanitary measures to achieve the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection, members shall ensure that such measures are not more trade-restrictive than required to achieve their appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection, taking into account technical and economic feasibility.[16]7. in cases where relevant scientific evidence is insufficient, a member may provisionally adopt sanitary or phytosanitary measures on the basis of available pertinent information, including that from the relevant international organizations as well as from sanitary or phytosanitary measures applied by other members. in such circumstances, members shall seek to obtain the additional information necessary for a more objective assessment of risk and review the sanitary or phytosanitary measure accordingly within a reasonable period of time.8. when a member has reason to believe that a specific sanitary or phytosanitary measure introduced or maintained by another member is constraining, or has the potential to constrain, its exports and the measure is not based on the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations, or such standards, guidelines or recommendations do not exist, an explanation of the reasons for such sanitary or phytosanitary measure may be requested and shall be provided by the member maintaining the measure ARTICLE 6adaptation to regional conditions, including pest- or disease-free areas and areasof low pest or disease prevalence1. members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are adapted to the sanitary or phytosanitary characteristics of the area - whether all of a country, part of a country, or all or parts of several countries - from which the product originated and to which the product is destined. in assessing the sanitary or phytosanitary characteristics of a region, members shall take into account, inter alia, the level of prevalence of specific diseases or pests, the existence of eradication or control programmes, and appropriate criteria or guidelines which may be developed by the relevant international organizations.2. members shall, in particular, recognize the concepts of pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence. determination of such areas shall be based on factors such as geography, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance, and the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary controls.3. exporting members claiming that areas within their territories are pest- or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence shall provide the necessary evidence thereof in order to objectively demonstrate to the importing member that such areas are, and are likely to remain, pest- or disease-free areas or areas of low pest or disease prevalence, respectively. for this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing member for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures ARTICLE 7transparencymembers shall notify changes in their sanitary or phytosanitary measures and shall provide information on their sanitary or phytosanitary measures in accordance with the provisions of annex b ARTICLE 8control, inspection and approval proceduresmembers shall observe the provisions of annex c in the operation of control, inspection and approval procedures, including national systems for approving the use of additives or for establishing tolerances for contaminants in foods, beverages or feedstuffs, and otherwise ensure that their procedures are not inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement ARTICLE 9technical assistance1. members agree to facilitate the provision of technical assistance to other members, especially developing country members, either bilaterally or through the appropriate international organizations. such assistance may be, inter alia, in the areas of processing technologies, research and infrastructure, including in the establishment of national regulatory bodies, and may take the form of advice, credits, donations and grants, including for the purpose of seeking technical expertise, training and equipment to allow such countries to adjust to, and comply with, sanitary or phytosanitary measures necessary to achieve the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection in their export markets.2. where substantial investments are required in order for an exporting developing country member to fulfil the sanitary or phytosanitary requirements of an importing member, the latter shall consider providing such technical assistance as will permit the developing country member to maintain and expand its market access opportunities for the product involved ARTICLE 10special and differential treatment1. in the preparation and application of sanitary or phytosanitary measures, members shall take account of the special needs of developing country members, and in particular of the least-developed country members.2. where the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection allows scope for the phased introduction of new sanitary or phytosanitary measures, longer time-frames for compliance should be accorded on products of interest to developing country members so as to maintain opportunities for their exports.3. with a view to ensuring that developing country members are able to comply with the provisions of this agreement, the committee is enabled to grant to such countries, upon request, specified, time-limited exceptions in whole or in part from obligations under this agreement, taking into account their financial, trade and development needs.4. members should encourage and facilitate the active participation of developing country members in the relevant international organizations ARTICLE 11consultations and dispute settlement1. the provisions of articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1994 as elaborated and applied by the dispute settlement understanding shall apply to consultations and the settlement of disputes under this agreement, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.2. in a dispute under this agreement involving scientific or technical issues, a panel should seek advice from experts chosen by the panel in consultation with the parties to the dispute. to this end, the panel may, when it deems it appropriate, establish an advisory technical experts group, or consult the relevant international organizations, at the request of either party to the dispute or on its own initiative.3. nothing in this agreement shall impair the rights of members under other international agreements, including the right to resort to the good offices or dispute settlement mechanisms of other international organizations or established under any international agreement ARTICLE 12administration1. a committee on sanitary and phytosanitary measures is hereby established to provide a regular forum for consultations. it shall carry out the functions necessary to implement the provisions of this agreement and the furtherance of its objectives, in particular with respect to harmonization. the committee shall reach its decisions by consensus.2. the committee shall encourage and facilitate ad hoc consultations or negotiations among members on specific sanitary or phytosanitary issues. the committee shall encourage the use of international standards, guidelines or recommendations by all members and, in this regard, shall sponsor technical consultation and study with the objective of increasing coordination and integration between international and national systems and approaches for approving the use of food additives or for establishing tolerances for contaminants in foods, beverages or feedstuffs.3. the committee shall maintain close contact with the relevant international organizations in the field of sanitary and phytosanitary protection, especially with the codex alimentarius commission, the international office of epizootics, and the secretariat of the international plant protection convention, with the objective of securing the best available scientific and technical advice for the administration of this agreement and in order to ensure that unnecessary duplication of effort is avoided.4. the committee shall develop a procedure to monitor the process of international harmonization and the use of international standards, guidelines or recommendations. for this purpose, the committee should, in conjunction with the relevant international organizations, establish a list of international standards, guidelines or recommendations relating to sanitary or phytosanitary measures which the committee determines to have a major trade impact. the list should include an indication by members of those international standards, guidelines or recommendations which they apply as conditions for import or on the basis of which imported products conforming to these standards can enjoy access to their markets. for those cases in which a member does not apply an international standard, guideline or recommendation as a condition for import, the member should provide an indication of the reason therefor, and, in particular, whether it considers that the standard is not stringent enough to provide the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection. if a member revises its position, following its indication of the use of a standard, guideline or recommendation as a condition for import, it should provide an explanation for its change and so inform the secretariat as well as the relevant international organizations, unless such notification and explanation is given according to the procedures of annex b.5. in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, the committee may decide, as appropriate, to use the information generated by the procedures, particularly for notification, which are in operation in the relevant international organizations.6. the committee may, on the basis of an initiative from one of the members, through appropriate channels invite the relevant international organizations or their subsidiary bodies to examine specific matters with respect to a particular standard, guideline or recommendation, including the basis of explanations for non-use given according to paragraph 4.7. the committee shall review the operation and implementation of this agreement three years after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, and thereafter as the need arises. where appropriate, the committee may submit to the council for trade in goods proposals to amend the text of this agreement having regard, inter alia, to the experience gained in its implementation ARTICLE 13implementationmembers are fully responsible under this agreement for the observance of all obligations set forth herein. members shall formulate and implement positive measures and mechanisms in support of the observance of the provisions of this agreement by other than central government bodies. members shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to them to ensure that non-governmental entities within their territories, as well as regional bodies in which relevant entities within their territories are members, comply with the relevant provisions of this agreement. in addition, members shall not take measures which have the effect of, directly or indirectly, requiring or encouraging such regional or non-governmental entities, or local governmental bodies, to act in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement. members shall ensure that they rely on the services of non-governmental entities for implementing sanitary or phytosanitary measures only if these entities comply with the provisions of this agreement ARTICLE 14final provisionsthe least-developed country members may delay application of the provisions of this agreement for a period of five years following the date of entry into force of the wto agreement with respect to their sanitary or phytosanitary measures affecting importation or imported products. other developing country members may delay application of the provisions of this agreement, other than paragraph 8 of article 5 and article 7, for two years following the date of entry into force of the wto agreement with respect to their existing sanitary or phytosanitary measures affecting importation or imported products, where such application is prevented by a lack of technical expertise, technical infrastructure or resources ANNEX adefinitions[17]1. sanitary or phytosanitary measure - any measure applied:(a) to protect animal or plant life or health within the territory of the member from risks arising from the entry, establishment or spread of pests, diseases, disease-carrying organisms or disease-causing organisms;(b) to protect human or animal life or health within the territory of the member from risks arising from additives, contaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in foods, beverages or feedstuffs;(c) to protect human life or health within the territory of the member from risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants or products thereof, or from the entry, establishment or spread of pests; or(d) to prevent or limit other damage within the territory of the member from the entry, establishment or spread of pests.sanitary or phytosanitary measures include all relevant laws, decrees, regulations,

international plant protection convention; and(d) for matters not covered by the above organizations, appropriate standards, guidelines and recommendations promulgated by other relevant international organizations open for membership to all members, as identified by the committee.4. risk assessment - the evaluation of the likelihood of entry, establishment or spread of a pest or disease within the territory of an importing member according to the sanitary or phytosanitary measures which might be applied, and of the associated potential biological and economic consequences; or the evaluation of the potential for adverse effects on human or animal health arising from the presence of additives, contaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in food, beverages or feedstuffs.5. appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection - the level of protection deemed appropriate by the member establishing a sanitary or phytosanitary measure to protect human, animal or plant life or health within its territory.note: many members otherwise refer to this concept as the "acceptable level of risk".6. pest- or disease-free area - an area, whether all of a country, part of a country, or all or parts of several countries, as identified by the competent authorities, in which a specific pest or disease does not occur.note: a pest- or disease-free area may surround, be surrounded by, or be adjacent to an area - whether within part of a country or in a geographic region which includes parts of or all of several countries - in which a specific pest or disease is known to occur but is subject to regional control measures such as the establishment of protection, surveillance and buffer zones which will confine or eradicate the pest or disease in question.7. area of low pest or disease prevalence - an area, whether all of a country, part of a country, or all or parts of several countries, as identified by the competent authorities, in which a specific pest or disease occurs

ensure that all sanitary and phytosanitary regulations[18] which have been adopted are published promptly in such a manner as to enable interested members to become acquainted with them.2. except in urgent circumstances, members shall allow a reasonable interval between the publication of a sanitary or phytosanitary regulation and its entry into force in order to allow time for producers in exporting members, and particularly in developing country members, to adapt their products and methods of production to the requirements of the importing member.enquiry points3. each member shall ensure that one enquiry point exists which is responsible for the provision of answers to all reasonable questions from interested members as well as for the provision of relevant documents regarding:(a) any sanitary or phytosanitary regulations adopted or proposed within its territory;(b) any control and inspection procedures, production and quarantine treatment, pesticide tolerance and food additive approval procedures, which are operated within its territory;(c) risk assessment procedures, factors taken into consideration, as well as the determination of the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection;(d) the membership and participation of the member, or of relevant bodies within its territory, in international and regional sanitary and phytosanitary

ensure that where copies of documents are requested by interested members, they are supplied at the same price (if any), apart from the cost of delivery, as to the nationals[19] of the member concerned.notification procedures5. whenever an international standard, guideline or recommendation does not exist or the content of a proposed sanitary or phytosanitary regulation is not substantially the same as the content of an international standard, guideline or recommendation, and if the regulation may have a significant effect on trade of other members, members shall:(a) publish a notice at an early stage in such a manner as to enable interested members to become acquainted with the proposal to introduce a particular regulation;(b) notify other members, through the secretariat, of the products to be covered by the regulation together with a brief indication of the objective and rationale of the proposed regulation. such notifications shall take place at an early stage, when amendments can still be introduced and comments taken into account;(c) provide upon request to other members copies of the proposed regulation and, whenever possible, identify the parts which in substance deviate from international standards, guidelines or recommendations;(d) without discrimination, allow reasonable time for other members to make comments in writing, discuss these comments upon request, and take the comments and the results of the discussions into account.6. however, where urgent problems of health protection arise or threaten to arise for a member, that member may omit such of the steps enumerated in paragraph 5 of this annex as it finds necessary, provided that the member:(a) immediately notifies other members, through the secretariat, of the particular regulation and the products covered, with a brief indication of the objective and the rationale of the regulation, including the nature of the urgent problem(s);(b) provides, upon request, copies of the regulation to other members;(c) allows other members to make comments in writing, discusses these comments upon request, and takes the comments and the results of the discussions into account.7. notifications to the secretariat shall be in english, french or spanish.8. developed country members shall, if requested by other members, provide copies of the documents or, in case of voluminous documents, summaries of the documents covered by a specific notification in english, french or spanish.9. the secretariat shall promptly circulate copies of the notification to all members and interested international organizations and draw the attention of developing country members to any notifications relating to products of particular interest to them.10. members shall designate a single central government authority as responsible for the implementation, on the national level, of the provisions concerning notification procedures according to paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this annex.general reservations11. nothing in this agreement shall be construed as requiring:(a) the provision of particulars or copies of drafts or the publication of texts other than in the language of the member except as stated in paragraph 8 of this annex; or(b) members to disclose confidential information which would impede enforcement of sanitary or phytosanitary legislation or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises ANNEX ccontrol, inspection and approval procedures[20]1. members shall ensure, with respect to any procedure to check and ensure the fulfilment of sanitary or phytosanitary measures, that:(a) such procedures are undertaken and completed without undue delay and in no less favourable manner for imported products than for like domestic products;(b) the standard processing period of each procedure is published or that the anticipated processing period is communicated to the applicant upon request; when receiving an application, the competent body promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of all deficiencies; the competent body transmits as soon as possible the results of the procedure in a precise and complete manner to the applicant so that corrective action may be taken if necessary; even when the application has deficiencies, the competent body proceeds as far as practicable with the procedure if the applicant so requests; and that upon request, the applicant is informed of the stage of the procedure, with any delay being explained;(c) information requirements are limited to what is necessary for appropriate control, inspection and approval procedures, including for approval of the use of additives or for the establishment of tolerances for contaminants in food, beverages or feedstuffs;(d) the confidentiality of information about imported products arising from or supplied in connection with control, inspection and approval is respected in a way no less favourable than for domestic products and in such a manner that legitimate commercial interests are protected;(e) any requirements for control, inspection and approval of individual specimens of a product are limited to what is reasonable and necessary;(f) any fees imposed for the procedures on imported products are equitable in relation to any fees charged on like domestic products or products originating in any other member and should be no higher than the actual cost of the service;(g) the same criteria should be used in the siting of facilities used in the procedures and the selection of samples of imported products as for domestic products so as to minimize the inconvenience to applicants, importers, exporters or their agents;(h) whenever specifications of a product are changed subsequent to its control and inspection in light of the applicable regulations, the procedure for the modified product is limited to what is necessary to determine whether adequate confidence exists that the product still meets the regulations concerned; and(i) a procedure exists to review complaints concerning the operation of such procedures and to take corrective action when a complaint is justified.where an importing member operates a system for the approval of the use of food additives or for the establishment of tolerances for contaminants in food, beverages or feedstuffs which prohibits or restricts access to its domestic markets for products based on the absence of an approval, the importing member shall consider the use of a relevant international standard as the basis for access until a final determination is made.2. where a sanitary or phytosanitary measure specifies control at the level of production, the member in whose territory the production takes place shall provide the necessary assistance to facilitate such control and the work of the controlling authorities.3. nothing in this agreement shall prevent members from carrying out reasonable inspection within their own territories.agreement on textiles and clothingmembers,recalling that ministers agreed at punta del este that "negotiations in the area of textiles and clothing shall aim to formulate modalities that would permit the eventual integration of this sector into gatt on the basis of strengthened gatt rules and disciplines, thereby also contributing to the objective of further liberalization of trade";recalling also that in the april 1989 decision of the trade negotiations committee it was agreed that the process of integration should commence following the conclusion of the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations and should be progressive in character;recalling further that it was agreed that special treatment should be accorded to the least-developed country members;hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 11. this agreement sets out provisions to be applied by members during a transition period for the integration of the textiles and clothing sector into gatt 1994.2. members agree to use the provisions of paragraph 18 of article 2 and paragraph 6(b) of article 6 in such a way as to permit meaningful increases in access possibilities for small suppliers and the development of commercially significant trading opportunities for new entrants in the field of textiles and clothing trade.[21]3. members shall have due regard to the situation of those members which have not accepted the protocols extending the arrangement regarding international trade in textiles (referred to in this agreement as the "mfa") since 1986 and, to the extent possible, shall afford them special treatment in applying the provisions of this agreement.4. members agree that the particular interests of the cotton-producing exporting members should, in consultation with them, be reflected in the implementation of the provisions of this agreement.5. in order to facilitate the integration of the textiles and clothing sector into gatt 1994, members should allow for continuous autonomous industrial adjustment and increased competition in their markets.6. unless otherwise provided in this agreement, its provisions shall not affect the rights and obligations of members under the provisions of the wto agreement and the multilateral trade agreements.7. the textile and clothing products to which this agreement applies are set out in the annex ARTICLE 21. all quantitative restrictions within bilateral agreements maintained under article 4 or notified under article 7 or 8 of the mfa in force on the day before the entry into force of the wto agreement shall, within 60 days following such entry into force, be notified in detail, including the restraint levels, growth rates and flexibility provisions, by the members maintaining such restrictions to the textiles monitoring body provided for in article 8 (referred to in this agreement as the "tmb"). members agree that as of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, all such restrictions maintained between gatt 1947 contracting parties, and in place on the day before such entry into force, shall be governed by the provisions of this agreement.2. the tmb shall circulate these notifications to all members for their information. it is open to any member to bring to the attention of the tmb, within 60 days of the circulation of the notifications, any observations it deems appropriate with regard to such notifications. such observations shall be circulated to the other members for their information. the tmb may make recommendations, as appropriate, to the members concerned.3. when the 12-month period of restrictions to be notified under paragraph 1 does not coincide with the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, the members concerned should mutually agree on arrangements to bring the period of restrictions into line with the agreement year[22], and to establish notional base levels of such restrictions in order to implement the provisions of this article. concerned members agree to enter into consultations promptly upon request with a view to reaching such mutual agreement. any such arrangements shall take into account, inter alia, seasonal patterns of shipments in recent years. the results of these consultations shall be notified to the tmb, which shall make such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the members concerned.4. the restrictions notified under paragraph 1 shall be deemed to constitute the totality of such restrictions applied by the respective members on the day before the entry into force of the wto agreement. no new restrictions in terms of products or members shall be introduced except under the provisions of this agreement or relevant gatt 1994 provisions.[23] restrictions not notified within 60 days of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement shall be terminated forthwith.5. any unilateral measure taken under article 3 of the mfa prior to the date of entry into force of the wto agreement may remain in effect for the duration specified therein, but not exceeding 12 months, if it has been reviewed by the textiles surveillance body (referred to in this agreement as the "tsb") established under the mfa. should the tsb not have had the opportunity to review any such unilateral measure, it shall be reviewed by the tmb in accordance with the rules and procedures governing article 3 measures under the mfa. any measure applied under an mfa article 4 agreement prior to the date of entry into force of the wto agreement that is the subject of a dispute which the tsb has not had the opportunity to review shall also be reviewed by the tmb in accordance with the mfa rules and procedures applicable for such a review.6. on the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, each member shall integrate into gatt 1994 products which accounted for not less than 16 per cent of the total volume of the member's 1990 imports of the products in the annex, in terms of hs lines or categories. the products to be integrated shall encompass products from each of the following four groups: tops and yarns, fabrics, made-up textile products, and clothing.7. full details of the actions to be taken pursuant to paragraph 6 shall be notified by the members concerned according to the following:(a) members maintaining restrictions falling under paragraph 1 undertake, notwithstanding the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, to notify such details to the gatt secretariat not later than the date determined by the ministerial decision of 15 april 1994. the gatt secretariat shall promptly circulate these notifications to the other participants for information. these notifications will be made available to the tmb, when established, for the purposes of paragraph 21;(b) members which have, pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 6, retained the right to use the provisions of article 6, shall notify such details to the tmb not later than 60 days following the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, or, in the case of those members covered by paragraph 3 of article 1, not later than at the end of the 12th month that the wto agreement is in effect. the tmb shall circulate these notifications to the other members for information and review them as provided in paragraph 21.8. the remaining products, i.e. the products not integrated into gatt 1994 under paragraph 6, shall be integrated, in terms of hs lines or categories, in three stages, as follows:(a) on the first day of the 37th month that the wto agreement is in effect, products which accounted for not less than 17 per cent of the total volume of the member's 1990 imports of the products in the annex. the products to be integrated by the members shall encompass products from each of the following four groups: tops and yarns, fabrics, made-up textile products, and clothing;(b) on the first day of the 85th month that the wto agreement is in effect, products which accounted for not less than 18 per cent of the total volume of the member's 1990 imports of the products in the annex. the products to be integrated by the members shall encompass products from each of the following four groups: tops and yarns, fabrics, made-up textile products, and clothing;(c) on the first day of the 121st month that the wto agreement is in effect, the textiles and clothing sector shall stand integrated into gatt 1994, all restrictions under this agreement having been eliminated.9. members which have notified, pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 6, their intention not to retain the right to use the provisions of article 6 shall, for the purposes of this agreement, be deemed to have integrated their textiles and clothing products into gatt 1994. such members shall, therefore, be exempted from complying with the provisions of paragraphs 6 to 8 and 11.10. nothing in this agreement shall prevent a member which has submitted an integration programme pursuant to paragraph 6 or 8 from integrating products into gatt 1994 earlier than provided for in such a programme. however, any such integration of products shall take effect at the beginning of an agreement year, and details shall be notified to the tmb at least three months prior thereto for circulation to all members.11. the respective programmes of integration, in pursuance of paragraph 8, shall be notified in detail to the tmb at least 12 months before their coming into effect, and circulated by the tmb to all members.12. the base levels of the restrictions on the remaining products, mentioned in paragraph 8, shall be the restraint levels referred to in paragraph 1.13. during stage 1 of this agreement (from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement to the 36th month that it is in effect, inclusive) the level of each restriction under mfa bilateral agreements in force for the 12-month period prior to the date of entry into force of the wto agreement shall be increased annually by not less than the growth rate established for the respective restrictions, increased by 16 per cent.14. except where the council for trade in goods or the dispute settlement body decides otherwise under paragraph 12 of article 8, the level of each remaining restriction shall be increased annually during subsequent stages of this agreement by not less than the following:(a) for stage 2 (from the 37th to the 84th month that the wto agreement is in effect, inclusive), the growth rate for the respective restrictions during stage 1, increased by 25 per cent;(b) for stage 3 (from the 85th to the 120th month that the wto agreement is in effect, inclusive), the growth rate for the respective restrictions during stage 2, increased by 27 per cent.15. nothing in this agreement shall prevent a member from eliminating any restriction maintained pursuant to this article, effective at the beginning of any agreement year during the transition period, provided the exporting member concerned and the tmb are notified at least three months prior to the elimination coming into effect. the period for prior notification may be shortened to 30 days with the agreement of the restrained member. the tmb shall circulate such notifications to all members. in considering the elimination of restrictions as envisaged in this paragraph, the members concerned shall take into account the treatment of similar exports from other members.16. flexibility provisions, i.e. swing, carryover and carry forward, applicable to all restrictions maintained pursuant to this article, shall be the same as those provided for in mfa bilateral agreements for the 12-month period prior to the entry into force of the wto agreement. no quantitative limits shall be placed or maintained on the combined use of swing, carryover and carry forward.17. administrative arrangements, as deemed necessary in relation to the implementation of any provision of this article, shall be a matter for agreement between the members concerned. any such arrangements shall be notified to the tmb.18. as regards those members whose exports are subject to restrictions on the day before the entry into force of the wto agreement and whose restrictions represent 1.2 per cent or less of the total volume of the restrictions applied by an importing member as of 31 december 1991 and notified under this article, meaningful improvement in access for their exports shall be provided, at the entry into force of the wto agreement and for the duration of this agreement, through advancement by one stage of the growth rates set out in paragraphs 13 and 14, or through at least equivalent changes as may be mutually agreed with respect to a different mix of base levels, growth and flexibility provisions. such improvements shall be notified to the tmb.19. in any case, during the duration of this agreement, in which a safeguard measure is initiated by a member under article xix of gatt 1994 in respect of a particular product during a period of one year immediately following the integration of that product into gatt 1994 in accordance with the provisions of this article, the provisions of article xix, as interpreted by the agreement on safeguards, will apply, save as set out in paragraph 20.20. where such a measure is applied using non-tariff means, the importing member concerned shall apply the measure in a manner as set forth in paragraph 2(d) of article xiii of gatt 1994 at the request of any exporting member whose exports of such products were subject to restrictions under this agreement at any time in the one-year period immediately prior to the initiation of the safeguard measure. the exporting member concerned shall administer such a measure. the applicable level shall not reduce the relevant exports below the level of a recent representative period, which shall normally be the average of exports from the member concerned in the last three representative years for which statistics are available. furthermore, when the safeguard measure is applied for more than one year, the applicable level shall be progressively liberalized at regular intervals during the period of application. in such cases the exporting member concerned shall not exercise the right of suspending substantially equivalent concessions or other obligations under paragraph 3(a) of article xix of gatt 1994.21. the tmb shall keep under review the implementation of this article. it shall, at the request of any member, review any particular matter with reference to the implementation of the provisions of this article. it shall make appropriate recommendations or findings within 30 days to the member or members concerned, after inviting the participation of such members ARTICLE 31. within 60 days following the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, members maintaining restrictions[24] on textile and clothing products (other than restrictions maintained under the mfa and covered by the provisions of article 2), whether consistent with gatt 1994 or not, shall (a) notify them in detail to the tmb, or (b) provide to the tmb notifications with respect to them which have been submitted to any other wto body. the notifications should, wherever applicable, provide information with respect to any gatt 1994 justification for the restrictions, including gatt 1994 provisions on which they are based.2. members maintaining restrictions falling under paragraph 1, except those justified under a gatt 1994 provision, shall either:(a) bring them into conformity with gatt 1994 within one year following the entry into force of the wto agreement, and notify this action to the tmb for its information; or(b) phase them out progressively according to a programme to be presented to the tmb by the member maintaining the restrictions not later than six months after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement. this programme shall provide for all restrictions to be phased out within a period not exceeding the duration of this agreement. the tmb may make recommendations to the member concerned with respect to such a programme.3. during the duration of this agreement, members shall provide to the tmb, for its information, notifications submitted to any other wto bodies with respect to any new restrictions or changes in existing restrictions on textile and clothing products, taken under any gatt 1994 provision, within 60 days of their coming into effect.4. it shall be open to any member to make reverse notifications to the tmb, for its information, in regard to the gatt 1994 justification, or in regard to any restrictions that may not have been notified under the provisions of this article. actions with respect to such notifications may be pursued by any member under relevant gatt 1994 provisions or procedures in the appropriate wto body.5. the tmb shall circulate the notifications made pursuant to this article to all members for their information ARTICLE 41. restrictions referred to in article 2, and those applied under article 6, shall be administered by the exporting members. importing members shall not be obliged to accept shipments in excess of the restrictions notified under article 2, or of restrictions applied pursuant to article 6.2. members agree that the introduction of changes, such as changes in practices, rules, procedures and categorization of textile and clothing products, including those changes relating to the harmonized system, in the implementation or administration of those restrictions notified or applied under this agreement should not: upset the balance of rights and obligations between the members concerned under this agreement; adversely affect the access available to a member; impede the full utilization of such access; or disrupt trade under this agreement.3. if a product which constitutes only part of a restriction is notified for integration pursuant to the provisions of article 2, members agree that any change in the level of that restriction shall not upset the balance of rights and obligations between the members concerned under this agreement.4. when changes mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 are necessary, however, members agree that the member initiating such changes shall inform and, wherever possible, initiate consultations with the affected member or members prior to the implementation of such changes, with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution regarding appropriate and equitable adjustment. members further agree that where consultation prior to implementation is not feasible, the member initiating such changes will, at the request of the affected member, consult, within 60 days if possible, with the members concerned with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution regarding appropriate and equitable adjustments. if a mutually satisfactory solution is not reached, any member involved may refer the matter to the tmb for recommendations as provided in article 8. should the tsb not have had the opportunity to review a dispute concerning such changes introduced prior to the entry into force of the wto agreement, it shall be reviewed by the tmb in accordance with the rules and procedures of the mfa applicable for such a review ARTICLE 51. members agree that circumvention by transshipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning country or place of origin, and falsification of official documents, frustrates the implementation of this agreement to integrate the textiles and clothing sector into gatt 1994. accordingly, members should establish the necessary legal provisions and/or administrative procedures to address and take action against such circumvention. members further agree that, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, they will cooperate fully to address problems arising from circumvention.2. should any member believe that this agreement is being circumvented by transshipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning country or place of origin, or falsification of official documents, and that no, or inadequate, measures are being applied to address and/or to take action against such circumvention, that member should consult with the member or members concerned with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory solution. such consultations should be held promptly, and within 30 days when possible. if a mutually satisfactory solution is not reached, the matter may be referred by any member involved to the tmb for recommendations.3. members agree to take necessary action, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, to prevent, to investigate and, where appropriate, to take legal and/or administrative action against circumvention practices within their territory. members agree to cooperate fully, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, in instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention of this agreement, to establish the relevant facts in the places of import, export and, where applicable, transshipment. it is agreed that such cooperation, consistent with domestic laws and procedures, will include: investigation of circumvention practices which increase restrained exports to the member maintaining such restraints; exchange of documents, correspondence, reports and other relevant information to the extent available; and facilitation of plant visits and contacts, upon request and on a case-by-case basis. members should endeavour to clarify the circumstances of any such instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention, including the respective roles of the exporters or importers involved.4. where, as a result of investigation, there is sufficient evidence that circumvention has occurred (e.g. where evidence is available concerning the country or place of true origin, and the circumstances of such circumvention), members agree that appropriate action, to the extent necessary to address the problem, should be taken. such action may include the denial of entry of goods or, where goods have entered, having due regard to the actual circumstances and the involvement of the country or place of true origin, the adjustment of charges to restraint levels to reflect the true country or place of origin. also, where there is evidence of the involvement of the territories of the members through which the goods have been transshipped, such action may include the introduction of restraints with respect to such members. any such actions, together with their timing and scope, may be taken after consultations held with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution between the concerned members and shall be notified to the tmb with full justification. the members concerned may agree on other remedies in consultation. any such agreement shall also be notified to the tmb, and the tmb may make such recommendations to the members concerned as it deems appropriate. if a mutually satisfactory solution is not reached, any member concerned may refer the matter to the tmb for prompt review and recommendations.5. members note that some cases of circumvention may involve shipments transiting through countries or places with no changes or alterations made to the goods contained in such shipments in the places of transit. they note that it may not be generally practicable for such places of transit to exercise control over such shipments.6. members agree that false declaration concerning fibre content, quantities, description or classification of merchandise also frustrates the objective of this agreement. where there is evidence that any such false declaration has been made for purposes of circumvention, members agree that appropriate measures, consistent with domestic laws and procedures, should be taken against the exporters or importers involved. should any member believe that this agreement is being circumvented by such false declaration and that no, or inadequate, administrative measures are being applied to address and/or to take action against such circumvention, that member should consult promptly with the member involved with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory solution. if such a solution is not reached, the matter may be referred by any member involved to the tmb for recommendations. this provision is not intended to prevent members from making technical adjustments when inadvertent errors in declarations have been made ARTICLE 61. members recognize that during the transition period it may be necessary to apply a specific transitional safeguard mechanism (referred to in this agreement as "transitional safeguard"). the transitional safeguard may be applied by any member to products covered by the annex, except those integrated into gatt 1994 under the provisions of article 2. members not maintaining restrictions falling under article 2 shall notify the tmb within 60 days following the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, as to whether or not they wish to retain the right to use the provisions of this article. members which have not accepted the protocols extending the mfa since 1986 shall make such notification within 6 months following the entry into force of the wto agreement. the transitional safeguard should be applied as sparingly as possible, consistently with the provisions of this article and the effective implementation of the integration process under this agreement.2. safeguard action may be taken under this article when, on the basis of a determination by a member[25], it is demonstrated that a particular product is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing like and/or directly competitive products. serious damage or actual threat thereof must demonstrably be caused by such increased quantities in total imports of that product and not by such other factors as technological changes or changes in consumer preference.3. in making a determination of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, as referred to in paragraph 2, the member shall examine the effect of those imports on the state of the particular industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and investment; none of which, either alone or combined with other factors, can necessarily give decisive guidance.4. any measure invoked pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be applied on a member-by-member basis. the member or members to whom serious damage, or actual threat thereof, referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, is attributed, shall be determined on the basis of a sharp and substantial increase in imports, actual or imminent[26], from such a member or members individually, and on the basis of the level of imports as compared with imports from other sources, market share, and import and domestic prices at a comparable stage of commercial transaction; none of these factors, either alone or combined with other factors, can necessarily give decisive guidance. such safeguard measure shall not be applied to the exports of any member whose exports of the particular product are already under restraint under this agreement.5. the period of validity of a determination of serious damage or actual threat thereof for the purpose of invoking safeguard action shall not exceed 90 days from the date of initial notification as set forth in paragraph 7.6. in the application of the transitional safeguard, particular account shall be taken of the interests of exporting members as set out below:(a) least-developed country members shall be accorded treatment significantly more favourable than that provided to the other groups of members referred to in this paragraph, preferably in all its elements but, at least, on overall terms;(b) members whose total volume of textile and clothing exports is small in comparison with the total volume of exports of other members and who account for only a small percentage of total imports of that product into the importing member shall be accorded differential and more favourable treatment in the fixing of the economic terms provided in paragraphs 8, 13 and 14. for those suppliers, due account will be taken, pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 1, of the future possibilities for the development of their trade and the need to allow commercial quantities of imports from them;(c) with respect to wool products from wool-producing developing country members whose economy and textiles and clothing trade are dependent on the wool sector, whose total textile and clothing exports consist almost exclusively of wool products, and whose volume of textiles and clothing trade is comparatively small in the markets of the importing members, special consideration shall be given to the export needs of such members when considering quota levels, growth rates and flexibility;(d) more favourable treatment shall be accorded to re-imports by a member of textile and clothing products which that member has exported to another member for processing and subsequent reimportation, as defined by the laws and practices of the importing member, and subject to satisfactory control and certification procedures, when these products are imported from a member for which this type of trade represents a significant proportion of its total exports of textiles and clothing.7. the member proposing to take safeguard action shall seek consultations with the member or members which would be affected by such action. the request for consultations shall be accompanied by specific and relevant factual information, as up-to-date as possible, particularly in regard to: (a) the factors, referred to in paragraph 3, on which the member invoking the action has based its determination of the existence of serious damage or actual threat thereof; and (b) the factors, referred to in paragraph 4, on the basis of which it proposes to invoke the safeguard action with respect to the member or members concerned. in respect of requests made under this paragraph, the information shall be related, as closely as possible, to identifiable segments of production and to the reference period set out in paragraph 8. the member invoking the action shall also indicate the specific level at which imports of the product in question from the member or members concerned are proposed to be restrained; such level shall not be lower than the level referred to in paragraph 8. the member seeking consultations shall, at the same time, communicate to the chairman of the tmb the request for consultations, including all the relevant factual data outlined in paragraphs 3 and 4, together with the proposed restraint level. the chairman shall inform the members of the tmb of the request for consultations, indicating the requesting member, the product in question and the member having received the request. the member or members concerned shall respond to this request promptly and the consultations shall be held without delay and normally be completed within 60 days of the date on which the request was received.8. if, in the consultations, there is mutual understanding that the situation calls for restraint on the exports of the particular product from the member or members concerned, the level of such restraint shall be fixed at a level not lower than the actual level of exports or imports from the member concerned during the 12-month period terminating two months preceding the month in which the request for consultation was made.9. details of the agreed restraint measure shall be communicated to the tmb within 60 days from the date of conclusion of the agreement. the tmb shall determine whether the agreement is justified in accordance with the provisions of this article. in order to make its determination, the tmb shall have available to it the factual data provided to the chairman of the tmb, referred to in paragraph 7, as well as any other relevant information provided by the members concerned. the tmb may make such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the members concerned.10. if, however, after the expiry of the period of 60 days from the date on which the request for consultations was received, there has been no agreement between the members, the member which proposed to take safeguard action may apply the restraint by date of import or date of export, in accordance with the provisions of this article, within 30 days following the 60-day period for consultations, and at the same time refer the matter to the tmb. it shall be open to either member to refer the matter to the tmb before the expiry of the period of 60 days. in either case, the tmb shall promptly conduct an examination of the matter, including the determination of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, and its causes, and make appropriate recommendations to the members concerned within 30 days. in order to conduct such examination, the tmb shall have available to it the factual data provided to the chairman of the tmb, referred to in paragraph 7, as well as any other relevant information provided by the members concerned.11. in highly unusual and critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, action under paragraph 10 may be taken provisionally on the condition that the request for consultations and notification to the tmb shall be effected within no more than five working days after taking the action. in the case that consultations do not produce agreement, the tmb shall be notified at the conclusion of consultations, but in any case no later than 60 days from the date of the implementation of the action. the tmb shall promptly conduct an examination of the matter, and make appropriate recommendations to the members concerned within 30 days. in the case that consultations do produce agreement, members shall notify the tmb upon conclusion but, in any case, no later than 90 days from the date of the implementation of the action. the tmb may make such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the members concerned.12. a member may maintain measures invoked pursuant to the provisions of this article: (a) for up to three years without extension, or (b) until the product is integrated into gatt 1994, whichever comes first.13. should the restraint measure remain in force for a period exceeding one year, the level for subsequent years shall be the level specified for the first year increased by a growth rate of not less than 6 per cent per annum, unless otherwise justified to the tmb. the restraint level for the product concerned may be exceeded in either year of any two subsequent years by carry forward and/or carryover of 10 per cent of which carry forward shall not represent more than 5 per cent. no quantitative limits shall be placed on the combined use of carryover, carry forward and the provision of paragraph 14.14. when more than one product from another member is placed under restraint under this article by a member, the level of restraint agreed, pursuant to the provisions of this article, for each of these products may be exceeded by 7 per cent, provided that the total exports subject to restraint do not exceed the total of the levels for all products so restrained under this article, on the basis of agreed common units. where the periods of application of restraints of these products do not coincide with each other, this provision shall be applied to any overlapping period on a pro rata basis.15. if a safeguard action is applied under this article to a product for which a restraint was previously in place under the mfa during the 12-month period prior to the entry into force of the wto agreement, or pursuant to the provisions of article 2 or 6, the level of the new restraint shall be the level provided for in paragraph 8 unless the new restraint comes into force within one year of:(a) the date of notification referred to in paragraph 15 of article 2 for the elimination of the previous restraint; or(b) the date of removal of the previous restraint put in place pursuant to the provisions of this article or of the mfain which case the level shall not be less than the higher of (i) the level of restraint for the last 12-month period during which the product was under restraint, or (ii) the level of restraint provided for in paragraph 8.16. when a member which is not maintaining a restraint under article 2 decides to apply a restraint pursuant to the provisions of this article, it shall establish appropriate arrangements which: (a) take full account of such factors as established tariff classification and quantitative units based on normal commercial practices in export and import transactions, both as regards fibre composition and in terms of competing for the same segment of its domestic market, and (b) avoid over-categorization. the request for consultations referred to in paragraphs 7 or 11 shall include full information on such arrangements ARTICLE 71. as part of the integration process and with reference to the specific commitments undertaken by the members as a result of the uruguay round, all members shall take such actions as may be necessary to abide by gatt 1994 rules and disciplines so as to:(a) achieve improved access to markets for textile and clothing products through such measures as tariff reductions and bindings, reduction or elimination of non-tariff barriers, and facilitation of customs, administrative and licensing formalities;(b) ensure the application of policies relating to fair and equitable trading conditions as regards textiles and clothing in such areas as dumping and anti-dumping rules and procedures, subsidies and countervailing measures, and protection of intellectual property rights; and(c) avoid discrimination against imports in the textiles and clothing sector when taking measures for general trade policy reasons.such actions shall be without prejudice to the rights and obligations of members under gatt 1994.2. members shall notify to the tmb the actions referred to in paragraph 1 which have a bearing on the implementation of this agreement. to the extent that these have been notified to other wto bodies, a summary, with reference to the original notification, shall be sufficient to fulfil the requirements under this paragraph. it shall be open to any member to make reverse notifications to the tmb.3. where any member considers that another member has not taken the actions referred to in paragraph 1, and that the balance of rights and obligations under this agreement has been upset, that member may bring the matter before the relevant wto bodies and inform the tmb. any subsequent findings or conclusions by the wto bodies concerned shall form a part of the tmb's comprehensive report ARTICLE 81. in order to supervise the implementation of this agreement, to examine all measures taken under this agreement and their conformity therewith, and to take the actions specifically required of it by this agreement, the textiles monitoring body ("tmb") is hereby established. the tmb shall consist of a chairman and 10 members. its membership shall be balanced and broadly representative of the members and shall provide for rotation of its members at appropriate intervals. the members shall be appointed by members designated by the council for trade in goods to serve on the tmb, discharging their function on an ad personam basis.2. the tmb shall develop its own working procedures. it is understood, however, that consensus within the tmb does not require the assent or concurrence of members appointed by members involved in an unresolved issue under review by the tmb.3. the tmb shall be considered as a standing body and shall meet as necessary to carry out the functions required of it under this agreement. it shall rely on notifications and information supplied by the members under the relevant articles of this agreement, supplemented by any additional information or necessary details they may submit or it may decide to seek from them. it may also rely on notifications to and reports from other wto bodies and from such other sources as it may deem appropriate.4. members shall afford to each other adequate opportunity for consultations with respect to any matters affecting the operation of this agreement.5. in the absence of any mutually agreed solution in the bilateral consultations provided for in this agreement, the tmb shall, at the request of either member, and following a thorough and prompt consideration of the matter, make recommendations to the members concerned.6. at the request of any member, the tmb shall review promptly any particular matter which that member considers to be detrimental to its interests under this agreement and where consultations between it and the member or members concerned have failed to produce a mutually satisfactory solution. on such matters, the tmb may make such observations as it deems appropriate to the members concerned and for the purposes of the review provided for in paragraph 11.7. before formulating its recommendations or observations, the tmb shall invite participation of such members as may be directly affected by the matter in question.8. whenever the tmb is called upon to make recommendations or findings, it shall do so, preferably within a period of 30 days, unless a different time period is specified in this agreement. all such recommendations or findings shall be communicated to the members directly concerned. all such recommendations or findings shall also be communicated to the council for trade in goods for its information.9. the members shall endeavour to accept in full the recommendations of the tmb, which shall exercise proper surveillance of the implementation of such recommendations.10. if a member considers itself unable to conform with the recommendations of the tmb, it shall provide the tmb with the reasons therefor not later than one month after receipt of such recommendations. following thorough consideration of the reasons given, the tmb shall issue any further recommendations it considers appropriate forthwith. if, after such further recommendations, the matter remains unresolved, either member may bring the matter before the dispute settlement body and invoke paragraph 2 of article xxiii of gatt 1994 and the relevant provisions of the dispute settlement understanding.11. in order to oversee the implementation of this agreement, the council for trade in goods shall conduct a major review before the end of each stage of the integration process. to assist in this review, the tmb shall, at least five months before the end of each stage, transmit to the council for trade in goods a comprehensive report on the implementation of this agreement during the stage under review, in particular in matters with regard to the integration process, the application of the transitional safeguard mechanism, and relating to the application of gatt 1994 rules and disciplines as defined in articles 2, 3, 6 and 7 respectively. the tmb's comprehensive report may include any recommendation as deemed appropriate by the tmb to the council for trade in goods.12. in the light of its review the council for trade in goods shall by consensus take such decisions as it deems appropriate to ensure that the balance of rights and obligations embodied in this agreement is not being impaired. for the resolution of any disputes that may arise with respect to matters referred to in article 7, the dispute settlement body may authorize, without prejudice to the final date set out under article 9, an adjustment to paragraph 14 of article 2, for the stage subsequent to the review, with respect to any member found not to be complying with its obligations under this agreement ARTICLE 9this agreement and all restrictions thereunder shall stand terminated on the first day of the 121st month that the wto agreement is in effect, on which date the textiles and clothing sector shall be fully integrated into gatt 1994. there shall be no extension of this agreement ANNEX list of products covered by this agreement1. this annex lists textile and clothing products defined by harmonized commodity description and coding system (hs) codes at the six-digit level.2. actions under the safeguard provisions in article 6 will be taken with respect to particular textile and clothing products and not on the basis of the hs lines per se.3. actions under the safeguard provisions in article 6 of this agreement shall not apply to:(a) developing country members' exports of handloom fabrics of the cottage industry, or hand-made cottage industry products made of such handloom fabrics, or traditional folklore handicraft textile and clothing products, provided that such products are properly certified under arrangements established between the members concerned;(b) historically traded textile products which were internationally traded in commercially significant quantities prior to 1982, such as bags, sacks, carpetbacking, cordage, luggage, mats, mattings and carpets typically made from fibres such as jute, coir, sisal, abaca, maguey and henequen;(c) products made of pure silk.for such products, the provisions of article xix of gatt 1994, as interpreted by the agreement on safeguards, shall be

objectives of gatt 1994;recognizing the important contribution that international standards and conformity assessment systems can make in this regard by improving efficiency of production and facilitating the conduct of international trade;desiring therefore to encourage the development of such international standards and conformity assessment systems;desiring however to ensure that technical regulations and standards, including packaging, marking and labelling requirements, and procedures for assessment of conformity with technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade;recognizing that no country should be prevented from taking measures necessary to ensure the quality of its exports, or for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, of the environment, or for the prevention of deceptive practices, at the levels it considers appropriate, subject to the requirement that they are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on international trade, and are otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this agreement;recognizing that no country should be prevented from taking measures necessary for the protection of its essential security interest;recognizing the contribution which international standardization can make to the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries;recognizing that developing countries may encounter special difficulties in the formulation and application of technical regulations and standards and procedures for assessment of conformity with technical regulations and standards, and desiring to assist them in their endeavours in this regard;hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1general provisions1.1 general terms for standardization and procedures for assessment of conformity shall normally have the meaning given to them by definitions adopted within the united nations system and by international standardizing bodies taking into account their context and in the light of the object and purpose of this agreement.1.2 however, for the purposes of this agreement the meaning of the terms given in annex 1 applies.1.3 all products, including industrial and agricultural products, shall be subject to the provisions of this agreement.1.4 purchasing specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of governmental bodies are not subject to the provisions of this agreement but are addressed in the agreement on government procurement, according to its coverage.1.5 the provisions of this agreement do not apply to sanitary and phytosanitary measures as defined in annex a of the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures.1.6 all references in this agreement to technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures shall be construed to include any amendments thereto and any additions to the rules or the product coverage thereof, except amendments and additions of an insignificant nature.technical regulations and standards ARTICLE 2preparation, adoption and application of technical regulationsby central government bodieswith respect to their central government bodies:2.1 members shall ensure that in respect of technical regulations, products imported from the territory of any member shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to like products of national origin and to like products originating in any other country.2.2 members shall ensure that technical regulations are not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade. for this purpose, technical regulations shall not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create. such legitimate objectives are, inter alia: national security requirements; the prevention of deceptive practices; protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or the environment. in assessing such risks, relevant elements of consideration are, inter alia: available scientific and technical information, related processing technology or intended end-uses of products.2.3 technical regulations shall not be maintained if the circumstances or objectives giving rise to their adoption no longer exist or if the changed circumstances or objectives can be addressed in a less trade-restrictive manner.2.4 where technical regulations are required and relevant international standards exist or their completion is imminent, members shall use them, or the relevant parts of them, as a basis for their technical regulations except when such international standards or relevant parts would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued, for instance because of fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems.2.5 a member preparing, adopting or applying a technical regulation which may have a significant effect on trade of other members shall, upon the request of another member, explain the justification for that technical regulation in terms of the provisions of paragraphs 2 to 4. whenever a technical regulation is prepared, adopted or applied for one of the legitimate objectives explicitly mentioned in paragraph 2, and is in accordance with relevant international standards, it shall be rebuttably presumed not to create an unnecessary obstacle to international trade.2.6 with a view to harmonizing technical regulations on as wide a basis as possible, members shall play a full part, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation by appropriate international standardizing bodies of international standards for products for which they either have adopted, or expect to adopt, technical regulations.2.7 members shall give positive consideration to accepting as equivalent technical regulations of other members, even if these regulations differ from their own, provided they are satisfied that these regulations adequately fulfil the objectives of their own regulations.2.8 wherever appropriate, members shall specify technical regulations based on product requirements in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics.2.9 whenever a relevant international standard does not exist or the technical content of a proposed technical regulation is not in accordance with the technical content of relevant international standards, and if the technical regulation may have a significant effect on trade of other members, members shall:2.9.1 publish a notice in a publication at an early appropriate stage, in such a manner as to enable interested parties in other members to become acquainted with it, that they propose to introduce a particular technical regulation;2.9.2 notify other members through the secretariat of the products to be covered by the proposed technical regulation, together with a brief indication of its objective and rationale. such notifications shall take place at an early appropriate stage, when amendments can still be introduced and comments taken into account;2.9.3 upon request, provide to other members particulars or copies of the proposed technical regulation and, whenever possible, identify the parts which in substance deviate from relevant international standards;2.9.4 without discrimination, allow reasonable time for other members to make comments in writing, discuss these comments upon request, and take these written comments and the results of these discussions into account.2.10 subject to the provisions in the lead-in to paragraph 9, where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise for a member, that member may omit such of the steps enumerated in paragraph 9 as it finds necessary, provided that the member, upon adoption of a technical regulation, shall:2.10.1 notify immediately other members through the secretariat of the particular technical regulation and the products covered, with a brief indication of the objective and the rationale of the technical regulation, including the nature of the urgent problems;2.10.2 upon request, provide other members with copies of the technical regulation;2.10.3 without discrimination, allow other members to present their comments in writing, discuss these comments upon request, and take these written comments and the results of these discussions into account.2.11 members shall ensure that all technical regulations which have been adopted are published promptly or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable interested parties in other members to become acquainted with them.2.12 except in those urgent circumstances referred to in paragraph 10, members shall allow a reasonable interval between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into force in order to allow time for producers in exporting members, and particularly in developing country members, to adapt their products or methods of production to the requirements of the importing member ARTICLE 3preparation, adoption and application of technical regulationsby local government bodies and non-governmental bodieswith respect to their local government and non-governmental bodies within their territories:3.1 members shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to them to ensure compliance by such bodies with the provisions of article 2, with the exception of the obligation to notify as referred to in paragraphs 9.2 and 10.1 of article 2.3.2 members shall ensure that the technical regulations of local governments on the level directly below that of the central government in members are notified in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 9.2 and 10.1 of article 2, noting that notification shall not be required for technical regulations the technical content of which is substantially the same as that of previously notified technical regulations of central government bodies of the member concerned.3.3 members may require contact with other members, including the notifications, provision of information, comments and discussions referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10 of article 2, to take place through the central government.3.4 members shall not take measures which require or encourage local government bodies or non-governmental bodies within their territories to act in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of article 2.3.5 members are fully responsible under this agreement for the observance of all provisions of article 2. members shall formulate and implement positive measures and mechanisms in support of the observance of the provisions of article 2 by other than central government bodies ARTICLE 4preparation, adoption and application of standards4.1 members shall ensure that their central government standardizing bodies accept and comply with the code of good practice for the preparation, adoption and application of standards in annex 3 to this agreement (referred to in this agreement as the "code of good practice"). they shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to them to ensure that local government and non-governmental standardizing bodies within their territories, as well as regional standardizing bodies of which they or one or more bodies within their territories are members, accept and comply with this code of good practice. in addition, members shall not take measures which have the effect of, directly or indirectly, requiring or encouraging such standardizing bodies to act in a manner inconsistent with the code of good practice. the obligations of members with respect to compliance of standardizing bodies with the provisions of the code of good practice shall apply irrespective of whether or not a standardizing body has accepted the code of good practice.4.2 standardizing bodies that have accepted and are complying with the code of good practice shall be acknowledged by the members as complying with the principles of this agreement.conformity with technical regulations and standards ARTICLE 5procedures for assessment of conformity by central government bodies5.1 members shall ensure that, in cases where a positive assurance of conformity with technical regulations or standards is required, their central government bodies apply the following provisions to products originating in the territories of other members:5.1.1 conformity assessment procedures are prepared, adopted and applied so as to grant access for suppliers of like products originating in the territories of other members under conditions no less favourable than those accorded to suppliers of like products of national origin or originating in any other country, in a comparable situation; access entails suppliers' right to an assessment of conformity under the rules of the procedure, including, when foreseen by this procedure, the possibility to have conformity assessment activities undertaken at the site of facilities and to receive the mark of the system;5.1.2 conformity assessment procedures are not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade. this means, inter alia, that conformity assessment procedures shall not be more strict or be applied more strictly than is necessary to give the importing member adequate confidence that products conform with the applicable technical regulations or standards, taking account of the risks non-conformity would create.5.2 when implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, members shall ensure that:5.2.1 conformity assessment procedures are undertaken and completed as expeditiously as possible and in a no less favourable order for products originating in the territories of other members than for like domestic products;5.2.2 the standard processing period of each conformity assessment procedure is published or that the anticipated processing period is communicated to the applicant upon request; when receiving an application, the competent body promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of all deficiencies; the competent body transmits as soon as possible the results of the assessment in a precise and complete manner to the applicant so that corrective action may be taken if necessary; even when the application has deficiencies, the competent body proceeds as far as practicable with the conformity assessment if the applicant so requests; and that, upon request, the applicant is informed of the stage of the procedure, with any delay being explained;5.2.3 information requirements are limited to what is necessary to assess conformity and determine fees;5.2.4 the confidentiality of information about products originating in the territories of other members arising from or supplied in connection with such conformity assessment procedures is respected in the same way as for domestic products and in

action when a complaint is justified.5.3 nothing in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall prevent members from carrying out reasonable spot checks within their territories.5.4 in cases where a positive assurance is required that products conform with technical regulations or standards, and relevant guides or recommendations issued by international standardizing bodies exist or their completion is imminent, members shall ensure that central government bodies use them, or the relevant parts of them, as a basis for their conformity assessment procedures, except where, as duly explained upon request, such guides or recommendations or relevant parts are inappropriate for the members concerned, for, inter alia, such reasons as: national security requirements; the prevention of deceptive practices; protection of human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or the environment; fundamental climatic or other geographical factors; fundamental technological or infrastructural problems.5.5 with a view to harmonizing conformity assessment procedures on as wide a basis as possible, members shall play a full part, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation by appropriate international standardizing bodies of guides and recommendations for conformity assessment procedures.5.6 whenever a relevant guide or recommendation issued by an international standardizing body does

standards equivalent to their own procedures. it is recognized that prior consultations may be necessary in order to arrive at a mutually satisfactory understanding regarding, in particular:6.1.1 adequate and enduring technical competence of the relevant conformity assessment bodies in the exporting member, so that confidence in the continued reliability of their conformity assessment results can exist; in this regard, verified compliance, for instance through accreditation, with relevant guides or recommendations issued by international standardizing bodies shall be taken into account as an indication of adequate technical competence;6.1.2 limitation of the acceptance of conformity assessment results to those produced by designated bodies in the exporting member.6.2 members shall ensure that their conformity assessment procedures permit, as far as practicable, the implementation of the provisions in paragraph 1.6.3 members are encouraged, at the request of other members, to be willing to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of agreements for the mutual recognition of results of each other's conformity assessment procedures. members may require that such agreements fulfil the criteria of paragraph 1 and give mutual satisfaction regarding their potential for facilitating trade in the products concerned.6.4 members are encouraged to permit participation of

requesting members and in particular of the least-developed country members.12.8 it is recognized that developing country members may face special problems, including institutional and infrastructural problems, in the field of preparation and application of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures. it is further recognized that the special development and trade needs of developing country members, as well as their stage of technological development, may hinder their ability to discharge fully their obligations under this agreement. members, therefore, shall take this fact fully into account. accordingly, with a view to ensuring that developing country members are able to comply with this agreement, the committee on technical barriers to trade provided for in article 13 (referred to in this agreement as the "committee") is enabled to grant, upon request, specified, time-limited exceptions in whole or in part from obligations under this agreement. when considering such requests the committee shall take into account the special problems, in the field of preparation and application of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment

obligations under this agreement. the committee shall, in particular, take into account the special problems of the least-developed country members.12.9 during consultations, developed country members shall bear in mind the special difficulties experienced by developing country members in formulating and implementing standards and technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and in their desire to assist developing country members with their efforts in this direction, developed country members shall take account of the special needs of the former in regard to financing, trade

world trade and to facilitate investment across international frontiers so as to increase the economic growth of all trading partners, particularly developing country members, while ensuring free competition;taking into account the particular trade, development and financial needs of developing country members, particularly those of the least-developed country members;recognizing that certain investment measures can cause trade-restrictive and distorting effects;hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1coveragethis agreement applies to investment measures related to trade in goods only (referred to in this agreement as "trims") ARTICLE 2national treatment and quantitative restrictions1. without prejudice to other rights and obligations under gatt 1994, no member shall apply any trim that is inconsistent with the provisions of article iii or article xi of gatt 1994.2. an illustrative list of trims that are inconsistent with the obligation of national treatment provided for in paragraph 4 of article iii of gatt 1994 and the obligation of general elimination of quantitative restrictions provided for in paragraph 1 of article xi of gatt 1994 is contained in the annex to this agreement ARTICLE 3exceptionsall exceptions under gatt 1994 shall apply, as appropriate, to the provisions of this agreement ARTICLE 4developing country membersa developing country member shall be free to deviate temporarily from the provisions of article 2 to the extent and in such a manner as article xviii of gatt 1994, the understanding on the balance-of-payments provisions of gatt 1994, and the declaration on trade measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes adopted on 28 november 1979 (bisd 26s/205-209) permit the member to deviate from the provisions of articles iii and xi of gatt 1994 ARTICLE 5notification and transitional arrangements1. members, within 90 days of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, shall notify the council for trade in goods of all trims they are applying that are not in conformity with the provisions of this agreement. such trims of general or specific application shall be notified, along with their principal features.[28]2. each member shall eliminate all trims which are notified under paragraph 1 within two years of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement in the case of a developed country member, within five years in the case of a developing country member, and within seven years in the case of a least-developed country member.3. on request, the council for trade in goods may extend the transition period for the elimination of trims notified under paragraph 1 for a developing country member, including a least-developed country member, which demonstrates particular difficulties in implementing the provisions of this agreement. in considering such a request, the council for trade in goods shall take into account the individual development, financial and trade needs of the member in question.4. during the transition period, a member shall not modify the terms of any trim which it notifies under paragraph 1 from those prevailing at the date of entry into force of the wto agreement so as to increase the degree of inconsistency with the provisions of article 2. trims introduced less than 180 days before the date of entry into force of the wto agreement shall not benefit from the transitional arrangements provided in paragraph 2.5. notwithstanding the provisions of article 2, a member, in order not to disadvantage established enterprises which are subject to a trim notified under paragraph 1, may apply during the transition period the same trim to a new investment (i) where the products of such investment are like products to those of the established enterprises, and (ii) where necessary to avoid distorting the conditions of competition between the new investment and the established enterprises. any trim so applied to a new investment shall be notified to the council for trade in goods. the terms of such a trim shall be equivalent in their competitive effect to those applicable to the established enterprises, and it shall be terminated at the same time ARTICLE 6transparency1. members reaffirm, with respect to trims, their commitment to obligations on transparency and notification in article x of gatt 1994, in the undertaking on "notification" contained in the understanding regarding notification, consultation, dispute settlement and surveillance adopted on 28 november 1979 and in the ministerial decision on notification procedures adopted on 15 april 1994.2. each member shall notify the secretariat of the publications in which trims may be found, including those applied by regional and local governments and authorities within their territories.3. each member shall accord sympathetic consideration to requests for information, and afford adequate opportunity for consultation, on any matter arising from this agreement raised by another member. in conformity with article x of gatt 1994 no member is required to disclose information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private ARTICLE 7committee on trade-related investment measures1. a committee on trade-related investment measures (referred to in this agreement as the "committee") is hereby established, and shall be open to all members. the committee shall elect its own chairman and vice-chairman, and shall meet not less than once a year and otherwise at the request of any member.2. the committee shall carry out responsibilities assigned to it by the council for trade in goods and shall afford members the opportunity to consult on any matters relating to the operation and implementation of this agreement.3. the committee shall monitor the operation and implementation of this agreement and shall report thereon annually to the council for trade in goods ARTICLE 8consultation and dispute settlementthe provisions of articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1994, as elaborated and applied by the dispute settlement understanding, shall apply to consultations and the settlement of disputes under this agreement ARTICLE 9review by the council for trade in goodsnot later than five years after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, the council for trade in goods shall review the operation of this agreement and, as appropriate, propose to the ministerial conference amendments to its text. in the course of this review, the council for trade in goods shall consider whether the agreement should be complemented with provisions on investment policy and competition policy ANNEX illustrative list1. trims that are inconsistent with the obligation of national treatment provided for in paragraph 4 of article iii of gatt 1994 include those which are mandatory or enforceable under domestic law or under administrative rulings, or compliance with which is necessary to obtain an advantage, and which require:(a) the purchase or use by an enterprise of products of domestic origin or from any domestic source, whether specified in terms of particular products, in terms of volume or value of products, or in terms of a proportion of volume or value of its local production; or(b) that an enterprise's purchases or use of imported products be limited to an amount related to the volume or value of local products that it exports.2. trims that are inconsistent with the obligation of general elimination of quantitative restrictions provided for in paragraph 1 of article xi of gatt 1994 include those which are mandatory or enforceable under domestic law or under administrative rulings, or compliance with which is necessary to obtain an advantage, and which restrict:(a) the importation by an enterprise of products used in or related to its local production, generally or to an amount related to the volume or value of local production that it exports;(b) the importation by an enterprise of products used in or related to its local production by restricting its access to foreign exchange to an amount related to the foreign exchange inflows attributable to the enterprise; or(c) the exportation or sale for export by an enterprise of products, whether specified in terms of particular products, in terms of volume or value of products, or in terms of a proportion of volume or value of its local production.agreement on implementation of article viof the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994members hereby agree as follows:part i ARTICLE 1principlesan anti-dumping measure shall be applied only under the circumstances provided for in article vi of gatt 1994 and pursuant to investigations initiated[29] and conducted in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. the following provisions govern the application of article vi of gatt 1994 in so far as action is taken under anti-dumping legislation or regulations ARTICLE 2determination of dumping2.1 for the purpose of this agreement, a product is to be considered as being dumped, i.e. introduced into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value, if the export price of the product exported from one country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country.2.2 when there are no sales of the like product in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country or when, because of the particular market situation or the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country[30], such sales do not permit a proper comparison, the margin of dumping shall be determined by comparison with a comparable price of the like product when exported to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative, or with the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits.2.2.1 sales of the like product in the domestic market of the exporting country or sales to a third country at prices below per unit (fixed and variable) costs of production plus administrative, selling and general costs may be treated as not being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price and may be disregarded in determining normal value only if the authorities[31] determine that such sales are made within an extended period of time[32] in substantial quantities[33] and are at prices which do not provide for the recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time. if prices which are below per unit costs at the time of sale are above weighted average per unit costs for the period of investigation, such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.2.2.1.1 for the purpose of paragraph 2, costs shall normally be calculated on the basis of records kept by the exporter or producer under investigation, provided that such records are in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the product under consideration. authorities shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer in the course of the investigation provided that such allocations have been historically utilized by the exporter or producer, in particular in relation to establishing appropriate amortization and depreciation periods and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs. unless already reflected in the cost allocations under this sub-paragraph, costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those non-recurring items of cost which benefit future and/or current production, or for circumstances in which costs during the period of investigation are affected by start-up operations.[34]2.2.2 for the purpose of paragraph 2, the amounts for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits shall be based on actual data pertaining to production and sales in the ordinary course of trade of the like product by the exporter or producer under investigation. when such amounts cannot be determined on this basis, the amounts may be determined on the basis of:(i) the actual amounts incurred and realized by the exporter or producer in question in respect of production and sales in the domestic market of the country of origin of the same general category of products;(ii) the weighted average of the actual amounts incurred and realized by other exporters or producers subject to investigation in respect of production and sales of the like product in the domestic market of the country of origin;(iii) any other reasonable method, provided that the amount for profit so established shall not exceed the profit normally realized by other exporters or producers on sales of products of the same general category in the domestic market of the country of origin.2.3 in cases where there is no export price or where it appears to the authorities concerned that the export price is unreliable because of association or a compensatory arrangement between the exporter and the importer or a third party, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported products are first resold to an independent buyer, or if the products are not resold to an independent buyer, or not resold in the condition as imported, on such reasonable basis as the authorities may determine.2.4 a fair comparison shall be made between the export price and the normal value. this comparison shall be made at the same level of trade, normally at the ex-factory level, and in respect of sales made at as nearly as possible the same time. due allowance shall be made in each case, on its merits, for differences which affect price comparability, including differences in conditions and terms of sale, taxation, levels of trade, quantities, physical characteristics, and any other differences which are also demonstrated to affect price comparability.[35] in the cases referred to in paragraph 3, allowances for costs, including duties and taxes, incurred between importation and resale, and for profits accruing, should also be made. if in these cases price comparability has been affected, the authorities shall establish the normal value at a level of trade equivalent to the level of trade of the constructed export price, or shall make due allowance as warranted under this paragraph. the authorities shall indicate to the parties in question what information is necessary to ensure a fair comparison and shall not impose an unreasonable burden of proof on those parties.2.4.1 when the comparison under paragraph 4 requires a conversion of currencies, such conversion should be made using the rate of exchange on the date of sale[36], provided that when a sale of foreign currency on forward markets is directly linked to the export sale involved, the rate of exchange in the forward sale shall be used. fluctuations in exchange rates shall be ignored and in an investigation the authorities shall allow exporters at least 60 days to have adjusted their export prices to reflect sustained movements in exchange rates during the period of investigation.2.4.2 subject to the provisions governing fair comparison in paragraph 4, the existence of margins of dumping during the investigation phase shall normally be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average of prices of all comparable export transactions or by a comparison of normal value and export prices on a transaction-to-transaction basis. a normal value established on a weighted average basis may be compared to prices of individual export transactions if the authorities find a pattern of export prices which differ significantly among different purchasers, regions or time periods, and if an explanation is provided as to why such differences cannot be taken into account appropriately by the use of a weighted average-to-weighted average or transaction-to-transaction comparison.2.5 in the case where products are not imported directly from the country of origin but are exported to the importing member from an intermediate country, the price at which the products are sold from the country of export to the importing member shall normally be compared with the comparable price in the country of export. however, comparison may be made with the price in the country of origin, if, for example, the products are merely transshipped through the country of export, or such products are not produced in the country of export, or there is no comparable price for them in the country of export.2.6 throughout this agreement the term "like product" (produit similaire) shall be interpreted to mean a product which is identical, i.e. alike in all respects to the product under consideration, or in the absence of such a product, another product which, although not alike in all respects, has characteristics closely resembling those of the product under consideration.2.7 this article is without prejudice to the second supplementary provision to paragraph 1 of article vi in annex i to gatt 1994 ARTICLE 3determination of injury[37]3.1 a determination of injury for purposes of article vi of gatt 1994 shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of both (a) the volume of the dumped imports and the effect of the dumped imports on prices in the domestic market for like products, and (b) the consequent impact of these imports on domestic producers of such products.3.2 with regard to the volume of the dumped imports, the investigating authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant increase in dumped imports, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the importing member. with regard to the effect of the dumped imports on prices, the investigating authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the dumped imports as compared with the price of a like product of the importing member, or whether the effect of such imports is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. no one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance.3.3 where imports of a product from more than one country are simultaneously subject to anti-dumping investigations, the investigating authorities may cumulatively assess the effects of such imports only if they determine that (a) the margin of dumping established in relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as defined in paragraph 8 of article 5 and the volume of imports from each country is not negligible and (b) a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported products and the like domestic product.3.4 the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the domestic industry concerned shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including actual and potential decline in sales, profits, output, market share, productivity, return on investments, or utilization of capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; the magnitude of the margin of dumping; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments. this list is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance.3.5 it must be demonstrated that the dumped imports are, through the effects of dumping, as set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4, causing injury within the meaning of this agreement. the demonstration of a causal relationship between the dumped imports and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence before the authorities. the authorities shall also examine any known factors other than the dumped imports which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the dumped imports. factors which may be relevant in this respect include, inter alia, the volume and prices of imports not sold at dumping prices, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption, trade restrictive practices of and competition between the foreign and domestic producers, developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry.3.6 the effect of the dumped imports shall be assessed in relation to the domestic production of the like product when available data permit the separate identification of that production on the basis of such criteria as the production process, producers' sales and profits. if such separate identification of that production is not possible, the effects of the dumped imports shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes the like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.3.7 a determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. the change in circumstances which would create a situation in which the dumping would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent.[38] in making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, the authorities should consider, inter alia, such factors as:(i) a significant rate of increase of dumped imports into the domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially increased importation;(ii) sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of the exporter indicating the likelihood of substantially increased dumped exports to the importing member's market, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports;(iii) whether imports are entering at prices that will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and would likely increase demand for further imports; and(iv) inventories of the product being investigated.no one of these factors by itself can necessarily give decisive guidance but the totality of the factors considered must lead to the conclusion that further dumped exports are imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur.3.8 with respect to cases where injury is threatened by dumped imports, the application of anti-dumping measures shall be considered and decided with special care ARTICLE 4definition of domestic industry4.1 for the purposes of this agreement, the term "domestic industry" shall be interpreted as referring to the domestic producers as a whole of the like products or to those of them whose collective output of the products constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of those products, except that:(i) when producers are related[39] to the exporters or importers or are themselves importers of the allegedly dumped product, the term "domestic industry" may be interpreted as referring to the rest of the producers;(ii) in exceptional circumstances the territory of a member may, for the production in question, be divided into two or more competitive markets and the producers within each market may be regarded as a separate industry if (a) the producers within such market sell all or almost all of their production of the product in question in that market, and (b) the demand in that market is not to any substantial degree supplied by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the territory. in such circumstances, injury may be found to exist even where a major portion of the total domestic industry is not injured, provided there is a concentration of dumped imports into such an isolated market and provided further that the dumped imports are causing injury to the producers of all or almost all of the production within such market.4.2 when the domestic industry has been interpreted as referring to the producers in a certain area, i.e. a market as defined in paragraph 1(ii), anti-dumping duties shall be levied[40] only on the products in question consigned for final consumption to that area. when the constitutional law of the importing member does not permit the levying of anti-dumping duties on such a basis, the importing member may levy the anti-dumping duties without limitation only if (a) the exporters shall have been given an opportunity to cease exporting at dumped prices to the area concerned or otherwise give assurances pursuant to article 8 and adequate assurances in this regard have not been promptly given, and (b) such duties cannot be levied only on products of specific producers which supply the area in question.4.3 where two or more countries have reached under the provisions of paragraph 8(a) of article xxiv of gatt 1994 such a level of integration that they have the characteristics of a single, unified market, the industry in the entire area of integration shall be taken to be the domestic industry referred to in paragraph 1.4.4 the provisions of paragraph 6 of article 3 shall be applicable to this article ARTICLE 5initiation and subsequent investigation5.1 except as provided for in paragraph 6, an investigation to determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged dumping shall be initiated upon a written application by or on behalf of the domestic industry.5.2 an application under paragraph 1 shall include evidence of (a) dumping, (b) injury within the meaning of article vi of gatt 1994 as interpreted by this agreement and (c) a causal link between the dumped imports and the alleged injury. simple assertion, unsubstantiated by relevant evidence, cannot be considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. the application shall contain such information as is reasonably available to the applicant on the following:(i) the identity of the applicant and a description of the volume and value of the domestic production of the like product by the applicant. where a written application is made on behalf of the domestic industry, the application shall identify the industry on behalf of which the application is made by a list of all known domestic producers of the like product (or associations of domestic producers of the like product) and, to the extent possible, a description of the volume and value of domestic production of the like product accounted for by such producers;(ii) a complete description of the allegedly dumped product, the names of the country or countries of origin or export in question, the identity of each known exporter or foreign producer and a list of known persons importing the product in question;(iii) information on prices at which the product in question is sold when destined for consumption in the domestic markets of the country or countries of origin or export (or, where appropriate, information on the prices at which the product is sold from the country or countries of origin or export to a third country or countries, or on the constructed value of the product) and information on export prices or, where appropriate, on the prices at which the product is first resold to an independent buyer in the territory of the importing member;(iv) information on the evolution of the volume of the allegedly dumped imports, the effect of these imports on prices of the like product in the domestic market and the consequent impact of the imports on the domestic industry, as demonstrated by relevant factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the domestic industry, such as those listed in paragraphs 2 and 4 of article 3.5.3 the authorities shall examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the application to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation.5.4 an investigation shall not be initiated pursuant to paragraph 1 unless the authorities have determined, on the basis of an examination of the degree of support for, or opposition to, the application expressed[41] by domestic producers of the like product, that the application has been made by or on behalf of the domestic industry.[42] the application shall be considered to have been made "by or on behalf of the domestic industry" if it is supported by those domestic producers whose collective output constitutes more than 50 per cent of the total production of the like product produced by that portion of the domestic industry expressing either support for or opposition to the application. however, no investigation shall be initiated when domestic producers expressly supporting the application account for less than 25 per cent of total production of the like product produced by the domestic industry.5.5 the authorities shall avoid, unless a decision has been made to initiate an investigation, any publicizing of the application for the initiation of an investigation. however, after receipt of a properly documented application and before proceeding to initiate an investigation, the authorities shall notify the government of the exporting member concerned.5.6 if, in special circumstances, the authorities concerned decide to initiate an investigation without having received a written application by or on behalf of a domestic industry for the initiation of such investigation, they shall proceed only if they have sufficient evidence of dumping, injury and a causal link, as described in paragraph 2, to justify the initiation of an investigation.5.7 the evidence of both dumping and injury shall be considered simultaneously (a) in the decision whether or not to initiate an investigation, and (b) thereafter, during the course of the investigation, starting on a date not later than the earliest date on which in accordance with the provisions of this agreement provisional measures may be applied.5.8 an application under paragraph 1 shall be rejected and an investigation shall be terminated promptly as soon as the authorities concerned are satisfied that there is not sufficient evidence of either dumping or of injury to justify proceeding with the case. there shall be immediate termination in cases where the authorities determine that the margin of dumping is de minimis, or that the volume of dumped imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible. the margin of dumping shall be considered to be de minimis if this margin is less than 2 per cent, expressed as a percentage of the export price. the volume of dumped imports shall normally be regarded as negligible if the volume of dumped imports from a particular country is found to account for less than 3 per cent of imports of the like product in the importing member, unless countries which individually account for less than 3 per cent of the imports of the like product in the importing member collectively account for more than 7 per cent of imports of the like product in the importing member.5.9 an anti-dumping proceeding shall not hinder the procedures of customs clearance.5.10 investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded within one year, and in no case more than 18 months, after their initiation ARTICLE 6evidence6.1 all interested parties in an anti-dumping investigation shall be given notice of the information which the authorities require and ample opportunity to present in writing all evidence which they consider relevant in respect of the investigation in question.6.1.1 exporters or foreign producers receiving questionnaires used in an anti-dumping investigation shall be given at least 30 days for reply.[43] due consideration should be given to any request for an extension of the 30-day period and, upon cause shown, such an extension should be granted whenever practicable.6.1.2 subject to the requirement to protect confidential information, evidence presented in writing by one interested party shall be made available promptly to other interested parties participating in the investigation.6.1.3 as soon as an investigation has been initiated, the authorities shall provide the full text of the written application received under paragraph 1 of article 5 to the known exporters[44] and to the authorities of the exporting member and shall make it available, upon request, to other interested parties involved. due regard shall be paid to the requirement for the protection of confidential information, as provided for in paragraph 5.6.2 throughout the anti-dumping investigation all interested parties shall have a full opportunity for the defence of their interests. to this end, the authorities shall, on request, provide opportunities for all interested parties to meet those parties with adverse interests, so that opposing views may be presented and rebuttal arguments offered. provision of such opportunities must take account of the need to preserve confidentiality and of the convenience to the parties. there shall be no obligation on any party to attend a meeting, and failure to do so shall not be prejudicial to that party's case. interested parties shall also have the right, on justification, to present other information orally.6.3 oral information provided under paragraph 2 shall be taken into account by the authorities only in so far as it is subsequently reproduced in writing and made available to other interested parties, as provided for in subparagraph 1.2.6.4 the authorities shall whenever practicable provide timely opportunities for all interested parties to see all information that is relevant to the presentation of their cases, that is not confidential as defined in paragraph 5, and that is used by the authorities in an anti-dumping investigation, and to prepare presentations on the basis of this information.6.5 any information which is by nature confidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom that person acquired the information), or which is provided on a confidential basis by parties to an investigation shall, upon good cause shown, be treated as such by the authorities. such information shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting it.[45]6.5.1 the authorities shall require interested parties providing confidential information to furnish non-confidential summaries thereof. these summaries shall be in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence. in exceptional circumstances, such parties may indicate that such information is not susceptible of summary. in such exceptional circumstances, a statement of the reasons why summarization is not possible must be provided.6.5.2 if the authorities find that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier of the information is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summary form, the authorities may disregard such information unless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the information is correct.[46]6.6 except in circumstances provided for in paragraph 8, the authorities shall during the course of an investigation satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the information supplied by interested parties upon which their findings are based.6.7 in order to verify information provided or to obtain further details, the authorities may carry out investigations in the territory of other members as required, provided they obtain the agreement of the firms concerned and notify the representatives of the government of the member in question, and unless that member objects to the investigation. the procedures described in annex i shall apply to investigations carried out in the territory of other members. subject to the requirement to protect confidential information, the authorities shall make the results of any such investigations available, or shall provide disclosure thereof pursuant to paragraph 9, to the firms to which they pertain and may make such results available to the applicants.6.8 in cases in which any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, necessary information within a reasonable period or significantly impedes the investigation, preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative, may be made on the basis of the facts available. the provisions of annex ii shall be observed in the application of this paragraph.6.9 the authorities shall, before a final determination is made, inform all interested parties of the essential facts under consideration which form the basis for the decision whether to apply definitive measures. such disclosure should take place in sufficient time for the parties to defend their interests.6.10 the authorities shall, as a rule, determine an individual margin of dumping for each known exporter or producer concerned of the product under investigation. in cases where the number of exporters, producers, importers or types of products involved is so large as to make such a determination impracticable, the authorities may limit their examination either to a reasonable number of interested parties or products by using samples which are statistically valid on the basis of information available to the authorities at the time of the selection, or to the largest percentage of the volume of the exports from the country in question which can reasonably be investigated.6.10.1 any selection of exporters, producers, importers or types of products made under this paragraph shall preferably be chosen in consultation with and with the consent of the exporters, producers or importers concerned.6.10.2 in cases where the authorities have limited their examination, as provided for in this paragraph, they shall nevertheless determine an individual margin of dumping for any exporter or producer not initially selected who submits the necessary information in time for that information to be considered during the course of the investigation, except where the number of exporters or producers is so large that individual examinations would be unduly burdensome to the authorities and prevent the timely completion of the investigation. voluntary responses shall not be discouraged.6.11 for the purposes of this agreement, "interested parties" shall include:(i) an exporter or foreign producer or the importer of a product subject to investigation, or a trade or business association a majority of the members of which are producers, exporters or importers of such product;(ii) the government of the exporting member; and(iii) a producer of the like product in the importing member or a trade and business association a majority of the members of which produce the like product in the territory of the importing member.this list shall not preclude members from allowing domestic or foreign parties other than those mentioned above to be included as interested parties.6.12 the authorities shall provide opportunities for industrial users of the product under investigation, and for representative consumer organizations in cases where the product is commonly sold at the retail level, to provide information which is relevant to the investigation regarding dumping, injury and causality.6.13 the authorities shall take due account of any difficulties experienced by interested parties, in particular small companies, in supplying information requested, and shall provide any assistance practicable.6.14 the procedures set out above are not intended to prevent the authorities of a member from proceeding expeditiously with regard to initiating an investigation, reaching preliminary or final determinations, whether affirmative or negative, or from applying provisional or final measures, in accordance with relevant provisions of this agreement ARTICLE 7provisional measures7.1 provisional measures may be applied only if:(i) an investigation has been initiated in accordance with the provisions of article 5, a public notice has been given to that effect and interested parties have been given adequate opportunities to submit information and make comments;(ii) a preliminary affirmative determination has been made of dumping and consequent injury to a domestic industry; and(iii) the authorities concerned judge such measures necessary to prevent injury being caused during the investigation.7.2 provisional measures may take the form of a provisional duty or, preferably, a security - by cash deposit or bond - equal to the amount of the anti-dumping duty provisionally estimated, being not greater than the provisionally estimated margin of dumping. withholding of appraisement is an appropriate provisional measure, provided that the normal duty and the estimated amount of the anti-dumping duty be indicated and as long as the withholding of appraisement is subject to the same conditions as other provisional measures.7.3 provisional measures shall not be applied sooner than 60 days from the date of initiation of the investigation.7.4 the application of provisional measures shall be limited to as short a period as possible, not exceeding four months or, on decision of the authorities concerned, upon request by exporters representing a significant percentage of the trade involved, to a period not exceeding six months. when authorities, in the course of an investigation, examine whether a duty lower than the margin of dumping would be sufficient to remove injury, these periods may be six and nine months, respectively.7.5 the relevant provisions of article 9 shall be followed in the application of provisional measures ARTICLE 8price undertakings8.1 proceedings may[47] be suspended or terminated without the imposition of provisional measures or anti-dumping duties upon receipt of satisfactory voluntary undertakings from any exporter to revise its prices or to cease exports to the area in question at dumped prices so that the authorities are satisfied that the injurious effect of the dumping is eliminated. price increases under such undertakings shall not be higher than necessary to eliminate the margin of dumping. it is desirable that the price increases be less than the margin of dumping if such increases would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.8.2 price undertakings shall not be sought or accepted from exporters unless the authorities of the importing member have made a preliminary affirmative determination of dumping and injury caused by such dumping.8.3 undertakings offered need not be accepted if the authorities consider their acceptance impractical, for example, if the number of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for other reasons, including reasons of general policy. should the case arise and where practicable, the authorities shall provide to the exporter the reasons which have led them to consider acceptance of an undertaking as inappropriate, and shall, to the extent possible, give the exporter an opportunity to make comments thereon.8.4 if an undertaking is accepted, the investigation of dumping and injury shall nevertheless be completed if the exporter so desires or the authorities so decide. in such a case, if a negative determination of dumping or injury is made, the undertaking shall automatically lapse, except in cases where such a determination is due in large part to the existence of a price undertaking. in such cases, the authorities may require that an undertaking be maintained for a reasonable period consistent with the provisions of this agreement. in the event that an affirmative determination of dumping and injury is made, the undertaking shall continue consistent with its terms and the provisions of this agreement.8.5 price undertakings may be suggested by the authorities of the importing member, but no exporter shall be forced to enter into such undertakings. the fact that exporters do not offer such undertakings, or do not accept an invitation to do so, shall in no way prejudice the consideration of the case. however, the authorities are free to determine that a threat of injury is more likely to be realized if the dumped imports continue.8.6 authorities of an importing member may require any exporter from whom an undertaking has been accepted to provide periodically information relevant to the fulfilment of such an undertaking and to permit verification of pertinent data. in case of violation of an undertaking, the authorities of the importing member may take, under this agreement in conformity with its provisions, expeditious actions which may constitute immediate application of provisional measures using the best information available. in such cases, definitive duties may be levied in accordance with this agreement on products entered for consumption not more than 90 days before the application of such provisional measures, except that any such retroactive assessment shall not apply to imports entered before the violation of the undertaking ARTICLE 9imposition and collection of anti-dumping duties9.1 the decision whether or not to impose an anti-dumping duty in cases where all requirements for the imposition have been fulfilled, and the decision whether the amount of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed shall be the full margin of dumping or less, are decisions to be made by the authorities of the importing member. it is desirable that the imposition be permissive in the territory of all members, and that the duty be less than the margin if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.9.2 when an anti-dumping duty is imposed in respect of any product, such anti-dumping duty shall be collected in the appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis on imports of such product from all sources found to be dumped and causing injury, except as to imports from those sources from which price undertakings under the terms of this agreement have been accepted. the authorities shall name the supplier or suppliers of the product concerned. if, however, several suppliers from the same country are involved, and it is impracticable to name all these suppliers, the authorities may name the supplying country concerned. if several suppliers from more than one country are involved, the authorities may name either all the suppliers involved, or, if this is impracticable, all the supplying countries involved.9.3 the amount of the anti-dumping duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping as established under article 2.9.3.1 when the amount of the anti-dumping duty is assessed on a retrospective basis, the determination of the final liability for payment of anti-dumping duties shall take place as soon as possible, normally within 12 months, and in no case more than 18 months, after the date on which a request for a final assessment of the amount of the anti-dumping duty has been made.[48] any refund shall be made promptly and normally in not more than 90 days following the determination of final liability made pursuant to this sub-paragraph. in any case, where a refund is not made within 90 days, the authorities shall provide an explanation if so requested.9.3.2 when the amount of the anti-dumping duty is assessed on a prospective basis, provision shall be made for a prompt refund, upon request, of any duty paid in excess of the margin of dumping. a refund of any such duty paid in excess of the actual margin of dumping shall normally take place within 12 months, and in no case more than 18 months, after the date on which a request for a refund, duly supported by evidence, has been made by an importer of the product subject to the anti-dumping duty. the refund authorized should normally be made within 90 days of the above-noted decision.9.3.3 in determining whether and to what extent a reimbursement should be made when the export price is constructed in accordance with paragraph 3 of article 2, authorities should take account of any change in normal value, any change in costs incurred between importation and resale, and any movement in the resale price which is duly reflected in subsequent selling prices, and should calculate the export price with no deduction for the amount of anti-dumping duties paid when conclusive evidence of the above is provided.9.4 when the authorities have limited their examination in accordance with the second sentence of paragraph 10 of article 6, any anti-dumping duty applied to imports from exporters or producers not included in the examination shall not exceed:(i) the weighted average margin of dumping established with respect to the selected exporters or producers or,(ii) where the liability for payment of anti-dumping duties is calculated on the basis of a prospective normal value, the difference between the weighted average normal value of the selected exporters or producers and the export prices of exporters or producers not individually examined,provided that the authorities shall disregard for the purpose of this paragraph any zero and de minimis margins and margins established under the circumstances referred to in paragraph 8 of article 6. the authorities shall apply individual duties or normal values to imports from any exporter or producer not included in the examination who has provided the necessary information during the course of the investigation, as provided for in subparagraph 10.2 of article 6.9.5 if a product is subject to anti-dumping duties in an importing member, the authorities shall promptly carry out a review for the purpose of determining individual margins of dumping for any exporters or producers in the exporting country in question who have not exported the product to the importing member during the period of investigation, provided that these exporters or producers can show that they are not related to any of the exporters or producers in the exporting country who are subject to the anti-dumping duties on the product. such a review shall be initiated and carried out on an accelerated basis, compared to normal duty assessment and review proceedings in the importing member. no anti-dumping duties shall be levied on imports from such exporters or producers while the review is being carried out. the authorities may, however, withhold appraisement and/or request guarantees to ensure that, should such a review result in a determination of dumping in respect of such producers or exporters, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of the review ARTICLE 10retroactivity10.1 provisional measures and anti-dumping duties shall only be applied to products which enter for consumption after the time when the decision taken under paragraph 1 of article 7 and paragraph 1 of article 9, respectively, enters into force, subject to the exceptions set out in this article.10.2 where a final determination of injury (but not of a threat thereof or of a material retardation of the establishment of an industry) is made or, in the case of a final determination of a threat of injury, where the effect of the dumped imports would, in the absence of the provisional measures, have led to a determination of injury, anti-dumping duties may be levied retroactively for the period for which provisional measures, if any, have been applied.10.3 if the definitive anti-dumping duty is higher than the provisional duty paid or payable, or the amount estimated for the purpose of the security, the difference shall not be collected. if the definitive duty is lower than the provisional duty paid or payable, or the amount estimated for the purpose of the security, the difference shall be reimbursed or the duty recalculated, as the case may be.10.4 except as provided in paragraph 2, where a determination of threat of injury or material retardation is made (but no injury has yet occurred) a definitive anti-dumping duty may be imposed only from the date of the determination of threat of injury or material retardation, and any cash deposit made during the period of the application of provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds released in an expeditious manner.10.5 where a final determination is negative, any cash deposit made during the period of the application of provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds released in an expeditious manner.10.6 a definitive anti-dumping duty may be levied on products which were entered for consumption not more than 90 days prior to the date of application of provisional measures, when the authorities determine for the dumped product in question that:(i) there is a history of dumping which caused injury or that the importer was, or should have been, aware that the exporter practises dumping and that such dumping would cause injury, and(ii) the injury is caused by massive dumped imports of a product in a relatively short time which in light of the timing and the volume of the dumped imports and other circumstances (such as a rapid build-up of inventories of the imported product) is likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of the definitive anti-dumping duty to be applied, provided that the importers concerned have been given an opportunity to comment.10.7 the authorities may, after initiating an investigation, take such measures as the withholding of appraisement or assessment as may be necessary to collect anti-dumping duties retroactively, as provided for in paragraph 6, once they have sufficient evidence that the conditions set forth in that paragraph are satisfied.10.8 no duties shall be levied retroactively pursuant to paragraph 6 on products entered for consumption prior to the date of initiation of the investigation ARTICLE 11duration and review of anti-dumping duties and price undertakings11.1 an anti-dumping duty shall remain in force only as long as and to the extent necessary to counteract dumping which is causing injury.11.2 the authorities shall review the need for the continued imposition of the duty, where warranted, on their own initiative or, provided that a reasonable period of time has elapsed since the imposition of the definitive anti-dumping duty, upon request by any interested party which submits positive information substantiating the need for a review.[49] interested parties shall have the right to request the authorities to examine whether the continued imposition of the duty is necessary to offset dumping, whether the injury would be likely to continue or recur if the duty were removed or varied, or both. if, as a result of the review under this paragraph, the authorities determine that the anti-dumping duty is no longer warranted, it shall be terminated immediately.11.3 notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, any definitive anti-dumping duty shall be terminated on a date not later than five years from its imposition (or from the date of the most recent review under paragraph 2 if that review has covered both dumping and injury, or under this paragraph), unless the authorities determine, in a review initiated before that date on their own initiative or upon a duly substantiated request made by or on behalf of the domestic industry within a reasonable period of time prior to that date, that the expiry of the duty would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury.[50] the duty may remain in force pending the outcome of such a review.11.4 the provisions of article 6 regarding evidence and procedure shall apply to any review carried out under this article. any such review shall be carried out expeditiously and shall normally be concluded within 12 months of the date of initiation of the review.11.5 the provisions of this article shall apply mutatis mutandis to price undertakings accepted under article 8 ARTICLE 12public notice and explanation of determinations12.1 when the authorities are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation pursuant to article 5, the member or members the products of which are subject to such investigation and other interested parties known to the investigating authorities to have an interest therein shall be notified and a public notice shall be given.12.1.1 a public notice of the initiation of an investigation shall contain, or otherwise make available through a separate report[51], adequate information on the following:(i) the name of the exporting country or countries and the product involved;(ii) the date of initiation of the investigation;(iii) the basis on which dumping is alleged in the application;(iv) a summary of the factors on which the allegation of injury is based;(v) the address to which representations by interested parties should be directed;(vi) the time-limits allowed to interested parties for making their views known.12.2 public notice shall be given of any preliminary or final determination, whether affirmative or negative, of any decision to accept an undertaking pursuant to article 8, of the termination of such an undertaking, and of the termination of a definitive anti-dumping duty. each such notice shall set forth, or otherwise make available through a separate report, in sufficient detail the findings and conclusions reached on all issues of fact and law considered material by the investigating authorities. all such notices and reports shall be forwarded to the member or members the products of which are subject to such determination or undertaking and to other interested parties known to have an interest therein.12.2.1 a public notice of the imposition of provisional measures shall set forth, or otherwise make available through a separate report, sufficiently detailed explanations for the preliminary determinations on dumping and injury and shall refer to the matters of fact and law which have led to arguments being accepted or rejected. such a notice or report shall, due regard being paid to the requirement for the protection of confidential information, contain in particular:(i) the names of the suppliers, or when this is impracticable, the supplying countries involved;(ii) a description of the product which is sufficient for customs purposes;(iii) the margins of dumping established and a full explanation of the reasons for the methodology used in the establishment and comparison of the export price and the normal value under article 2;(iv) considerations relevant to the injury determination as set out in article 3;(v) the main reasons leading to the determination.12.2.2 a public notice of conclusion or suspension of an investigation in the case of an affirmative determination providing for the imposition of a definitive duty or the acceptance of a price undertaking shall contain, or otherwise make available through a separate report, all relevant information on the matters of fact and law and reasons which have led to the imposition of final measures or the acceptance of a price undertaking, due regard being paid to the requirement for the protection of confidential information. in particular, the notice or report shall contain the information described in subparagraph 2.1, as well as the reasons for the acceptance or rejection of relevant arguments or claims made by the exporters and importers, and the basis for any decision made under subparagraph 10.2 of article 6.12.2.3 a public notice of the termination or suspension of an investigation following the acceptance of an undertaking pursuant to article 8 shall include, or otherwise make available through a separate report, the non-confidential part of this undertaking.12.3 the provisions of this article shall apply mutatis mutandis to the initiation and completion of reviews pursuant to article 11 and to decisions under article 10 to apply duties retroactively ARTICLE 13judicial revieweach member whose national legislation contains provisions on anti-dumping measures shall maintain judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures for the purpose, inter alia, of the prompt review of administrative actions relating to final determinations and reviews of determinations within the meaning of article 11. such tribunals or procedures shall be independent of the authorities responsible for the determination or review in question ARTICLE 14anti-dumping action on behalf of a third country14.1 an application for anti-dumping action on behalf of a third country shall be made by the authorities of the third country requesting action.14.2 such an application shall be supported by price information to show that the imports are being dumped and by detailed information to show that the alleged dumping is causing injury to the domestic industry concerned in the third country. the government of the third country shall afford all assistance to the authorities of the importing country to obtain any further information which the latter may require.14.3 in considering such an application, the authorities of the importing country shall consider the effects of the alleged dumping on the industry concerned as a whole in the third country; that is to say, the injury shall not be assessed in relation only to the effect of the alleged dumping on the industry's exports to the importing country or even on the industry's total exports.14.4 the decision whether or not to proceed with a case shall rest with the importing country. if the importing country decides that it is prepared to take action, the initiation of the approach to the council for trade in goods seeking its approval for such action shall rest with the importing country ARTICLE 15developing country membersit is recognized that special regard must be given by developed country members to the special situation of developing country members when considering the application of anti-dumping measures under this agreement. possibilities of constructive remedies provided for by this agreement shall be explored before applying anti-dumping duties where they would affect the essential interests of developing country members.part ii ARTICLE 16committee on anti-dumping practices16.1 there is hereby established a committee on anti-dumping practices (referred to in this agreement as the "committee") composed of representatives from each of the members. the committee shall elect its own chairman and shall meet not less than twice a year and otherwise as envisaged by relevant provisions of this agreement at the request of any member. the committee shall carry out responsibilities as assigned to it under this agreement or by the members and it shall afford members the opportunity of consulting on any matters relating to the operation of the agreement or the furtherance of its objectives. the wto secretariat shall act as the secretariat to the committee.16.2 the committee may set up subsidiary bodies as appropriate.16.3 in carrying out their functions, the committee and any subsidiary bodies may consult with and seek information from any source they deem appropriate. however, before the committee or a subsidiary body seeks such information from a source within the jurisdiction of a member, it shall inform the member involved. it shall obtain the consent of the member and any firm to be consulted.16.4 members shall report without delay to the committee all preliminary or final anti-dumping actions taken. such reports shall be available in the secretariat for inspection by other members. members shall also submit, on a semi-annual basis, reports of any anti-dumping actions taken within the preceding six months. the semi-annual reports shall be submitted on an agreed standard form.16.5 each member shall notify the committee (a) which of its authorities are competent to initiate and conduct investigations referred to in article 5 and (b) its domestic procedures governing the initiation and conduct of such investigations ARTICLE 17consultation and dispute settlement17.1 except as otherwise provided herein, the dispute settlement understanding is applicable to consultations and the settlement of disputes under this agreement.17.2 each member shall afford sympathetic consideration to, and shall afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding, representations made by another member with respect to any matter affecting the operation of this agreement.17.3 if any member considers that any benefit accruing to it, directly or indirectly, under this agreement is being nullified or impaired, or that the achievement of any objective is being impeded, by another member or members, it may, with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter, request in writing consultations with the member or members in question. each member shall afford sympathetic consideration to any request from another member for consultation.17.4 if the member that requested consultations considers that the consultations pursuant to paragraph 3 have failed to achieve a mutually agreed solution, and if final action has been taken by the administering authorities of the importing member to levy definitive anti-dumping duties or to accept price undertakings, it may refer the matter to the dispute settlement body ("dsb"). when a provisional measure has a significant impact and the member that requested consultations considers that the measure was taken contrary to the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 7, that member may also refer such matter to the dsb.17.5 the dsb shall, at the request of the complaining party, establish a panel to examine the matter based upon:(i) a written statement of the member making the request indicating how a benefit accruing to it, directly or indirectly, under this agreement has been nullified or impaired, or that the achieving of the objectives of the agreement is being impeded, and(ii) the facts made available in conformity with appropriate domestic procedures to the authorities of the importing member.17.6 in examining the matter referred to in paragraph 5:(i) in its assessment of the facts of the matter, the panel shall determine whether the authorities' establishment of the facts was proper and whether their evaluation of those facts was unbiased and objective. if the establishment of the facts was proper and the evaluation was unbiased and objective, even though the panel might have reached a different conclusion, the evaluation shall not be overturned;(ii) the panel shall interpret the relevant provisions of the agreement in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law. where the panel finds that a relevant provision of the agreement admits of more than one permissible interpretation, the panel shall find the authorities' measure to be in conformity with the agreement if it rests upon one of those permissible interpretations.17.7 confidential information provided to the panel shall not be disclosed without formal authorization from the person, body or authority providing such information. where such information is requested from the panel but release of such information by the panel is not authorized, a non-confidential summary of the information, authorized by the person, body or authority providing the information, shall be provided.part iii ARTICLE 18final provisions18.1 no specific action against dumping of exports from another member can be taken except in accordance with the provisions of gatt 1994, as interpreted by this agreement.[52]18.2 reservations may not be entered in respect of any of the provisions of this agreement without the consent of the other members.18.3 subject to subparagraphs 3.1 and 3.2, the provisions of this agreement shall apply to investigations, and reviews of existing measures, initiated pursuant to applications which have been made on or after the date of entry into force for a member of the wto agreement.18.3.1 with respect to the calculation of margins of dumping in refund procedures under paragraph 3 of article 9, the rules used in the most recent determination or review of dumping shall apply.18.3.2 for the purposes of paragraph 3 of article 11, existing anti-dumping measures shall be deemed to be imposed on a date not later than the date of entry into force for a member of the wto agreement, except in cases in which the domestic legislation of a member in force on that date already included a clause of the type provided for in that paragraph.18.4 each member shall take all necessary steps, of a general or particular character, to ensure, not later than the date of entry into force of the wto agreement for it, the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of this agreement as they may apply for the member in question.18.5 each member shall inform the committee of any changes in its laws and regulations relevant to this agreement and in the administration of such laws and regulations.18.6 the committee shall review annually the implementation and operation of this agreement taking into account the objectives thereof. the committee shall inform annually the council for trade in goods of developments during the period covered by such reviews.18.7 the annexes to this agreement constitute an integral part thereof ANNEX iprocedures for on-the-spot investigationspursuant to paragraph 7 of article 61. upon initiation of an investigation, the authorities of the exporting member and the firms known to be concerned should be informed of the intention to carry out on-the-spot investigations.2. if in exceptional circumstances it is intended to include non-governmental experts in the investigating team, the firms and the authorities of the exporting member should be so informed. such non-governmental experts should be subject to effective sanctions for breach of confidentiality requirements.3. it should be standard practice to obtain explicit agreement of the firms concerned in the exporting member before the visit is finally scheduled.4. as soon as the agreement of the firms concerned has been obtained, the investigating authorities should notify the authorities of the exporting member of the names and addresses of the firms to be visited and the dates agreed.5. sufficient advance notice should be given to the firms in question before the visit is made.6. visits to explain the questionnaire should only be made at the request of an exporting firm. such a visit may only be made if (a) the authorities of the importing member notify the representatives of the member in question and (b) the latter do not object to the visit.7. as the main purpose of the on-the-spot investigation is to verify information provided or to obtain further details, it should be carried out after the response to the questionnaire has been received unless the firm agrees to the contrary and the government of the exporting member is informed by the investigating authorities of the anticipated visit and does not object to it; further, it should be standard practice prior to the visit to advise the firms concerned of the general nature of the information to be verified and of any further information which needs to be provided, though this should not preclude requests to be made on the spot for further details to be provided in the light of information obtained.8. enquiries or questions put by the authorities or firms of the exporting members and essential to a successful on-the-spot investigation should, whenever possible, be answered before the visit is made ANNEX iibest information available in termsof paragraph 8 of article 61. as soon as possible after the initiation of the investigation, the investigating authorities should specify in detail the information required from any interested party, and the manner in which that information should be structured by the interested party in its response. the authorities should also ensure that the party is aware that if information is not supplied within a reasonable time, the authorities will be free to make determinations on the basis of the facts available, including those contained in the application for the initiation of the investigation by the domestic industry.2. the authorities may also request that an interested party provide its response in a particular medium (e.g. computer tape) or computer language. where such a request is made, the authorities should consider the reasonable ability of the interested party to respond in the preferred medium or computer language, and should not request the party to use for its response a computer system other than that used by the party. the authority should not maintain a request for a computerized response if the interested party does not maintain computerized accounts and if presenting the response as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden on the interested party, e.g. it would entail unreasonable additional cost and trouble. the authorities should not maintain a request for a response in a particular medium or computer language if the interested party does not maintain its computerized accounts in such medium or computer language and if presenting the response as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden on the interested party, e.g. it would entail unreasonable additional cost and trouble.3. all information which is verifiable, which is appropriately submitted so that it can be used in the investigation without undue difficulties, which is supplied in a timely fashion, and, where applicable, which is supplied in a medium or computer language requested by the authorities, should be taken into account when determinations are made. if a party does not respond in the preferred medium or computer language but the authorities find that the circumstances set out in paragraph 2 have been satisfied, the failure to respond in the preferred medium or computer language should not be considered to significantly impede the investigation.4. where the authorities do not have the ability to process information if provided in a particular medium (e.g. computer tape), the information should be supplied in the form of written material or any other form acceptable to the authorities.5. even though the information provided may not be ideal in all respects, this should not justify the authorities from disregarding it, provided the interested party has acted to the best of its ability.6. if evidence or information is not accepted, the supplying party should be informed forthwith of the reasons therefor, and should have an opportunity to provide further explanations within a reasonable period, due account being taken of the time-limits of the investigation. if the explanations are considered by the authorities as not being satisfactory, the reasons for the rejection of such evidence or information should be given in any published determinations.7. if the authorities have to base their findings, including those with respect to normal value, on information from a secondary source, including the information supplied in the application for the initiation of the investigation, they should do so with special circumspection. in such cases, the authorities should, where practicable, check the information from other independent sources at their disposal, such as published price lists, official import statistics and customs returns, and from the information obtained from other interested parties during the investigation. it is clear, however, that if an interested party does not cooperate and thus relevant information is being withheld from the authorities, this situation could lead to a result which is less favourable to the party than if the party did cooperate.agreement on implementation of article vii ofthe general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994general introductory commentary1. the primary basis for customs value under this agreement is "transaction value" as defined in article 1 ARTICLE 1 is to be read together with article 8 which provides, inter alia, for adjustments to the price actually paid or payable in cases where certain specific elements which are considered to form a part of the value for customs purposes are incurred by the buyer but are not included in the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods ARTICLE 8 also provides for the inclusion in the transaction value of certain considerations which may pass from the buyer to the seller in the form of specified goods or services rather than in the form of money. articles 2 through 7 provide methods of determining the customs value whenever it cannot be determined under the provisions of article 1.2. where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of article 1 there should normally be a process of consultation between the customs administration and importer with a view to arriving at a basis of value under the provisions of article 2 or 3. it may occur, for example, that the importer has information about the customs value of identical or similar imported goods which is not immediately available to the customs administration in the port of importation. on the other hand, the customs administration may have information about the customs value of identical or similar imported goods which is not readily available to the importer. a process of consultation between the two parties will enable information to be exchanged, subject to the requirements of commercial confidentiality, with a view to determining a proper basis of value for customs purposes.3. articles 5 and 6 provide two bases for determining the customs value where it cannot be determined on the basis of the transaction value of the imported goods or of identical or similar imported goods. under paragraph 1 of article 5 the customs value is determined on the basis of the price at which the goods are sold in the condition as imported to an unrelated buyer in the country of importation. the importer also has the right to have goods which are further processed after importation valued under the provisions of article 5 if the importer so requests. under article 6 the customs value is determined on the basis of the computed value. both these methods present certain difficulties and because of this the importer is given the right, under the provisions of article 4, to choose the order of application of the two methods.4 ARTICLE 7 sets out how to determine the customs value in cases where it cannot be determined under the provisions of any of the preceding articles.members,having regard to the multilateral trade negotiations;desiring to further the objectives of gatt 1994 and to secure additional benefits for the international trade of developing countries;recognizing the importance of the provisions of article vii of gatt 1994 and desiring to elaborate rules for their application in order to provide greater uniformity and certainty in their implementation;recognizing the need for a fair, uniform and neutral system for the valuation of goods for customs purposes that precludes the use of arbitrary or fictitious customs values;recognizing that the basis for valuation of goods for customs purposes should, to the greatest extent possible, be the transaction value of the goods being valued;recognizing that customs value should be based on simple and equitable criteria consistent with commercial practices and that valuation procedures should be of general application without distinction between sources of supply;recognizing that valuation procedures should not be used to combat dumping;hereby agree as follows:part irules on customs valuation ARTICLE 11. the customs value of imported goods shall be the transaction value, that is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation adjusted in accordance with the provisions of article 8, provided:(a) that there are no restrictions as to the disposition or use of the goods by the buyer other than restrictions which:(i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the country of importation;(ii) limit the geographical area in which the goods may be resold; or(iii) do not substantially affect the value of the goods;(b) that the sale or price is not subject to some condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued;(c) that no part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the goods by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made in accordance with the provisions of article 8; and(d) that the buyer and seller are not related, or where the buyer and seller are related, that the transaction value is acceptable for customs purposes under the provisions of paragraph 2.2. (a) in determining whether the transaction value is acceptable for the purposes of paragraph 1, the fact that the buyer and the seller are related within the meaning of article 15 shall not in itself be grounds for regarding the transaction value as unacceptable. in such case the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship did not influence the price. if, in the light of information provided by the importer or otherwise, the customs administration has grounds for considering that the relationship influenced the price, it shall communicate its grounds to the importer and the importer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond. if the importer so requests, the communication of the grounds shall be in writing.(b) in a sale between related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted and the goods valued in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 whenever the importer demonstrates that such value closely approximates to one of the following occurring at or about the same time:(i) the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical or similar goods for export to the same country of importation;(ii) the customs value of identical or similar goods as determined under the provisions of article 5;(iii) the customs value of identical or similar goods as determined under the provisions of article 6;in applying the foregoing tests, due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the elements enumerated in article 8 and costs incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are related.(c) the tests set forth in paragraph 2(b) are to be used at the initiative of the importer and only for comparison purposes. substitute values may not be established under the provisions of paragraph 2(b) ARTICLE 21. (a) if the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of article 1, the customs value shall be the transaction value of identical goods sold for export to the same country of importation and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued.(b) in applying this article, the transaction value of identical goods in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity as the goods being valued shall be used to determine the customs value. where no such sale is found, the transaction value of identical goods sold at a different commercial level and/or in different quantities, adjusted to take account of differences attributable to commercial level and/or to quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustment, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.2. where the costs and charges referred to in paragraph 2 of article 8 are included in the transaction value, an adjustment shall be made to take account of significant differences in such costs and charges between the imported goods and the identical goods in question arising from differences in distances and modes of transport.3. if, in applying this article, more than one transaction value of identical goods is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the customs value of the imported goods ARTICLE 31. (a) if the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of articles 1 and 2, the customs value shall be the transaction value of similar goods sold for export to the same country of importation and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued.(b) in applying this article, the transaction value of similar goods in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity as the goods being valued shall be used to determine the customs value. where no such sale is found, the transaction value of similar goods sold at a different commercial level and/or in different quantities, adjusted to take account of differences attributable to commercial level and/or to quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustment, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value.2. where the costs and charges referred to in paragraph 2 of article 8 are included in the transaction value, an adjustment shall be made to take account of significant differences in such costs and charges between the imported goods and the similar goods in question arising from differences in distances and modes of transport.3. if, in applying this article, more than one transaction value of similar goods is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the customs value of the imported goods ARTICLE 4if the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of articles 1, 2 and 3, the customs value shall be determined under the provisions of article 5 or, when the customs value cannot be determined under that article, under the provisions of article 6 except that, at the request of the importer, the order of application of articles 5 and 6 shall be reversed ARTICLE 51. (a) if the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in the country of importation in the condition as imported, the customs value of the imported goods under the provisions of this article shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are so sold in the greatest aggregate quantity, at or about the time of the importation of the goods being valued, to persons who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods, subject to deductions for the following:(i) either the commissions usually paid or agreed to be paid or the additions usually made for profit and general expenses in connection with sales in such country of imported goods of the same class or kind;(ii) the usual costs of transport and insurance and associated costs incurred within the country of importation;(iii) where appropriate, the costs and charges referred to in paragraph 2 of article 8; and(iv) the customs duties and other national taxes payable in the country of importation by reason of the importation or sale of the goods.(b) if neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold at or about the time of importation of the goods being valued, the customs value shall, subject otherwise to the provisions of paragraph 1(a), be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in the country of importation in the condition as imported at the earliest date after the importation of the goods being valued but before the expiration of 90 days after such importation.2. if neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold in the country of importation in the condition as imported, then, if the importer so requests, the customs value shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods, after further processing, are sold in the greatest aggregate quantity to persons in the country of importation who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods, due allowance being made for the value added by such processing and the deductions provided for in paragraph 1(a) ARTICLE 61. the customs value of imported goods under the provisions of this article shall be based on a computed value. computed value shall consist of the sum of:(a) the cost or value of materials and fabrication or other processing employed in producing the imported goods;(b) an amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the country of importation;(c) the cost or value of all other expenses necessary to reflect the valuation option chosen by the member under paragraph 2 of article 8.2. no member may require or compel any person not resident in its own territory to produce for examination, or to allow access to, any account or other record for the purposes of determining a computed value. however, information supplied by the producer of the goods for the purposes of determining the customs value under the provisions of this article may be verified in another country by the authorities of the country of importation with the agreement of the producer and provided they give sufficient advance notice to the government of the country in question and the latter does not object to the investigation ARTICLE 71. if the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under the provisions of articles 1 through 6, inclusive, the customs value shall be determined using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of this agreement and of article vii of gatt 1994 and on the basis of data available in the country of importation.2. no customs value shall be determined under the provisions of this article on the basis of:(a) the selling price in the country of importation of goods produced in such country;(b) a system which provides for the acceptance for customs purposes of the higher of two alternative values;(c) the price of goods on the domestic market of the country of exportation;(d) the cost of production other than computed values which have been determined for identical or similar goods in accordance with the provisions of article 6;(e) the price of the goods for export to a country other than the country of importation;(f) minimum customs values; or(g) arbitrary or fictitious values.3. if the importer so requests, the importer shall be informed in writing of the customs value determined under the provisions of this article and the method used to determine such value ARTICLE 81. in determining the customs value under the provisions of article 1, there shall be added to the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods:(a) the following, to the extent that they are incurred by the buyer but are not included in the price actually paid or payable for the goods:(i) commissions and brokerage, except buying commissions;(ii) the cost of containers which are treated as being one for customs purposes with the goods in question;(iii) the cost of packing whether for labour or materials;(b) the value, apportioned as appropriate, of the following goods and services where supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale for export of the imported goods, to the extent that such value has not been included in the price actually paid or payable:(i) materials, components, parts and similar items incorporated in the imported goods;(ii) tools, dies, moulds and similar items used in the production of the imported goods;(iii) materials consumed in the production of the imported goods;(iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches undertaken elsewhere than in the country of importation and necessary for the production of the imported goods;(c) royalties and licence fees related to the goods being valued that the buyer must pay, either directly or indirectly, as a condition of sale of the goods being valued, to the extent that such royalties and fees are not included in the price actually paid or payable;(d) the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the imported goods that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller.2. in framing its legislation, each member shall provide for the inclusion in or the exclusion from the customs value, in whole or in part, of the following:(a) the cost of transport of the imported goods to the port or place of importation;(b) loading, unloading and handling charges associated with the transport of the imported goods to the port or place of importation; and(c) the cost of insurance.3. additions to the price actually paid or payable shall be made under this article only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data.4. no additions shall be made to the price actually paid or payable in determining the customs value except as provided in this article ARTICLE 91. where the conversion of currency is necessary for the determination of the customs value, the rate of exchange to be used shall be that duly published by the competent authorities of the country of importation concerned and shall reflect as effectively as possible, in respect of the period covered by each such document of publication, the current value of such currency in commercial transactions in terms of the currency of the country of importation.2. the conversion rate to be used shall be that in effect at the time of exportation or the time of importation, as provided by each member ARTICLE 10all information which is by nature confidential or which is provided on a confidential basis for the purposes of customs valuation shall be treated as strictly confidential by the authorities concerned who shall not disclose it without the specific permission of the person or government providing such information, except to the extent that it may be required to be disclosed in the context of judicial proceedings ARTICLE 111. the legislation of each member shall provide in regard to a determination of customs value for the right of appeal, without penalty, by the importer or any other person liable for the payment of the duty.2. an initial right of appeal without penalty may be to an authority within the customs administration or to an independent body, but the legislation of each member shall provide for the right of appeal without penalty to a judicial authority.3. notice of the decision on appeal shall be given to the appellant and the reasons for such decision shall be provided in writing. the appellant shall also be informed of any rights of further appeal ARTICLE 12laws, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application giving effect to this agreement shall be published in conformity with article x of gatt 1994 by the country of importation concerned ARTICLE 13if, in the course of determining the customs value of imported goods, it becomes necessary to delay the final determination of such customs value, the importer of the goods shall nevertheless be able to withdraw them from customs if, where so required, the importer provides sufficient guarantee in the form of a surety, a deposit or some other appropriate instrument, covering the ultimate payment of customs duties for which the goods may be liable. the legislation of each member shall make provisions for such circumstances ARTICLE 14the notes at annex i to this agreement form an integral part of this agreement and the articles of this agreement are to be read and applied in conjunction with their respective notes. annexes ii and iii also form an integral part of this agreement ARTICLE 151. in this agreement:(a) "customs value of imported goods" means the value of goods for the purposes of levying ad valorem duties of customs on imported goods;(b) "country of importation" means country or customs territory of importation; and(c) "produced" includes grown, manufactured and mined.2. in this agreement:(a) "identical goods" means goods which are the same in all respects, including physical characteristics, quality and reputation. minor differences in appearance would not preclude goods otherwise conforming to the definition from being regarded as identical;(b) "similar goods" means goods which, although not alike in all respects, have like characteristics and like component materials which enable them to perform the same functions and to be commercially interchangeable. the quality of the goods, their reputation and the existence of a trademark are among the factors to be considered in determining whether goods are similar;(c) the terms "identical goods" and "similar goods" do not include, as the case may be, goods which incorporate or reflect engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches for which no adjustment has been made under paragraph 1(b)(iv) of article 8 because such elements were undertaken in the country of importation;(d) goods shall not be regarded as "identical goods" or "similar goods" unless they were produced in the same country as the goods being valued;(e) goods produced by a different person shall be taken into account only when there are no identical goods or similar goods, as the case may be, produced by the same person as the goods being valued.3. in this agreement "goods of the same class or kind" means goods which fall within a group or range of goods produced by a particular industry or industry sector, and includes identical or similar goods.4. for the purposes of this agreement, persons shall be deemed to be related only if:(a) they are officers or directors of one another's businesses;(b) they are legally recognized partners in business;(c) they are employer and employee;(d) any person directly or indirectly owns, controls or holds 5 per cent or more of the outstanding voting stock or shares of both of them;(e) one of them directly or indirectly controls the other;(f) both of them are directly or indirectly controlled by a third person;(g) together they directly or indirectly control a third person; or(h) they are members of the same family.5. persons who are associated in business with one another in that one is the sole agent, sole distributor or sole concessionaire, however described, of the other shall be deemed to be related for the purposes of this agreement if they fall within the criteria of paragraph 4 ARTICLE 16upon written request, the importer shall have the right to an explanation in writing from the customs administration of the country of importation as to how the customs value of the importer's goods was determined ARTICLE 17nothing in this agreement shall be construed as restricting or calling into question the rights of customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes.part iiadministration, consultations and dispute settlement ARTICLE 18institutions1. there is hereby established a committee on customs valuation (referred to in this agreement as "the committee") composed of representatives from each of the members. the committee shall elect its own chairman and shall normally meet once a year, or as is otherwise envisaged by the relevant provisions of this agreement, for the purpose of affording members the opportunity to consult on matters relating to the administration of the customs valuation system by any member as it might affect the operation of this agreement or the furtherance of its objectives and carrying out such other responsibilities as may be assigned to it by the members. the wto secretariat shall act as the secretariat to the committee.2. there shall be established a technical committee on customs valuation (referred to in this agreement as "the technical committee") under the auspices of the customs co-operation council (referred to in this agreement as "the ccc"), which shall carry out the responsibilities described in annex ii to this agreement and shall operate in accordance with the rules of procedure contained therein ARTICLE 19consultations and dispute settlement1. except as otherwise provided herein, the dispute settlement understanding is applicable to consultations and the settlement of disputes under this agreement.2. if any member considers that any benefit accruing to it, directly or indirectly, under this agreement is being nullified or impaired, or that the achievement of any objective of this agreement is being impeded, as a result of the actions of another member or of other members, it may, with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution of this matter, request consultations with the member or members in question. each member shall afford sympathetic consideration to any request from another member for consultations.3. the technical committee shall provide, upon request, advice and assistance to members engaged in consultations.4. at the request of a party to the dispute, or on its own initiative, a panel established to examine a dispute relating to the provisions of this agreement may request the technical committee to carry out an examination of any questions requiring technical consideration. the panel shall determine the terms of reference of the technical committee for the particular dispute and set a time period for receipt of the report of the technical committee. the panel shall take into consideration the report of the technical committee. in the event that the technical committee is unable to reach consensus on a matter referred to it pursuant to this paragraph, the panel should afford the parties to the dispute an opportunity to present their views on the matter to the panel.5. confidential information provided to the panel shall not be disclosed without formal authorization from the person, body or authority providing such information. where such information is requested from the panel but release of such information by the panel is not authorized, a non-confidential summary of this information, authorized by the person, body or authority providing the information, shall be provided.part iiispecial and differential treatment ARTICLE 201. developing country members not party to the agreement on implementation of article vii of the general agreement on tariffs and trade done on 12 april 1979[*] may delay application of the provisions of this agreement for a period not exceeding five years from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement for such members. developing country members who choose to delay application of this agreement shall notify the director-general of the wto accordingly.2. in addition to paragraph 1, developing country members not party to the agreement on implementation of article vii of the general agreement on tariffs and trade done on 12 april 1979 may delay application of paragraph 2(b)(iii)

developing country members that so request. on this basis developed country members shall draw up programmes of technical assistance which may include, inter alia, training of personnel, assistance in preparing implementation measures, access to sources of information regarding customs valuation methodology, and advice on the application of the provisions of this agreement.part ivfinal provisions ARTICLE 21reservationsreservations may not be entered in respect of any of the provisions of this agreement without the consent of the other members ARTICLE 22national legislation1. each member shall ensure, not later than the date of application of the provisions of this agreement for it, the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of this agreement.2. each member shall inform the committee of any changes in its laws and regulations relevant to this agreement and in the administration of such laws and regulations ARTICLE 23reviewthe committee shall review annually the implementation and operation of this agreement taking into account the objectives thereof. the committee shall annually inform the council for trade in goods of developments during the period covered by such reviews ARTICLE 24secretariatthis agreement shall be serviced by the wto secretariat except in regard to those responsibilities specifically assigned to the technical committee, which will be serviced by the ccc secretariat ANNEX iinterpretative notesgeneral notesequential application of valuation methods1. articles 1 through 7 define how the customs value of imported goods is to be determined under the provisions of this agreement. the methods of valuation are set out in a sequential order of application. the primary method for customs valuation is defined in article 1 and imported goods are to be valued in accordance with the provisions of this article whenever the conditions prescribed therein are fulfilled.2. where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of article 1, it is to be determined by proceeding sequentially through the succeeding articles to the first such article under which the customs value can be determined. except as provided in article 4, it is only when the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of a particular article that the provisions of the next article in the sequence can be used.3. if the importer does not request that the order of articles 5 and 6 be reversed, the normal order of the sequence is to be followed. if the importer does so request but it then proves impossible to determine the customs value under the provisions of article 6, the customs value is to be determined under the provisions of article 5, if it can be so determined.4. where the customs value cannot be determined under the provisions of articles 1 through 6 it is to be determined under the provisions of article 7.use of generally accepted accounting principles1. "generally accepted accounting principles" refers to the recognized consensus or substantial authoritative support within a country at a particular time as to which economic resources and obligations should be recorded as assets and liabilities, which changes in assets and liabilities should be recorded, how the assets and liabilities and changes in them should be measured, what information should be disclosed and how it should be disclosed, and which financial statements should be prepared. these standards may be broad guidelines of general application as well as detailed practices and procedures.2. for the purposes of this agreement, the customs administration of each member shall utilize information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the country which is appropriate for the article in question. for example, the determination of usual profit and general expenses under the provisions of article 5 would be carried out utilizing information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country of importation. on the other hand, the determination of usual profit and general expenses under the provisions of article 6 would be carried out utilizing information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles of the country of production. as a further example, the determination of an element provided for in paragraph 1(b)(ii) of article 8 undertaken in the country of importation would be carried out utilizing information in a manner consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles of that country.note to article 1price actually paid or payable1. the price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the seller for the imported goods. the payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money. payment may be made by way of letters of credit or negotiable instruments. payment may be made directly or indirectly. an example of an indirect payment would be the settlement by the buyer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller.2. activities undertaken by the buyer on the buyer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in article 8, are not considered to be an indirect payment to the seller, even though they might be regarded as of benefit to the seller. the costs of such activities shall not, therefore, be added to the price actually paid or payable in determining the customs value.3. the customs value shall not include the following charges or costs, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods:(a) charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance, undertaken after importation on imported goods such as industrial plant, machinery or equipment;(b) the cost of transport after importation;(c) duties and taxes of the country of importation.4. the price actually paid or payable refers to the price for the imported goods. thus the flow of dividends or other payments from the buyer to the seller that do not relate to the imported goods are not part of the customs value.paragraph 1(a)(iii)among restrictions which would not render a price actually paid or payable unacceptable are restrictions which do not substantially affect the value of the goods. an example of such restrictions would be the case where a seller requires a buyer of automobiles not to sell or exhibit them prior to a fixed date which represents the beginning of a model year.paragraph 1(b)1. if the sale or price is subject to some condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued, the transaction value shall not be acceptable for customs purposes. some examples of this include:(a) the seller establishes the price of the imported goods on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities;(b) the price of the imported goods is dependent upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the imported goods sells other goods to the seller of the imported goods;(c) the price is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the imported goods, such as where the imported goods are semi-finished goods which have been provided by the seller on condition that the seller will receive a specified quantity of the finished goods.2. however, conditions or considerations relating to the production or marketing of the imported goods shall not result in rejection of the transaction value. for example, the fact that the buyer furnishes the seller with engineering and plans undertaken in the country of importation shall not result in rejection of the transaction value for the purposes of article 1. likewise, if the buyer undertakes on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller, activities relating to the marketing of the imported goods, the value of these activities is not part of the customs value nor shall such activities result in rejection of the transaction value.paragraph 21. paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) provide different means of establishing the acceptability of a transaction value.2. paragraph 2(a) provides that where the buyer and the seller are related, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the customs value provided that the relationship did not influence the price. it is not intended that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the buyer and the seller are related. such examination will only be required where there are doubts about the acceptability of the price. where the customs administration have no doubts about the acceptability of the price, it should be accepted without requesting further information from the importer. for example, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship, or it may already have detailed information concerning the buyer and the seller, and may already be satisfied from such examination or information that the relationship did not influence the price.3. where the customs administration is unable to accept the transaction value without further inquiry, it should give the importer an opportunity to supply such further detailed information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. in this context, the customs administration should be prepared to examine relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way in which the buyer and seller organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price in question was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship influenced the price. where it can be shown that the buyer and seller, although related under the provisions of article 15, buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced by the relationship. as an example of this, if the price had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question or with the way the seller settles prices for sales to buyers who are not related to the seller, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced by the relationship. as a further example, where it is shown that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which is representative of the firm's overall profit realized over a representative period of time (e.g. on an annual basis) in sales of goods of the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced.4. paragraph 2(b) provides an opportunity for the importer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates to a "test" value previously accepted by the customs administration and is therefore acceptable under the provisions of article 1. where a test under paragraph 2(b) is met, it is not necessary to examine the question of influence under paragraph 2(a). if the customs administration has already sufficient information to be satisfied, without further detailed inquiries, that one of the tests provided in paragraph 2(b) has been met, there is no reason for it to require the importer to demonstrate that the test can be met. in paragraph 2(b) the term "unrelated buyers" means buyers who are not related to the seller in any particular case.paragraph 2(b)a number of factors must be taken into consideration in determining whether one value "closely approximates" to another value. these factors include the nature of the imported goods, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the goods are imported, and, whether the difference in values is commercially significant. since these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply a uniform standard such as a fixed percentage, in each case. for example, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of goods could be unacceptable while a large difference in a case involving another type of goods might be acceptable in determining whether the transaction value closely approximates to the "test" values set forth in paragraph 2(b) of article 1.note to article 21. in applying article 2, the customs administration shall, wherever possible, use a sale of identical goods at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantities as the goods being valued. where no such sale is found, a sale of identical goods that takes place under any one of the following three conditions may be used:(a) a sale at the same commercial level but in different quantities;(b) a sale at a different commercial level but in substantially the same quantities; or(c) a sale at a different commercial level and in different quantities.2. having found a sale under any one of these three conditions adjustments will then be made, as the case may be, for:(a) quantity factors only;(b) commercial level factors only; or(c) both commercial level and quantity factors.3. the expression "and/or" allows the flexibility to use the sales and make the necessary adjustments in any one of the three conditions described above.4. for the purposes of article 2, the transaction value of identical imported goods means a customs value, adjusted as provided for in paragraphs 1(b) and 2, which has already been accepted under article 1.5. a condition for adjustment because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment, whether it leads to an increase or a decrease in the value, be made only on the basis of demonstrated evidence that clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustments, e.g. valid price lists containing prices referring to different levels or different quantities. as an example of this, if the imported goods being valued consist of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical imported goods for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's price list and using that price applicable to a sale of 10 units. this does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. in the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a customs value under the provisions of article 2 is not appropriate.note to article 31. in applying article 3, the customs administration shall, wherever possible, use a sale of similar goods at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantities as the goods being valued. where no such sale is found, a sale of similar goods that takes place under any one of the following three conditions may be used:(a) a sale at the same commercial level but in different quantities;(b) a sale at a different commercial level but in substantially the same quantities; or(c) a sale at a different commercial level and in different quantities.2. having found a sale under any one of these three conditions adjustments will then be made, as the case may be, for:(a) quantity factors only;(b) commercial level factors only; or(c) both commercial level and quantity factors.3. the expression "and/or" allows the flexibility to use the sales and make the necessary adjustments in any one of the three conditions described above.4. for the purpose of article 3, the transaction value of similar imported goods means a customs value, adjusted as provided for in paragraphs 1(b) and 2, which has already been accepted under article 1.5. a condition for adjustment because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such adjustment, whether it leads to an increase or a decrease in the value, be made only on the basis of demonstrated evidence that clearly establishes the reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustment, e.g. valid price lists containing prices referring to different levels or different quantities. as an example of this, if the imported goods being valued consist of a shipment of 10 units and the only similar imported goods for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's price list and using that price applicable to a sale of 10 units. this does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being bona fide through sales at other quantities. in the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a customs value under the provisions of article 3 is not appropriate.note to article 51. the term "unit price at which . . . goods are sold in the greatest aggregate quantity" means the price at which the greatest number of units is sold in sales to persons who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods at the first commercial level after importation at which such sales take place.2. as an example of this, goods are sold from a price list which

importing country, as described in paragraph 1 above, to a person who supplies directly or indirectly free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale for export of the imported goods any of the elements specified in paragraph 1(b) of article 8, should not be taken into account in establishing the unit price for the purposes of article 5.6. it should be noted that "profit and general expenses" referred to in paragraph 1 of article 5 should be taken as a whole. the figure for the purposes of this deduction should be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the importer unless the importer's figures are inconsistent with those obtained in sales in the country of importation of imported goods of the same class or kind. where the importer's figures are inconsistent with such figures, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based upon relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the importer.7. the "general expenses" include the direct and indirect costs of marketing the goods in question.8. local taxes payable by reason of the sale of the goods for which a deduction is not made under the provisions of paragraph 1(a)(iv) of article 5 shall be deducted under the provisions of paragraph 1(a)(i) of article 5.9. in determining either the commissions or the usual profits and general expenses under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 5, the question whether certain goods are "of the same class or kind" as other goods must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the circumstances involved. sales in the country of importation of the narrowest group or range of imported goods of the same class or kind, which includes the goods being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, should be examined. for the purposes of article 5, "goods of the same class or kind" includes goods imported from the same country as the goods being valued as well as goods imported from other countries.10. for the purposes of paragraph 1(b) of article 5, the "earliest date" shall be the date by which sales of the imported goods or of identical or similar imported goods are made in sufficient quantity to establish the unit price.11. where the method in paragraph 2 of article 5 is used, deductions made for the value added by further processing shall be based on objective and quantifiable data relating to the cost of such work. accepted industry formulas, recipes, methods of construction, and other industry practices would form the basis of the calculations.12. it is recognized that the method of valuation provided for in paragraph 2 of article 5 would normally not be applicable when, as a result of the further processing, the imported goods lose their identity. however, there can be instances where, although the identity of the imported goods is lost, the value added by the processing can be determined accurately without unreasonable difficulty. on the other hand, there can also be instances where the imported goods maintain their identity but form such a minor element in the goods sold in the country of importation that the use of this valuation method would be unjustified. in view of the above, each situation of this type must be considered on a case-by-case basis.note to article 61. as a general rule, customs value is determined under this agreement on the basis of information readily available in the country of importation. in order to determine a computed value, however, it may be necessary to examine the costs of producing the goods being valued and other information which has to be obtained from outside the country of importation. furthermore, in most cases the producer of the goods will be outside the jurisdiction of the authorities of the country of importation. the use of the computed value method will generally be limited to those cases where the buyer and seller are related, and the producer is prepared to supply to the authorities of the country of importation the necessary costings and to provide facilities for any subsequent verification which may be necessary.2. the "cost or value" referred to in paragraph 1(a) of article 6 is to be determined on the basis of information relating to the production of the goods being valued supplied by or on behalf of the producer. it is to be based upon the commercial accounts of the producer, provided that such accounts are consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles applied in the country where the goods are produced.3. the "cost or value" shall include the cost of elements specified in paragraphs 1(a)(ii) and (iii) of article 8. it shall also include the value, apportioned as appropriate under the provisions of the relevant note to article 8, of any element specified in paragraph 1(b) of article 8 which has been supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer for use in connection with the production of the imported goods. the value of the elements specified in paragraph 1(b)(iv) of article 8 which are undertaken in the country of importation shall be included only to the extent that such elements are charged to the producer. it is to be understood that no cost or value of the elements referred to in this paragraph shall be counted twice in determining the computed value.4. the "amount for profit and general expenses" referred to in paragraph 1(b) of article 6 is to be determined on the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer unless the producer's figures are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the country of importation.5. it should be noted in this context that the "amount for profit and general expenses" has to be taken as a whole. it follows that if, in any particular case, the producer's profit figure is low and the producer's general expenses are high, the producer's profit and general expenses taken together may nevertheless be consistent with that usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind. such a situation might occur, for example, if a product were being launched in the country of importation and the producer accepted a nil or low profit to offset high general expenses associated with the launch. where the producer can demonstrate a low profit on sales of the imported goods because of particular commercial circumstances, the producer's actual profit figures should be taken into account provided that the producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and the producer's pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies in the branch of industry concerned. such a situation might occur, for example, where producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforeseeable drop in demand, or where they sell goods to complement a range of goods being produced in the country of importation and accept a low profit to maintain competitivity. where the producer's own figures for profit and general expenses are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the country of importation, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based upon relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the goods.6. where information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer is used for the purposes of determining a computed value, the authorities of the importing country shall inform the importer, if the latter so requests, of the source of such information, the data used and the calculations based upon such data, subject to the provisions of article 10.7. the "general expenses" referred to in paragraph 1(b) of article 6 covers the direct and indirect costs of producing and selling the goods for export which are not included under paragraph 1(a) of article 6.8. whether certain goods are "of the same class or kind" as other goods must be determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the circumstances involved. in determining the usual profits and general expenses under the provisions of article 6, sales for export to the country of importation of the narrowest group or range of goods, which includes the goods being valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, should be examined. for the purposes of article 6, "goods of the same class or kind" must be from the same country as the goods being valued.note to article 71. customs values determined under the provisions of article 7 should, to the greatest extent possible, be based on previously determined customs values.2. the methods of valuation to be employed under article 7 should be those laid down in articles 1 through 6 but a reasonable flexibility in the application of such methods would be in conformity with the aims and provisions of article 7.3. some examples of reasonable flexibility are as follows:(a) identical goods - the requirement that the identical goods should be exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued could be flexibly interpreted; identical imported goods produced in a country other than the country of exportation of the goods being valued could be the basis for customs valuation; customs values of identical imported goods already determined under the provisions of articles 5 and 6 could be used.(b) similar goods - the requirement that the similar goods should be exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued could be flexibly interpreted; similar imported goods produced in a country other than the country of exportation of the goods being valued could be the basis for customs valuation; customs values of similar imported goods already determined under the provisions of articles 5 and 6 could be used.(c) deductive method - the requirement that the goods shall have been sold in the "condition as imported" in paragraph 1(a) of article 5 could be flexibly interpreted; the "90 days" requirement could be administered flexibly.note to article 8paragraph 1(a)(i)the term "buying commissions" means fees paid by an importer to the importer's agent for the service of representing the importer abroad in the purchase of the goods being valued.paragraph 1(b)(ii)1. there are two factors involved in the apportionment of the elements specified in paragraph 1(b)(ii) of article 8 to the imported goods - the value of the element itself and the way in which that value is to be apportioned to the imported goods. the apportionment of these elements should be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to the circumstances and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.2. concerning the value of the element, if the importer acquires the element from a seller not related to the importer at a given cost, the value of the element is that cost. if the element was produced by the importer or by a person related to the importer, its value would be the cost of producing it. if the element had been previously used by the importer, regardless of whether it had been acquired or produced by such importer, the original cost of acquisition or production would have to be adjusted downward to reflect its use in order to arrive at the value of the element.3. once a value has been determined for the element, it is necessary to apportion that value to the imported goods. various possibilities exist. for example, the value might be apportioned to the first shipment if the importer wishes to pay duty on the entire value at one time. as another example, the importer may request that the value be apportioned over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment. as a further example, the importer may request that the value be apportioned over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. the method of apportionment used will depend upon the documentation provided by the importer.4. as an illustration of the above, an importer provides the producer with a mould to be used in the production of the imported goods and contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units. by the time of arrival of the first shipment of 1,000 units, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. the importer may request the customs administration to apportion the value of the mould over 1,000 units, 4,000 units or 10,000 units.paragraph 1(b)(iv)1. additions for the elements specified in paragraph 1(b)(iv) of article 8 should be based on objective and quantifiable data. in order to minimize the burden for both the importer and customs administration in determining the values to be added, data readily available in the buyer's commercial record system should be used in so far as possible.2. for those elements supplied by the buyer which were purchased or leased by the buyer, the addition would be the cost of the purchase or the lease. no addition shall be made for those elements available in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.3. the ease with which it may be possible to calculate the values to be added will depend on a particular firm's structure and management practice, as well as its accounting methods.4. for example, it is possible that a firm which imports a variety of products from several countries maintains the records of its design centre outside the country of importation in such a way as to show accurately the costs attributable to a given product. in such cases, a direct adjustment may appropriately be made under the provisions of article 8.5. in another case, a firm may carry the cost of the design centre outside the country of importation as a general overhead expense without allocation to specific products. in this instance, an appropriate adjustment could be made under the provisions of article 8 with respect to the imported goods by apportioning total design centre costs over total production benefiting from the design centre and adding such apportioned cost on a unit basis to imports.6. variations in the above circumstances will, of course, require different factors to be considered in determining the proper method of allocation.7. in cases where the production of the element in question involves a number of countries and over a period of time, the adjustment should be limited to the value actually added to that element outside the country of importation.paragraph 1(c)1. the royalties and licence fees referred to in paragraph 1(c) of article 8 may include, among other things, payments in respect to patents, trade marks and copyrights. however, the charges for the right to reproduce the imported goods in the country of importation shall not be added to the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods in determining the customs value.2. payments made by the buyer for the right to distribute or resell the imported goods shall not be added to the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods if such payments are not a condition of the sale for export to the country of importation of the imported goods.paragraph 3where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made under the provisions of article 8, the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of article 1. as an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price in a sale in the importing country of a litre of a particular product that was imported by the kilogram and made up into a solution after importation. if the royalty is based partially on the imported goods and partially on other factors which have nothing to do with the imported goods (such as when the imported goods are mixed with domestic ingredients and are no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the buyer and the seller), it would be inappropriate to attempt to make an addition for the royalty. however, if the amount of this royalty is based only on the imported goods and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made.note to article 9for the purposes of article 9, "time of importation" may include the time of entry for customs purposes.note to article 111 ARTICLE 11 provides the importer with the right to appeal against a valuation determination made by the customs administration for the goods being valued. appeal may first be to a higher level in the customs administration, but the importer shall have the right in the final instance to appeal to the judiciary.2. "without penalty" means that the importer shall not be subject to a fine or threat of fine merely because the importer chose to exercise the right of appeal. payment of normal court costs and lawyers' fees shall not be considered to be a fine.3. however, nothing in article 11 shall prevent a member from requiring full payment of assessed customs duties prior to an appeal.note to article 15paragraph 4for the purposes of article 15, the term "persons" includes a legal person, where appropriate.paragraph 4(e)for the purposes of this agreement, one person shall be deemed to control another when the former is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the latter ANNEX iitechnical committee on customs valuation1. in accordance with article 18 of this agreement, the technical committee shall be established under the auspices of the ccc with a view to ensuring, at the technical level, uniformity in interpretation and application of this agreement.2. the responsibilities of the technical committee shall include the following:(a) to examine specific technical problems arising in the day-to-day administration of the customs valuation system of members and to give advisory opinions on appropriate solutions based upon the facts presented;(b) to study, as requested, valuation laws, procedures and practices as they relate to this agreement and to

ccc which are not members of the wto may be represented at meetings of the technical committee by one delegate and one or more alternates. such representatives shall attend meetings of the technical committee as observers.7. subject to the approval of the chairman of the technical committee, the secretary-general of the ccc (referred to in this annex as "the secretary-general") may invite representatives of governments which are neither members of the wto nor members of the ccc and representatives of international governmental and trade organizations to attend meetings of the technical committee as observers.8. nominations of delegates, alternates and advisers to meetings of the technical committee shall be made to the secretary-general.technical committee meetings9. the technical committee shall meet as necessary but at least two times a year. the date of each meeting shall be fixed by the technical committee at its preceding session. the date of the meeting may be varied either at the request of any member of the technical committee concurred in by a simple majority of the members of the technical committee or, in cases requiring urgent attention, at the request of the chairman. notwithstanding the provisions in sentence 1 of this paragraph, the technical committee shall meet as necessary to consider matters referred to it by a panel under the provisions of article 19 of this agreement.10. the meetings of the technical committee shall be held at the headquarters of the ccc unless otherwise decided.11. the secretary-general shall inform all members of the technical committee and those included under paragraphs 6 and 7 at least 30 days in advance, except in urgent cases, of the opening date of each session of the technical committee.agenda12. a provisional agenda for each session shall be drawn up by the secretary-general and circulated to the members of the technical committee and to those included under paragraphs 6 and 7 at least 30 days in advance of the session, except in urgent cases. this agenda shall comprise all items whose inclusion has been approved by the technical committee during its preceding session, all items included by the chairman on the chairman's own initiative, and all items whose inclusion has been requested by the secretary-general, by the committee or by any member of the technical committee.13. the technical committee shall determine its agenda at the opening of each session. during the session the agenda may be altered at any time by the technical committee.officers and conduct of business14. the technical committee shall elect from among the delegates of its members a chairman and one or more vice-chairmen. the chairman and vice-chairmen shall each hold office for a period of one year. the retiring chairman and vice-chairmen are eligible for re-election. the mandate of a chairman or vice-chairman who no longer represents a member of the technical committee shall terminate automatically.15. if the chairman is absent from any meeting or part thereof, a vice-chairman shall preside. in that event, the latter shall have the same powers and duties as the chairman.16. the chairman of the meeting shall participate in the proceedings of the technical committee as such and not as the representative of a member of the technical committee.17. in addition to exercising the other powers conferred upon the chairman by these rules, the chairman shall declare the opening and closing of each meeting, direct the discussion, accord the right to speak, and, pursuant to these rules, have control of the proceedings. the chairman may also call a speaker to order if the speaker's remarks are not relevant.18. during discussion of any matter a delegation may raise a point of order. in this event, the chairman shall immediately state a ruling. if this ruling is challenged, the chairman shall submit it to the meeting for decision and it shall stand unless overruled.19. the secretary-general, or officers of the ccc secretariat designated by the secretary-general, shall perform the secretarial work of meetings of the technical committee.quorum and voting20. representatives of a simple majority of the members of the technical committee shall constitute a quorum.21. each member of the technical committee shall have one vote. a decision of the technical committee shall be taken by a majority comprising at least two thirds of the members present. regardless of the outcome of the vote on a particular matter, the technical committee shall be free to make a full report to the committee and to the ccc on that matter indicating the different views expressed in the relevant discussions. notwithstanding the above provisions of this paragraph, on matters referred to it by a panel, the technical committee shall take decisions by consensus. where no agreement is reached in the technical committee on the question referred to it by a panel, the technical committee shall provide a report detailing the facts of the matter and indicating the views of the members.languages and records22. the official languages of the technical committee shall be english, french and spanish. speeches or statements made in any of these three languages shall be immediately translated into the other official languages unless all delegations agree to dispense with translation. speeches or statements made in any other language shall be translated into english, french and spanish, subject to the same conditions, but in that event the delegation concerned shall provide the translation into english, french or spanish. only english, french and spanish shall be used for the official documents of the technical committee. memoranda and correspondence for the consideration of the technical committee must be presented in one of the official languages.23. the technical committee shall draw up a report of all its sessions and, if the chairman considers it necessary, minutes or summary records of its meetings. the chairman or a designee of the chairman shall report on the work of the technical committee at each meeting of the committee and at each meeting of the ccc ANNEX iii1. the five-year delay in the application of the provisions of the agreement by developing country members provided for in paragraph 1 of article 20 may, in practice, be insufficient for certain developing country members. in such cases a developing country member may request before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 1 of article 20 an extension of such period, it being understood that the members will give sympathetic consideration to such a request in cases where the developing country member in question can show good cause.2. developing countries which currently value goods on the basis of officially established minimum values may wish to make a reservation to enable them to retain such values on a limited and transitional basis under such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the members.3. developing countries which consider that the reversal of the sequential order at the request of the importer provided for in article 4 of the agreement may give rise to real difficulties for them may wish to make a reservation to article 4 in the following terms:"the government of . . . reserves the right to provide that the relevant provision of article 4 of the agreement shall apply only when the customs authorities agree to the request to reverse the order of articles 5 and 6."if developing countries make such a reservation, the members shall consent to it under article 21 of the agreement.4. developing countries may wish to make a reservation with respect to paragraph 2 of article 5 of the agreement in the following terms:"the government of . . . reserves the right to provide that paragraph 2 of article 5 of the agreement shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the relevant note thereto whether or not the importer so requests."if developing countries make such a reservation, the members shall consent to it under article 21 of the agreement.5. certain developing countries may have problems in the implementation of article 1 of the agreement insofar as it relates to importations into their countries by sole agents, sole distributors and sole concessionaires. if such problems arise in practice in developing country members applying the agreement, a study of this question shall be made, at the request of such members, with a view to finding appropriate solutions.6 ARTICLE 17 recognizes that in applying the agreement, customs administrations may need to make enquiries concerning the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented to them for customs valuation purposes. the article thus acknowledges that enquiries may be made which are, for example, aimed at verifying that the elements of value declared or presented to customs in connection with a determination of customs value are complete and correct. members, subject to their national laws and procedures, have the right to expect the full cooperation of importers in these enquiries.7. the price actually paid or payable includes all payments actually made or to be made as a condition of sale of the imported goods, by the buyer to the seller, or by the buyer to a third party to satisfy an obligation of the seller.agreement on preshipment inspectionmembers,noting that ministers on 20 september 1986 agreed that the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations shall aim to "bring about further liberalization and expansion of world trade", "strengthen the role of gatt" and "increase the responsiveness of the gatt system to the evolving international economic environment";noting that a number of developing country members have recourse to preshipment inspection;recognizing the need of developing countries to do so for as long and in so far as it is necessary to verify the quality, quantity or price of imported goods;mindful that such programmes must be carried out without giving rise to unnecessary delays or unequal treatment;noting that this inspection is by definition carried out on the territory of exporter members;recognizing the need to establish an agreed international framework of rights and obligations of both user members and exporter members;recognizing that the principles and obligations of gatt 1994 apply to those activities of preshipment inspection entities that are mandated by governments that are members of the wto;recognizing that it is desirable to provide transparency of the operation of preshipment inspection entities and of laws and regulations relating to preshipment inspection;desiring to provide for the speedy, effective and equitable resolution of disputes between exporters and preshipment inspection entities arising under this agreement;hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1coverage - definitions1. this agreement shall apply to all preshipment inspection activities carried out on the territory of members, whether such activities are contracted or mandated by the government, or any government body, of a member.2. the term "user member" means a member of which the government or any government body contracts for or mandates the use of preshipment inspection activities.3. preshipment inspection activities are all activities relating to the verification of the quality, the quantity, the price, including currency exchange rate and financial terms, and/or the customs classification of goods to be exported to the territory of the user member.4. the term "preshipment inspection entity" is any entity contracted or mandated by a member to carry out preshipment inspection activities.[53] ARTICLE 2obligations of user membersnon-discrimination1. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection activities are carried out in a non-discriminatory manner, and that the procedures and criteria employed in the conduct of these activities are objective and are applied on an equal basis to all exporters affected by such activities. they shall ensure uniform performance of inspection by all the inspectors of the preshipment inspection entities contracted or mandated by them.governmental requirements2. user members shall ensure that in the course of preshipment inspection activities relating to their laws, regulations and requirements, the provisions of paragraph 4 of article iii of gatt 1994 are respected to the extent that these are relevant.site of inspection3. user members shall ensure that all preshipment inspection activities, including the issuance of a clean report of findings or a note of non-issuance, are performed in the customs territory from which the goods are exported or, if the inspection cannot be carried out in that customs territory given the complex nature of the products involved, or if both parties agree, in the customs territory in which the goods are manufactured.standards4. user members shall ensure that quantity and quality inspections are performed in accordance with the standards defined by the seller and the buyer in the purchase agreement and that, in the absence of such standards, relevant international standards[54] apply.transparency5. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection activities are conducted in a transparent manner.6. user members shall ensure that, when initially contacted by exporters, preshipment inspection entities provide to the exporters a list of all the information which is necessary for the exporters to comply with inspection requirements. the preshipment inspection entities shall provide the actual information when so requested by exporters. this information shall include a reference to the laws and regulations of user members relating to preshipment inspection activities, and shall also include the procedures and criteria used for inspection and for price and currency exchange-rate verification purposes, the exporters' rights vis-...-vis the inspection entities, and the appeals procedures set up under paragraph 21. additional procedural requirements or changes in existing procedures shall not be applied to a shipment unless the exporter concerned is informed of these changes at the time the inspection date is arranged. however, in emergency situations of the types addressed by articles xx and xxi of gatt 1994, such additional requirements or changes may be applied to a shipment before the exporter has been informed. this assistance shall not, however, relieve exporters from their obligations in respect of compliance with the import regulations of the user members.7. user members shall ensure that the information referred to in paragraph 6 is made available to exporters in a convenient manner, and that the preshipment inspection offices maintained by preshipment inspection entities serve as information points where this information is available.8. user members shall publish promptly all applicable laws and regulations relating to preshipment inspection activities in such a manner as to enable other governments and traders to become acquainted with them.protection of confidential business information9. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection entities treat all information received in the course of the preshipment inspection as business confidential to the extent that such information is not already published, generally available to third parties, or otherwise in the public domain. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection entities maintain procedures to this end.10. user members shall provide information to members on request on the measures they are taking to give effect to paragraph 9. the provisions of this paragraph shall not require any member to disclose confidential information the disclosure of which would jeopardize the effectiveness of the preshipment inspection programmes or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interest of particular enterprises, public or private.11. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection entities do not divulge confidential business information to any third party, except that preshipment inspection entities may share this information with the government entities that have contracted or mandated them. user members shall ensure that confidential business information which they receive from preshipment inspection entities contracted or mandated by them is adequately safeguarded. preshipment inspection entities shall share confidential business information with the governments contracting or mandating them only to the extent that such information is customarily required for letters of credit or other forms of payment or for customs, import licensing or exchange control purposes.12. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection entities do not request exporters to provide information regarding:(a) manufacturing data related to patented, licensed or undisclosed processes, or to processes for which a patent is pending;(b) unpublished technical data other than data necessary to demonstrate compliance with technical regulations or standards;(c) internal pricing, including manufacturing costs;(d) profit levels;(e) the terms of contracts between exporters and their suppliers unless it is not otherwise possible for the entity to conduct the inspection in question. in such cases, the entity shall only request the information necessary for this purpose.13. the information referred to in paragraph 12, which preshipment inspection entities shall not otherwise request, may be released voluntarily by the exporter to illustrate a specific case.conflicts of interest14. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection entities, bearing in mind also the provisions on protection of confidential business information in paragraphs 9 through 13, maintain procedures to avoid conflicts of interest:(a) between preshipment inspection entities and any related entities of the preshipment inspection entities in question, including any entities in which the latter have a financial or commercial interest or any entities which have a financial interest in the preshipment inspection entities in question, and whose shipments the preshipment inspection entities are to inspect;(b) between preshipment inspection entities and any other entities, including other entities subject to preshipment inspection, with the exception of the government entities contracting or mandating the inspections;(c) with divisions of preshipment inspection entities engaged in activities other than those required to carry out the inspection process.delays15. user members shall ensure that preshipment inspection entities avoid unreasonable delays in inspection of shipments. user members shall ensure that, once a preshipment inspection entity and an exporter

country of exportation at or about the same time, under competitive and comparable conditions of sale, in conformity with customary commercial practices and net of any applicable standard discounts. such comparison shall be based on the following:(i) only prices providing a valid basis of comparison shall be used, taking into account the relevant economic factors pertaining to the country of

mechanism and the speedy, effective and equitable resolution of disputes arising under this agreement;hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1general provisions1. for the purpose of this agreement, import licensing is defined as administrative procedures[65] used for the operation of import licensing regimes requiring the submission of an application or other documentation (other than that required for customs purposes) to the relevant administrative body as a prior condition for importation into the customs territory of the importing member.2. members shall ensure that the administrative procedures used to implement import licensing regimes are in conformity with the relevant provisions of gatt 1994 including its annexes and protocols, as interpreted by this agreement, with a view to preventing trade distortions that may arise from an inappropriate operation of those procedures, taking into account the economic development purposes and financial and trade needs of developing country members.[66]3. the rules for import licensing procedures shall be neutral in application and administered in a fair and equitable manner.4. (a) the rules and all information concerning procedures for the submission of applications, including the eligibility of persons, firms and institutions to make such applications, the administrative body(ies) to be approached, and the lists of products subject to the licensing requirement shall be published, in the sources notified to the committee on import licensing provided for in article 4 (referred to in this agreement as "the committee"), in such a manner as to enable governments[67] and traders to become acquainted with them. such publication shall take place, whenever practicable, 21 days prior to the effective date of the requirement but in all events not later than such effective date. any exception, derogations or changes in or from the rules concerning licensing procedures or the list of products subject to import licensing shall also be published in the same manner and within the same time periods as specified above. copies of these publications shall also be made available to the secretariat.(b) members which wish to make comments in writing shall be provided the opportunity to discuss these comments upon request. the concerned member shall give due consideration to these comments and results of discussion.5. application forms and, where applicable, renewal forms shall be as simple as possible. such documents and information as are considered strictly necessary for the proper functioning of the licensing regime may be required on application.6. application procedures and, where applicable, renewal procedures shall be as simple as possible. applicants shall be allowed a reasonable period for the submission of licence applications. where there is a closing date, this period should be at least 21 days with provision for extension in circumstances where insufficient applications have been received within this period. applicants shall have to approach only one administrative body in connection with an application. where it is strictly indispensable to approach more than one administrative body, applicants shall not need to approach more than three administrative bodies.7. no application shall be refused for minor documentation errors which do not alter basic data contained therein. no penalty greater than necessary to serve merely as a warning shall be imposed in respect of any omission or mistake in documentation or procedures which is obviously made without fraudulent intent or gross negligence.8. licensed imports shall not be refused for minor variations in value, quantity or weight from the amount designated on the licence due to differences occurring during shipment, differences incidental to bulk loading and other minor differences consistent with normal commercial practice.9. the foreign exchange necessary to pay for licensed imports shall be made available to licence holders on the same basis as to importers of goods not requiring import licences.10. with regard to security exceptions, the provisions of article xxi of gatt 1994 apply.11. the provisions of this agreement shall not require any member to disclose confidential information which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private ARTICLE 2automatic import licensing[68]1. automatic import licensing is defined as import licensing where approval of the application is granted in all cases, and which is in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2(a).2. the following provisions[69], in addition to those in paragraphs 1 through 11 of article 1 and paragraph 1 of this article, shall apply to automatic import licensing procedures:(a) automatic licensing procedures shall not be administered in such a manner as to have restricting effects on imports subject to automatic licensing. automatic licensing procedures shall be deemed to have trade-restricting effects unless, inter alia:(i) any person, firm or institution which fulfils the legal requirements of the importing member for engaging in import operations involving products subject to automatic licensing is equally eligible to apply for and to obtain import licences;(ii) applications for licences may be submitted on any working day prior to the customs clearance of the goods;(iii) applications for licences when submitted in appropriate and complete form are approved immediately on receipt, to the extent administratively feasible, but within a maximum of 10 working days;(b) members recognize that automatic import licensing may be necessary whenever other appropriate procedures are not available. automatic import licensing may be maintained as long as the circumstances which gave rise to its introduction prevail and as long as its underlying administrative purposes cannot be achieved in a more appropriate way ARTICLE 3non-automatic import licensing1. the following provisions, in addition to those in paragraphs 1 through 11 of article 1, shall apply to non-automatic import licensing procedures. non-automatic import licensing procedures are defined as import licensing not falling within the definition contained in paragraph 1 of article 2.2. non-automatic licensing shall not have trade-restrictive or -distortive effects on imports additional to those caused by the imposition of the restriction. non-automatic licensing procedures shall correspond in scope and duration to the measure they are used to implement, and shall be no more administratively burdensome than absolutely necessary to administer the measure.3. in the case of licensing requirements for purposes other than the implementation of quantitative restrictions, members shall publish sufficient information for other members and traders to know the basis for granting and/or allocating licences.4. where a member provides the possibility for persons, firms or institutions to request exceptions or derogations from a licensing requirement, it shall include this fact in the information published under paragraph 4 of article 1 as well as information on how to make such a request and, to the extent possible, an indication of the circumstances under which requests would be considered.5. (a) members shall provide, upon the request of any member having an interest in the trade in the product concerned, all relevant information concerning:(i) the administration of the restrictions;(ii) the import licences granted over a recent period;(iii) the distribution of such licences among supplying countries;(iv) where practicable, import statistics (i.e. value and/or volume) with respect to the products subject to import licensing. developing country members would not be expected to take additional administrative or financial burdens on this account;(b) members administering quotas by means of licensing shall publish the overall amount of quotas to be applied by quantity and/or value, the opening and closing dates of quotas, and any change thereof, within the time periods specified in paragraph 4 of article 1 and in such a manner as to enable governments and traders to become acquainted with them;(c) in the case of quotas allocated among supplying countries, the member applying the restrictions shall promptly inform all other members having an interest in supplying the product concerned of the shares in the quota currently allocated, by quantity or value, to the various supplying countries and shall publish this information within the time periods specified in paragraph 4 of article 1 and in such a manner as to enable governments and traders to become acquainted with them;(d) where situations arise which make it necessary to provide for an early opening date of quotas, the information referred to in paragraph 4 of article 1 should be published within the time-periods specified in paragraph 4 of article 1 and in such a manner as to enable governments and traders to become acquainted with them;(e) any person, firm or institution which fulfils the legal and administrative requirements of the importing member shall be equally eligible to apply and to be considered for a licence. if the licence application is not approved, the applicant shall, on request, be given the reason therefor and shall have a right of appeal or review in accordance with the domestic legislation or procedures of the importing member;(f) the period for processing applications shall, except when not possible for reasons outside the control of the member, not be longer than 30 days if applications are considered as and when received, i.e. on a first-come first-served basis, and no longer than 60 days if all applications are considered simultaneously. in the latter case, the period for processing applications shall be considered to begin on the day following the closing date of the announced application period;(g) the period of licence validity shall be of reasonable duration and not be so short as to preclude imports. the period of licence validity shall not preclude imports from distant sources, except in special cases where imports are necessary to meet unforeseen short-term requirements;(h) when administering quotas, members shall not prevent importation from being effected in accordance with the issued licences, and shall not discourage the full utilization of quotas;(i) when issuing licences, members shall take into account the desirability of issuing licences for products in economic quantities;(j) in allocating licences, the member should consider the import performance of the applicant. in this regard, consideration should be given as to whether licences issued to applicants in the past have been fully utilized during a recent representative period. in cases where licences have not been fully utilized, the member shall examine the reasons for this and take these reasons into consideration when allocating new licences. consideration shall also be given to ensuring a reasonable distribution of licences to new importers, taking into account the desirability of issuing licences for products in economic quantities. in this regard, special consideration should be given to those importers importing products originating in developing country members and, in particular, the least-developed country members;(k) in the case of quotas administered through licences which are not allocated among supplying countries, licence holders[70] shall be free to choose the sources of imports. in the case of quotas allocated among supplying countries, the licence shall clearly stipulate the country or countries;(l) in applying paragraph 8 of article 1, compensating adjustments may be made in future licence allocations where imports exceeded a previous licence level ARTICLE 4institutionsthere is hereby established a committee on import licensing composed of representatives from each of the members. the committee shall elect its own chairman and vice-chairman and shall meet as necessary for the purpose of affording members the opportunity of consulting on any matters relating to the operation of this agreement or the furtherance of its objectives ARTICLE 5notification1. members which institute licensing procedures or changes in these procedures shall notify the committee of such within 60 days of publication.2. notifications of the institution of import licensing procedures shall include the following information:(a) list of products subject to licensing procedures;(b) contact point for information on eligibility;(c) administrative body(ies) for submission of applications;(d) date and name of publication where licensing procedures are published;(e) indication of whether the licensing procedure is automatic or non-automatic according to definitions contained in articles 2 and 3;(f) in the case of automatic import licensing procedures, their administrative purpose;(g) in the case of non-automatic import licensing procedures, indication of the measure being implemented through the licensing procedure; and(h) expected duration of the licensing procedure if this can be estimated with some probability, and if not, reason why this information cannot be provided.3. notifications of changes in import licensing procedures shall indicate the elements mentioned above, if changes in such occur.4. members shall notify the committee of the publication(s) in which the information required in paragraph 4 of article 1 will be published.5. any interested member which considers that another member has not notified the institution of a licensing procedure or changes therein in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 through 3 may bring the matter to the attention of such other member. if notification is not made promptly thereafter, such member may itself notify the licensing procedure or changes therein, including all relevant and available information ARTICLE 6consultation and dispute settlementconsultations and the settlement of disputes with respect to any matter affecting the operation of this agreement shall be subject to the provisions of articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1994, as elaborated and applied by the dispute settlement understanding ARTICLE 7review1. the committee shall review as necessary, but at least once every two years, the implementation and operation of this agreement, taking into account the objectives thereof, and the rights and obligations contained therein.2. as a basis for the committee review, the secretariat shall prepare a factual report based on information provided under article 5, responses to the annual questionnaire on import licensing procedures[71] and other relevant reliable information which is available to it. this report shall provide a synopsis of the aforementioned information, in particular indicating any changes or developments during the period under review, and including any other information as agreed by the committee.3. members undertake to complete the annual questionnaire on import licensing procedures promptly and in full.4. the committee shall inform the council for trade in goods of developments during the period covered by such reviews ARTICLE 8final provisionsreservations1. reservations may not be entered in respect of any of the provisions of this agreement without the consent of the other members.domestic legislation2. (a) each member shall ensure, not later than the date of entry into force of the wto agreement for it, the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of this agreement.(b) each member shall inform the committee of any changes in its laws and regulations relevant to this agreement and in the administration of such laws and regulations.agreement on subsidies and countervailing measuresmembers hereby agree as follows:part i: general provisions ARTICLE 1definition of a subsidy1.1 for the purpose of this agreement, a subsidy shall be deemed to exist if:(a) (1) there is a financial contribution by a government or any public body within the territory of a member (referred to in this agreement as "government"), i.e. where:(i) a government practice involves a direct transfer of funds (e.g. grants, loans, and equity infusion), potential direct transfers of funds or liabilities (e.g. loan guarantees);(ii) government revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not collected (e.g. fiscal incentives such as tax credits)[72];(iii) a government provides goods or services other than general infrastructure, or purchases goods;(iv) a government makes payments to a funding mechanism, or entrusts or directs a private body to carry out one or more of the type of functions illustrated in (i) to (iii) above which would normally be vested in the government and the practice, in no real sense, differs from practices normally followed by governments;or(a) (2) there is any form of income or price support in the sense of article xvi of gatt 1994;and(b) a benefit is thereby conferred.1.2 a subsidy as defined in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provisions of part ii or shall be subject to the provisions of part iii or v only if such a subsidy is specific in accordance with the provisions of article 2 ARTICLE 2specificity2.1 in order to determine whether a subsidy, as defined in paragraph 1 of article 1, is specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries (referred to in this agreement as "certain enterprises") within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, the following principles shall apply:(a) where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, explicitly limits access to a subsidy to certain enterprises, such subsidy shall be specific.(b) where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions[73] governing the eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, specificity shall not exist, provided that the eligibility is automatic and that such criteria and conditions are strictly adhered to. the criteria or conditions must be clearly spelled out in law, regulation, or other official document, so as to be capable of verification.(c) if, notwithstanding any appearance of non-specificity resulting from the application of the principles laid down in subparagraphs (a) and (b), there are reasons to believe that the subsidy may in fact be specific, other factors may be considered. such factors are: use of a subsidy programme by a limited number of certain enterprises, predominant use by certain enterprises, the granting of disproportionately large amounts of subsidy to certain enterprises, and the manner in which discretion has been exercised by the granting authority in the decision to grant a subsidy.[74] in applying this subparagraph, account shall be taken of the extent of diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, as well as of the length of time during which the subsidy programme has been in operation.2.2 a subsidy which is limited to certain enterprises located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the granting authority shall be specific. it is understood that the setting or change of generally applicable tax rates by all levels of government entitled to do so shall not be deemed to be a specific subsidy for the purposes of this agreement.2.3 any subsidy falling under the provisions of article 3 shall be deemed to be specific.2.4 any determination of specificity under the provisions of this article shall be clearly substantiated on the basis of positive evidence.part ii: prohibited subsidies ARTICLE 3prohibition3.1 except as provided in the agreement on agriculture, the following subsidies, within the meaning of article 1, shall be prohibited:(a) subsidies contingent, in law or in fact[75], whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon export performance, including those illustrated in annex i[76];(b) subsidies contingent, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over imported goods.3.2 a member shall neither grant nor maintain subsidies referred to in paragraph 1 ARTICLE 4remedies4.1 whenever a member has reason to believe that a prohibited subsidy is being granted or maintained by another member, such member may request consultations with such other member.4.2 a request for consultations under paragraph 1 shall include a statement of available evidence with regard to the existence and nature of the subsidy in question.4.3 upon request for consultations under paragraph 1, the member believed to be granting or maintaining the subsidy in question shall enter into such consultations as quickly as possible. the purpose of the consultations shall be to clarify the facts of the situation and to arrive at a mutually agreed solution.4.4 if no mutually agreed solution has been reached within 30 days[77] of the request for consultations, any member party to such consultations may refer the matter to the dispute settlement body ("dsb") for the immediate establishment of a panel, unless the dsb decides by consensus not to establish a panel.4.5 upon its establishment, the panel may request the assistance of the permanent group of experts[78] (referred to in this agreement as the "pge") with regard to whether the measure in question is a prohibited subsidy. if so requested, the pge shall immediately review the evidence with regard to the existence and nature of the measure in question and shall provide an opportunity for the member applying or maintaining the measure to demonstrate that the measure in question is not a prohibited subsidy. the pge shall report its conclusions to the panel within a time-limit determined by the panel. the pge's conclusions on the issue of whether or not the measure in question is a prohibited subsidy shall be accepted by the panel without modification.4.6 the panel shall submit its final report to the parties to the dispute. the report shall be circulated to all members within 90 days of the date of the composition and the establishment of the panel's terms of reference.4.7 if the measure in question is found to be a prohibited subsidy, the panel shall recommend that the subsidizing member withdraw the subsidy without delay. in this regard, the panel shall specify in its recommendation the time-period within which the measure must be withdrawn.4.8 within 30 days of the issuance of the panel's report to all members, the report shall be adopted by the dsb unless one of the parties to the dispute formally notifies the dsb of its decision to appeal or the dsb decides by consensus not to adopt the report.4.9 where a panel report is appealed, the appellate body shall issue its decision within 30 days from the date when the party to the dispute formally notifies its intention to appeal. when the appellate body considers that it cannot provide its report within 30 days, it shall inform the dsb in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will submit its report. in no case shall the proceedings exceed 60 days. the appellate report shall be adopted by the dsb and unconditionally accepted by the parties to the dispute unless the dsb decides by consensus not to adopt the appellate report within 20 days following its issuance to the members.[79]4.10 in the event the recommendation of the dsb is not followed within the time-period specified by the panel, which shall commence from the date of adoption of the panel's report or the appellate body's report, the dsb shall grant authorization to the complaining member to take appropriate[80] countermeasures, unless the dsb decides by consensus to reject the request.4.11 in the event a party to the dispute requests arbitration under paragraph 6 of article 22 of the dispute settlement understanding ("dsu"), the arbitrator shall determine whether the countermeasures are appropriate.[81]4.12 for purposes of disputes conducted pursuant to this article, except for time-periods specifically prescribed in this article, time-periods applicable under the dsu for the conduct of such disputes shall be half the time prescribed therein.part iii: actionable subsidies ARTICLE 5adverse effectsno member should cause, through the use of any subsidy referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 1, adverse effects to the interests of other members, i.e.:(a) injury to the domestic industry of another member[82];(b) nullification or impairment of benefits accruing directly or indirectly to other members under gatt 1994 in particular the benefits of concessions bound under article ii of gatt 1994[83];(c) serious prejudice to the interests of another member.[84]this article does not apply to subsidies maintained on agricultural products as provided in article 13 of the agreement on agriculture ARTICLE 6serious prejudice6.1 serious prejudice in the sense of paragraph (c) of article 5 shall be deemed to exist in the case of:(a) the total ad valorem subsidization[85] of a product exceeding 5 per cent[86];(b) subsidies to cover operating losses sustained by an industry;(c) subsidies to cover operating losses sustained by an enterprise, other than one-time measures which are non-recurrent and cannot be repeated for that enterprise and which are given merely to provide time for the development of long-term solutions and to avoid acute social problems;(d) direct forgiveness of debt, i.e. forgiveness of government-held debt, and grants to cover debt repayment.[87]6.2 notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, serious prejudice shall not be found if the subsidizing member demonstrates that the subsidy in question has not resulted in any of the effects enumerated in paragraph 3.6.3 serious prejudice in the sense of paragraph (c) of article 5 may arise in any case where one or several of the following apply:(a) the effect of the subsidy is to displace or impede the imports of a like product of another member into the market of the subsidizing member;(b) the effect of the subsidy is to displace or impede the exports of a like product of another member from a third country market;(c) the effect of the subsidy is a significant price undercutting by the subsidized product as compared with the price of a like product of another member in the same market or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market;(d) the effect of the subsidy is an increase in the world market share of the subsidizing member in a particular subsidized primary product or commodity[88] as compared to the average share it had during the previous period of three years and this increase follows a consistent trend over a period when subsidies have been granted.6.4 for the purpose of paragraph 3(b), the displacement or impeding of exports shall include any case in which, subject to the provisions of paragraph 7, it has been demonstrated that there has been a change in relative shares of the market to the disadvantage of the non-subsidized like product (over an appropriately representative period sufficient to demonstrate clear trends in the development of the market for the product concerned, which, in normal circumstances, shall be at least one year). "change in relative shares of the market" shall include any of the following situations: (a) there is an increase in the market share of the subsidized product; (b) the market share of the subsidized product remains constant in circumstances in which, in the absence of the subsidy, it would have declined; (c) the market share of the subsidized product declines, but at a slower rate than would have been the case in the absence of the subsidy.6.5 for the purpose of paragraph 3(c), price undercutting shall include any case in which such price undercutting has been demonstrated through a comparison of prices of the subsidized product with prices of a non-subsidized like product supplied to the same market. the comparison shall be made at the same level of trade and at comparable times, due account being taken of any other factor affecting price comparability. however, if such a direct comparison is not possible, the existence of price undercutting may be demonstrated on the basis of export unit values.6.6 each member in the market of which serious prejudice is alleged to have arisen shall, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of annex v, make available to the parties to a dispute arising under article 7, and to the panel established pursuant to paragraph 4 of article 7, all relevant information that can be obtained as to the changes in market shares of the parties to the dispute as well as concerning prices of the products involved.6.7 displacement or impediment resulting in serious prejudice shall not arise under paragraph 3 where any of the following circumstances exist[89] during the relevant period:(a) prohibition or restriction on exports of the like product from the complaining member or on imports from the complaining member into the third country market concerned;(b) decision by an importing government operating a monopoly of trade or state trading in the product concerned to shift, for non-commercial reasons, imports from the complaining member to another country or countries;(c) natural disasters, strikes, transport disruptions or other force majeure substantially affecting production, qualities, quantities or prices of the product available for export from the complaining member;(d) existence of arrangements limiting exports from the complaining member;(e) voluntary decrease in the availability for export of the product concerned from the complaining member (including, inter alia, a situation where firms in the complaining member have been autonomously reallocating exports of this product to new markets);(f) failure to conform to standards and other regulatory requirements in the importing country.6.8 in the absence of circumstances referred to in paragraph 7, the existence of serious prejudice should be determined on the basis of the information submitted to or obtained by the panel, including information submitted in accordance with the provisions of annex v.6.9 this article does not apply to subsidies maintained on agricultural products as provided in article 13 of the agreement on agriculture ARTICLE 7remedies7.1 except as provided in article 13 of the agreement on agriculture, whenever a member has reason to believe that any subsidy referred to in article 1, granted or maintained by another member, results in injury to its domestic industry, nullification or impairment or serious prejudice, such member may request consultations with such other member.7.2 a request for consultations under paragraph 1 shall include a statement of available evidence with regard to (a) the existence and nature of the subsidy in question, and (b) the injury caused to the domestic industry, or the nullification or impairment, or serious prejudice[90] caused to the interests of the member requesting consultations.7.3 upon request for consultations under paragraph 1, the member believed to be granting or maintaining the subsidy practice in question shall enter into such consultations as quickly as possible. the purpose of the consultations shall be to clarify the facts of the situation and to arrive at a mutually agreed solution.7.4 if consultations do not result in a mutually agreed solution within 60 days[91], any member party to such consultations may refer the matter to the dsb for the establishment of a panel, unless the dsb decides by consensus not to establish a panel. the composition of the panel and its terms of reference shall be established within 15 days from the date when it is established.7.5 the panel shall review the matter and shall submit its final report to the parties to the dispute. the report shall be circulated to all members within 120 days of the date of the composition and establishment of the panel's terms of reference.7.6 within 30 days of the issuance of the panel's report to all members, the report shall be adopted by the dsb[92] unless one of the parties to the dispute formally notifies the dsb of its decision to appeal or the dsb decides by consensus not to adopt the report.7.7 where a panel report is appealed, the appellate body shall issue its decision within 60 days from the date when the party to the dispute formally notifies its intention to appeal. when the appellate body considers that it cannot provide its report within 60 days, it shall inform the dsb in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will submit its report. in no case shall the proceedings exceed 90 days. the appellate report shall be adopted by the dsb and unconditionally accepted by the parties to the dispute unless the dsb decides by consensus not to adopt the appellate report within 20 days following its issuance to the members.[93]7.8 where a panel report or an appellate body report is adopted in which it is determined that any subsidy has resulted in adverse effects to the interests of another member within the meaning of article 5, the member granting or maintaining such subsidy shall take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or shall withdraw the subsidy.7.9 in the event the member has not taken appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects of the subsidy or withdraw the subsidy within six months from the date when the dsb adopts the panel report or the appellate body report, and in the absence of agreement on compensation, the dsb shall grant authorization to the complaining member to take countermeasures, commensurate with the degree and nature of the adverse effects determined to exist, unless the dsb decides by consensus to reject the request.7.10 in the event that a party to the dispute requests arbitration under paragraph 6 of article 22 of the dsu, the arbitrator shall determine whether the countermeasures are commensurate with the degree and nature of the adverse effects determined to exist.part iv: non-actionable subsidies ARTICLE 8identification of non-actionable subsidies8.1 the following subsidies shall be considered as non-actionable[94]:(a) subsidies which are not specific within the meaning of article 2;(b) subsidies which are specific within the meaning of article 2 but which meet all of the conditions provided for in paragraphs 2(a), 2(b) or 2(c) below.8.2 notwithstanding the provisions of parts iii and v, the following subsidies shall be non-actionable:(a) assistance for research activities conducted by firms or by higher education or research establishments on a contract basis with firms if:[95], [96], [97]the assistance covers[98] not more than 75 per cent of the costs of industrial research[99] or 50 per cent of the costs of pre-competitive development activity[100], [101];and provided that such assistance is limited exclusively to:(i) costs of personnel (researchers, technicians and other supporting staff employed exclusively in the research activity);(ii) costs of instruments, equipment, land and buildings used exclusively and permanently (except when disposed of on a commercial

research activity.(b) assistance to disadvantaged regions within the territory of a member given pursuant to a general framework of regional development[102] and non-specific (within the meaning of article 2) within eligible regions provided that:(i) each disadvantaged region must be a clearly designated contiguous geographical area with a definable economic and administrative identity;(ii) the region is considered as disadvantaged on the basis of neutral and objective criteria[103], indicating that the region's difficulties arise out of more than temporary circumstances; such criteria must be clearly spelled out in law, regulation, or other official document, so as to be capable of verification;(iii) the criteria shall include a measurement of economic development which shall be based on at least one of the following factors:- one of either income per capita or household income per capita, or gdp per capita, which must not be above 85 per cent of the average for the territory concerned;- unemployment rate, which must be at least 110 per cent of the average for the territory concerned;as measured over a three-year period; such measurement, however, may be a composite one and may include other factors.(c) assistance to promote adaptation of existing facilities[104] to new environmental requirements imposed by law and/or regulations which result in greater constraints and financial burden on firms, provided that the assistance:(i) is a one-time non-recurring measure; and(ii) is limited to 20 per cent of the cost of adaptation; and(iii) does not cover the cost of replacing and operating the assisted investment, which must be fully borne by firms; and(iv) is directly linked to and proportionate to a firm's planned reduction of nuisances and pollution, and does not cover any manufacturing cost savings which may be achieved; and(v) is available to all firms which can adopt the new equipment and/or production processes.8.3 a subsidy programme for which the provisions of paragraph 2 are invoked shall be notified in advance of its implementation to the committee in accordance with the provisions of part vii. any such notification shall be sufficiently precise to enable other members to evaluate the consistency of the programme with the conditions and criteria provided for in the relevant provisions of paragraph 2. members shall also provide the committee with yearly updates of such notifications, in particular by supplying information on global expenditure for each programme, and on any modification of the programme. other members shall have the right to request information about individual cases of subsidization under a notified programme.[105]8.4 upon request of a member, the secretariat shall review a notification made pursuant to paragraph 3 and, where necessary, may require additional information from the subsidizing member concerning the notified programme under review. the secretariat shall report its findings to the committee. the committee shall, upon request, promptly review the findings of the secretariat (or, if a review by the secretariat has not been requested, the notification itself), with a view to determining whether the conditions and criteria laid down in paragraph 2 have not been met. the procedure provided for in this paragraph shall be completed at the latest at the first regular meeting of the committee following the notification of a subsidy programme, provided that at least two months have elapsed between such notification and the regular meeting of the committee. the review procedure described in this paragraph shall also apply, upon request, to substantial modifications of a programme notified in the yearly updates referred to in paragraph 3.8.5 upon the request of a member, the determination by the committee referred to in paragraph 4, or a failure by the committee to make such a determination, as well as the violation, in individual cases, of the conditions set out in a notified programme, shall be submitted to binding arbitration. the arbitration body shall present its conclusions to the members within 120 days from the date when the matter was referred to the arbitration body. except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the dsu shall apply to arbitrations conducted under this paragraph ARTICLE 9consultations and authorized remedies9.1 if, in the course of implementation of a programme referred to in paragraph 2 of article 8, notwithstanding the fact that the programme is consistent with the criteria laid down in that paragraph, a member has reasons to believe that this programme has resulted in serious adverse effects to the domestic industry of that member, such as to cause damage which would be difficult to repair, such member may request consultations with the member granting or maintaining the subsidy.9.2 upon request for consultations under paragraph 1, the member granting or maintaining the subsidy programme in question shall enter into such consultations as quickly as possible. the purpose of the consultations shall be to clarify the facts of the situation and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution.9.3 if no mutually acceptable solution has been reached in consultations under paragraph 2 within 60 days of the request for such consultations, the requesting member may refer the matter to the committee.9.4 where a matter is referred to the committee, the committee shall immediately review the facts involved and the evidence of the effects referred to in paragraph 1. if the committee determines that such effects exist, it may recommend to the subsidizing member to modify this programme in such a way as to remove these effects. the committee shall present its conclusions within 120 days from the date when the matter is referred to it under paragraph 3. in the event the recommendation is not followed within six months, the committee shall authorize the requesting member to take appropriate countermeasures commensurate with the nature and degree of the effects determined to exist.part v: countervailing measures ARTICLE 10application of article vi of gatt 1994[106]members shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the imposition of a countervailing duty[107] on any product of the territory of any member imported into the territory of another member is in accordance with the provisions of article vi of gatt 1994 and the terms of this agreement. countervailing duties may only be imposed pursuant to investigations initiated[108] and conducted in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and the agreement on agriculture ARTICLE 11initiation and subsequent investigation11.1 except as provided in paragraph 6, an investigation to determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged subsidy shall be initiated upon a written application by or on behalf of the domestic industry.11.2 an application under paragraph 1 shall include sufficient evidence of the existence of (a) a subsidy and, if possible, its amount, (b) injury within the meaning of article vi of gatt 1994 as interpreted by this agreement, and (c) a causal link between the subsidized imports and the alleged injury. simple assertion, unsubstantiated by relevant evidence, cannot be considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. the application shall contain such information as is reasonably available to the applicant on the following:(i) the identity of the applicant and a description of the volume and value of the domestic production of the like product by the applicant. where a written application is made on behalf of the domestic industry, the application shall identify the industry on behalf of which the application is made by a list of all known domestic producers of the like product (or associations of domestic producers of the like product) and, to the extent possible, a description of the volume and value of domestic production of the like product accounted for by such producers;(ii) a complete description of the allegedly subsidized product, the names of the country or countries of origin or export in question, the identity of each known exporter or foreign producer and a list of known persons importing the product in question;(iii) evidence with regard to the existence, amount and nature of the subsidy in question;(iv) evidence that alleged injury to a domestic industry is caused by subsidized imports through the effects of the subsidies; this evidence includes information on the evolution of the volume of the allegedly subsidized imports, the effect of these imports on prices of the like product in the domestic market and the consequent impact of the imports on the domestic industry, as demonstrated by relevant factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the domestic industry, such as those listed in paragraphs 2 and 4 of article 15.11.3 the authorities shall review the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in the application to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation.11.4 an investigation shall not be initiated pursuant to paragraph 1 unless the authorities have determined, on the basis of an examination of the degree of support for, or opposition to, the application expressed[109] by domestic producers of the like product, that the application has been made by or on behalf of the domestic industry.[110] the application shall be considered to have been made "by or on behalf of the domestic industry" if it is supported by those domestic producers whose collective output constitutes more than 50 per cent of the total production of the like product produced by that portion of the domestic industry expressing either support for or opposition to the application. however, no investigation shall be initiated when domestic producers expressly supporting the application account for less than 25 per cent of total production of the like product produced by the domestic industry.11.5 the authorities shall avoid, unless a decision has been made to initiate an investigation, any publicizing of the application for the initiation of an investigation.11.6 if, in special circumstances, the authorities concerned decide to initiate an investigation without having received a written application by or on behalf of a domestic industry for the initiation of such investigation, they shall proceed only if they have sufficient evidence of the existence of a subsidy, injury and causal link, as described in paragraph 2, to justify the initiation of an investigation.11.7 the evidence of both subsidy and injury shall be considered simultaneously (a) in the decision whether or not to initiate an investigation and (b) thereafter, during the course of the investigation, starting on a date not later than the earliest date on which in accordance with the provisions of this agreement provisional measures may be applied.11.8 in cases where products are not imported directly from the country of origin but are exported to the importing member from an intermediate country, the provisions of this agreement shall be fully applicable and the transaction or transactions shall, for the purposes of this agreement, be regarded as having taken place between the country of origin and the importing member.11.9 an application under paragraph 1 shall be rejected and an investigation shall be terminated promptly as soon as the authorities concerned are satisfied that there is not sufficient evidence of either subsidization or of injury to justify proceeding with the case. there shall be immediate termination in cases where the amount of a subsidy is de minimis, or where the volume of subsidized imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible. for the purpose of this paragraph, the amount of the subsidy shall be considered to be de minimis if the subsidy is less than 1 per cent ad valorem.11.10 an investigation shall not hinder the procedures of customs clearance.11.11 investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded within one year, and in no case more than 18 months, after their initiation ARTICLE 12evidence12.1 interested members and all interested parties in a countervailing duty investigation shall be given notice of the information which the authorities require and ample opportunity to present in writing all evidence which they consider relevant in respect of the investigation in question.12.1.1 exporters, foreign producers or interested members receiving questionnaires used in a countervailing duty investigation shall be given at least 30 days for reply.[111] due consideration should be given to any request for an extension of the 30-day period and, upon cause shown, such an extension should be granted whenever practicable.12.1.2 subject to the requirement to protect confidential information, evidence presented in writing by one interested member or interested party shall be made available promptly to other interested members or interested parties participating in the investigation.12.1.3 as soon as an investigation has been initiated, the authorities shall provide the full text of the written application received under paragraph 1 of article 11 to the known exporters[112] and to the authorities of the exporting member and shall make it available, upon request, to other interested parties involved. due regard shall be paid to the protection of confidential information, as provided for in paragraph 4.12.2. interested members and interested parties also shall have the right, upon justification, to present information orally. where such information is provided orally, the interested members and interested parties subsequently shall be required to reduce such submissions to writing. any decision of the investigating authorities can only be based on such information and arguments as were on the written record of this authority and which were available to interested members and interested parties participating in the investigation, due account having been given to the need to protect confidential information.12.3 the authorities shall whenever practicable provide timely opportunities for all interested members and interested parties to see all information that is relevant to the presentation of their cases, that is not confidential as defined in paragraph 4, and that is used by the authorities in a countervailing duty investigation, and to prepare presentations on the basis of this information.12.4 any information which is by nature confidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom the supplier acquired the information), or which is provided on a confidential basis by parties to an investigation shall, upon good cause shown, be treated as such by the authorities. such information shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting it.[113]12.4.1 the authorities shall require interested members or interested parties providing confidential information to furnish non-confidential summaries thereof. these summaries shall be in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence. in exceptional circumstances, such members or parties may indicate that such information is not susceptible of summary. in such exceptional circumstances, a statement of the reasons why summarization is not possible must be provided.12.4.2 if the authorities find that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier of the information is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summary form, the authorities may disregard such information unless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the information is correct.[114]12.5 except in circumstances provided for in paragraph 7, the authorities shall during the course of an investigation satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the information supplied by interested members or interested parties upon which their findings are based.12.6 the investigating authorities may carry out investigations in the territory of other members as required, provided that they have notified in good time the member in question and unless that member objects to the investigation. further, the investigating authorities may carry out investigations on the premises of a firm and may examine the records of a firm if (a) the firm so agrees and (b) the member in question is notified and does not object. the procedures set forth in annex vi shall apply to investigations on the premises of a firm. subject to the requirement to protect confidential information, the authorities shall make the results of any such investigations available, or shall provide disclosure thereof pursuant to paragraph 8, to the firms to which they pertain and may make such results available to the applicants.12.7 in cases in which any interested member or interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, necessary information within a reasonable period or significantly impedes the investigation, preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative, may be made on the basis of the facts available.12.8 the authorities shall, before a final determination is made, inform all interested members and interested parties of the essential facts under consideration which form the basis for the decision whether to apply definitive measures. such disclosure should take place in sufficient time for the parties to defend their interests.12.9 for the purposes of this agreement, "interested parties" shall include:(i) an exporter or foreign producer or the importer of a product subject to investigation, or a trade or business association a majority of the members of which are producers, exporters or importers of such product; and(ii) a producer of the like product in the importing member or a trade and business association a majority of the members of which produce the like product in the territory of the importing member.this list shall not preclude members from allowing domestic or foreign parties other than those mentioned above to be included as interested parties.12.10 the authorities shall provide opportunities for industrial users of the product under investigation, and for representative consumer organizations in cases where the product is commonly sold at the retail level, to provide information which is relevant to the investigation regarding subsidization, injury and causality.12.11 the authorities shall take due account of any difficulties experienced by interested parties, in particular small companies, in supplying information requested, and shall provide any assistance practicable.12.12 the procedures set out above are not intended to prevent the authorities of a member from proceeding expeditiously with regard to initiating an investigation, reaching preliminary or final determinations, whether affirmative or negative, or from applying provisional or final measures, in accordance with relevant provisions of this agreement ARTICLE 13consultations13.1 as soon as possible after an application under article 11 is accepted, and in any event before the initiation of any investigation, members the products of which may be subject to such investigation shall be invited for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as to the matters referred to in paragraph 2 of article 11 and arriving at a mutually agreed solution.13.2 furthermore, throughout the period of investigation, members the products of which are the subject of the investigation shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to continue consultations, with a view to clarifying the factual situation and to arriving at a mutually agreed solution.[115]13.3 without prejudice to the obligation to afford reasonable opportunity for consultation, these provisions regarding consultations are not intended to prevent the authorities of a member from proceeding expeditiously with regard to initiating the investigation, reaching preliminary or final determinations, whether affirmative or negative, or from applying provisional or final measures, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.13.4 the member which intends to initiate any investigation or is conducting such an investigation shall permit, upon request, the member or members the products of which are subject to such investigation access to non-confidential evidence, including the non-confidential summary of confidential data being used for initiating or conducting the investigation ARTICLE 14calculation of the amount of a subsidy in terms of the benefit to the recipientfor the purpose of part v, any method used by the investigating authority to calculate the benefit to the recipient conferred pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 1 shall be provided for in the national legislation or implementing regulations of the member concerned and its application to each particular case shall be transparent and adequately explained. furthermore, any such method shall be consistent with the following guidelines:(a) government provision of equity capital shall not be considered as conferring a benefit, unless the investment decision can be regarded as inconsistent with the usual investment practice (including for the provision of risk capital) of private investors in the territory of that member;(b) a loan by a government shall not be considered as conferring a benefit, unless there is a difference between the amount that the firm receiving the loan pays on the government loan and the amount the firm would pay on a comparable commercial loan which the firm could actually obtain on the market. in this case the benefit shall be the difference between these two amounts;(c) a loan guarantee by a government shall not be considered as conferring a benefit, unless there is a difference between the amount that the firm receiving the guarantee pays on a loan guaranteed by the government and the amount that the firm would pay on a comparable commercial loan absent the government guarantee. in this case the benefit shall be the difference between these two amounts adjusted for any differences in fees;(d) the provision of goods or services or purchase of goods by a government shall not be considered as conferring a benefit unless the provision is made for less than adequate remuneration, or the purchase is made for more than adequate remuneration. the adequacy of remuneration shall be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions for the good or service in question in the country of provision or purchase (including price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation and other conditions of purchase or sale) ARTICLE 15determination of injury[116]15.1 a determination of injury for purposes of article vi of gatt 1994 shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of both (a) the volume of the subsidized imports and the effect of the subsidized imports on prices in the domestic market for like products[117] and (b) the consequent impact of these imports on the domestic producers of such products.15.2 with regard to the volume of the subsidized imports, the investigating authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant increase in subsidized imports, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the importing member. with regard to the effect of the subsidized imports on prices, the investigating authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the subsidized imports as compared with the price of a like product of the importing member, or whether the effect of such imports is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. no one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance.15.3 where imports of a product from more than one country are simultaneously subject to countervailing duty investigations, the investigating authorities may cumulatively assess the effects of such imports only if they determine that (a) the amount of subsidization established in relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as defined in paragraph 9 of article 11 and the volume of imports from each country is not negligible and (b) a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported products and the like domestic product.15.4 the examination of the impact of the subsidized imports on the domestic industry shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, or utilization of capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments and, in the case of agriculture, whether there has been an increased burden on government support programmes. this list is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance.15.5 it must be demonstrated that the subsidized imports are, through the effects[118] of subsidies, causing injury within the meaning of this agreement. the demonstration of a causal relationship between the subsidized imports and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence before the authorities. the authorities shall also examine any known factors other than the subsidized imports which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the subsidized imports. factors which may be relevant in this respect include, inter alia, the volumes and prices of non-subsidized imports of the product in question, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption, trade restrictive practices of and competition between the foreign and domestic producers, developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry.15.6 the effect of the subsidized imports shall be assessed in relation to the domestic production of the like product when available data permit the separate identification of that production on the basis of such criteria as the production process, producers' sales and profits. if such separate identification of that production is not possible, the effects of the subsidized imports shall be assessed by the examination of the production of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes the like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.15.7 a determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. the change in circumstances which would create a situation in which the subsidy would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent. in making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, the investigating authorities should consider, inter alia, such factors as:(i) nature of the subsidy or subsidies in question and the trade effects likely to arise therefrom;(ii) a significant rate of increase of subsidized imports into the domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially increased importation;(iii) sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of the exporter indicating the likelihood of substantially increased subsidized exports to the importing member's market, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports;(iv) whether imports are entering at prices that will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and would likely increase demand for further imports; and(v) inventories of the product being investigated.no one of these factors by itself can necessarily give decisive guidance but the totality of the factors considered must lead to the conclusion that further subsidized exports are imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur.15.8 with respect to cases where injury is threatened by subsidized imports, the application of countervailing measures shall be considered and decided with special care ARTICLE 16definition of domestic industry16.1 for the purposes of this agreement, the term "domestic industry" shall, except as provided in paragraph 2, be interpreted as referring to the domestic producers as a whole of the like products or to those of them whose collective output of the products constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of those products, except that when producers are related[119] to the exporters or importers or are themselves importers of the allegedly subsidized product or a like product from other countries, the term "domestic industry" may be interpreted as referring to the rest of the producers.16.2. in exceptional circumstances, the territory of a member may, for the production in question, be divided into two or more competitive markets and the producers within each market may be regarded as a separate industry if (a) the producers within such market sell all or almost all of their production of the product in question in that market, and (b) the demand in that market is not to any substantial degree supplied by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the territory. in such circumstances, injury may be found to exist even where a major portion of the total domestic industry is not injured, provided there is a concentration of subsidized imports into such an isolated market and provided further that the subsidized imports are causing injury to the producers of all or almost all of the production within such market.16.3 when the domestic industry has been interpreted as referring to the producers in a certain area, i.e. a market as defined in paragraph 2, countervailing duties shall be levied only on the products in question consigned for final consumption to that area. when the constitutional law of the importing member does not permit the levying of countervailing duties on such a basis, the importing member may levy the countervailing duties without limitation only if (a) the exporters shall have been given an opportunity to cease exporting at subsidized prices to the area concerned or otherwise give assurances pursuant to article 18, and adequate assurances in this regard have not been promptly given, and (b) such duties cannot be levied only on products of specific producers which supply the area in question.16.4 where two or more countries have reached under the provisions of paragraph 8(a) of article xxiv of gatt 1994 such a level of integration that they have the characteristics of a single, unified market, the industry in the entire area of integration shall be taken to be the domestic industry referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.16.5 the provisions of paragraph 6 of article 15 shall be applicable to this article ARTICLE 17provisional measures17.1 provisional measures may be applied only if:(a) an investigation has been initiated in accordance with the provisions of article 11, a public notice has been given to that effect and interested members and interested parties have been given adequate opportunities to submit information and make comments;(b) a preliminary affirmative determination has been made that a subsidy exists and that there is injury to a domestic industry caused by subsidized imports; and(c) the authorities concerned judge such measures necessary to prevent injury being caused during the investigation.17.2 provisional measures may take the form of provisional countervailing duties guaranteed by cash deposits or bonds equal to the amount of the provisionally calculated amount of subsidization.17.3 provisional measures shall not be applied sooner than 60 days from the date of initiation of the investigation.17.4 the application of provisional measures shall be limited to as short a period as possible, not exceeding four months.17.5 the relevant provisions of article 19 shall be followed in the application of provisional measures ARTICLE 18undertakings18.1 proceedings may[120] be suspended or terminated without the imposition of provisional measures or countervailing duties upon receipt of satisfactory voluntary undertakings under which:(a) the government of the exporting member agrees to eliminate or limit the subsidy or take other measures concerning its effects; or(b) the exporter agrees to revise its prices so that the investigating authorities are satisfied that the injurious effect of the subsidy is eliminated. price increases under such undertakings shall not be higher than necessary to eliminate the amount of the subsidy. it is desirable that the price increases be less than the amount of the subsidy if such increases would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.18.2 undertakings shall not be sought or accepted unless the authorities of the importing member have made a preliminary affirmative determination of subsidization and injury caused by such subsidization and, in case of undertakings from exporters, have obtained the consent of the exporting member.18.3 undertakings offered need not be accepted if the authorities of the importing member consider their acceptance impractical, for example if the number of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for other reasons, including reasons of general policy. should the case arise and where practicable, the authorities shall provide to the exporter the reasons which have led them to consider acceptance of an undertaking as inappropriate, and shall, to the extent possible, give the exporter an opportunity to make comments thereon.18.4 if an undertaking is accepted, the investigation of subsidization and injury shall nevertheless be completed if the exporting member so desires or the importing member so decides. in such a case, if a negative determination of subsidization or injury is made, the undertaking shall automatically lapse, except in cases where such a determination is due in large part to the existence of an undertaking. in such cases, the authorities concerned may require that an undertaking be maintained for a reasonable period consistent with the provisions of this agreement. in the event that an affirmative determination of subsidization and injury is made, the undertaking shall continue consistent with its terms and the provisions of this agreement.18.5 price undertakings may be suggested by the authorities of the importing member, but no exporter shall be forced to enter into such undertakings. the fact that governments or exporters do not offer such undertakings, or do not accept an invitation to do so, shall in no way prejudice the consideration of the case. however, the authorities are free to determine that a threat of injury is more likely to be realized if the subsidized imports continue.18.6 authorities of an importing member may require any government or exporter from whom an undertaking has been accepted to provide periodically information relevant to the fulfilment of such an undertaking, and to permit verification of pertinent data. in case of violation of an undertaking, the authorities of the importing member may take, under this agreement in conformity with its provisions, expeditious actions which may constitute immediate application of provisional measures using the best information available. in such cases, definitive duties may be levied in accordance with this agreement on products entered for consumption not more than 90 days before the application of such provisional measures, except that any such retroactive assessment shall not apply to imports entered before the violation of the undertaking ARTICLE 19imposition and collection of countervailing duties19.1 if, after reasonable efforts have been made to complete consultations, a member makes a final determination of the existence and amount of the subsidy and that, through the effects of the subsidy, the subsidized imports are causing injury, it may impose a countervailing duty in accordance with the provisions of this article unless the subsidy or subsidies are withdrawn.19.2 the decision whether or not to impose a countervailing duty in cases where all requirements for the imposition have been fulfilled, and the decision whether the amount of the countervailing duty to be imposed shall be the full amount of the subsidy or less, are decisions to be made by the authorities of the importing member. it is desirable that the imposition should be permissive in the territory of all members, that the duty should be less than the total amount of the subsidy if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry, and that procedures should be established which would allow the authorities concerned to take due account of representations made by domestic interested parties[121] whose interests might be adversely affected by the imposition of a countervailing duty.19.3 when a countervailing duty is imposed in respect of any product, such countervailing duty shall be levied, in the appropriate amounts in each case, on a non-discriminatory basis on imports of such product from all sources found to be subsidized and causing injury, except as to imports from those sources which have renounced any subsidies in question or from which undertakings under the terms of this agreement have been accepted. any exporter whose exports are subject to a definitive countervailing duty but who was not actually investigated for reasons other than a refusal to cooperate, shall be entitled to an expedited review in order that the investigating authorities promptly establish an individual countervailing duty rate for that exporter.19.4 no countervailing duty shall be levied[122] on any imported product in excess of the amount of the subsidy found to exist, calculated in terms of subsidization per unit of the subsidized and exported product ARTICLE 20retroactivity20.1 provisional measures and countervailing duties shall only be applied to products which enter for consumption after the time when the decision under paragraph 1 of article 17 and paragraph 1 of article 19, respectively, enters into force, subject to the exceptions set out in this article.20.2 where a final determination of injury (but not of a threat thereof or of a material retardation of the establishment of an industry) is made or, in the case of a final determination of a threat of injury, where the effect of the subsidized imports would, in the absence of the provisional measures, have led to a determination of injury, countervailing duties may be levied retroactively for the period for which provisional measures, if any, have been applied.20.3 if the definitive countervailing duty is higher than the amount guaranteed by the cash deposit or bond, the difference shall not be collected. if the definitive duty is less than the amount guaranteed by the cash deposit or bond, the excess amount shall be reimbursed or the bond released in an expeditious manner.20.4 except as provided in paragraph 2, where a determination of threat of injury or material retardation is made (but no injury has yet occurred) a definitive countervailing duty may be imposed only from the date of the determination of threat of injury or material retardation, and any cash deposit made during the period of the application of provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds released in an expeditious manner.20.5 where a final determination is negative, any cash deposit made during the period of the application of provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds released in an expeditious manner.20.6 in critical circumstances where for the subsidized product in question the authorities find that injury which is difficult to repair is caused by massive imports in a relatively short period of a product benefiting from subsidies paid or bestowed inconsistently with the provisions of gatt 1994 and of this agreement and where it is deemed necessary, in order to preclude the recurrence of such injury, to assess countervailing duties retroactively on those imports, the definitive countervailing duties may be assessed on imports which were entered for consumption not more than 90 days prior to the date of application of provisional measures ARTICLE 21duration and review of countervailing duties and undertakings21.1 a countervailing duty shall remain in force only as long as and to the extent necessary to counteract subsidization which is causing injury.21.2 the authorities shall review the need for the continued imposition of the duty, where warranted, on their own initiative or, provided that a reasonable period of time has elapsed since the imposition of the definitive countervailing duty, upon request by any interested party which submits positive information substantiating the need for a review. interested parties shall have the right to request the authorities to examine whether the continued imposition of the duty is necessary to offset subsidization, whether the injury would be likely to continue or recur if the duty were removed or varied, or both. if, as a result of the review under this paragraph, the authorities determine that the countervailing duty is no longer warranted, it shall be terminated immediately.21.3 notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, any definitive countervailing duty shall be terminated on a date not later than five years from its imposition (or from the date of the most recent review under paragraph 2 if that review has covered both subsidization and injury, or under this paragraph), unless the authorities determine, in a review initiated before that date on their own initiative or upon a duly substantiated request made by or on behalf of the domestic industry within a reasonable period of time prior to that date, that the expiry of the duty would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of subsidization and injury.[123] the duty may remain in force pending the outcome of such a review.21.4 the provisions of article 12 regarding evidence and procedure shall apply to any review carried out under this article. any such review shall be carried out expeditiously and shall normally be concluded within 12 months of the date of initiation of the review.21.5 the provisions of this article shall apply mutatis mutandis to undertakings accepted under article 18 ARTICLE 22public notice and explanation of determinations22.1 when the authorities are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to article 11, the member or members the products of which are subject to such investigation and other interested parties known to the investigating authorities to have an interest therein shall be notified and a public notice shall be given.22.2 a public notice of the initiation of an investigation shall contain, or otherwise make available through a separate report[124], adequate information on the following:(i) the name of the exporting country or countries and the product involved;(ii) the date of initiation of the investigation;(iii) a description of the subsidy practice or practices to be investigated;(iv) a summary of the factors on which the allegation of injury is based;(v) the address to which representations by interested members and interested parties should be directed; and(vi) the time-limits allowed to interested members and interested parties for making their views known.22.3 public notice shall be given of any preliminary or final determination, whether affirmative or negative, of any decision to accept an undertaking pursuant to article 18, of the termination of such an undertaking, and of the termination of a definitive countervailing duty. each such notice shall set forth, or otherwise make available through a separate report, in sufficient detail the findings and conclusions reached on all issues of fact and law considered material by the investigating authorities. all such notices and reports shall be forwarded to the member or members the products of which are subject to such determination or undertaking and to other interested parties known to have an interest therein.22.4 a public notice of the imposition of provisional measures shall set forth, or otherwise make available through a separate report, sufficiently detailed explanations for the preliminary determinations on the existence of a subsidy and injury and shall refer to the matters of fact and law which have led to arguments being accepted or rejected. such a notice or report shall, due regard being paid to the requirement for the protection of confidential information, contain in particular:(i) the names of the suppliers or, when this is impracticable, the supplying countries involved;(ii) a description of the product which is sufficient for customs purposes;(iii) the amount of subsidy established and the basis on which the existence of a subsidy has been determined;(iv) considerations relevant to the injury determination as set out in article 15;(v) the main reasons leading to the determination.22.5 a public notice of conclusion or suspension of an investigation in the case of an affirmative determination providing for the imposition of a definitive duty or the acceptance of an undertaking shall contain, or otherwise make available through a separate report, all relevant information on the matters of fact and law and reasons which have led to the imposition of final measures or the acceptance of an undertaking, due regard being paid to the requirement for the protection of confidential information. in particular, the notice or report shall contain the information described in paragraph 4, as well as the reasons for the acceptance or rejection of relevant arguments or claims made by interested members and by the exporters and importers.22.6 a public notice of the termination or suspension of an investigation following the acceptance of an undertaking pursuant to article 18 shall include, or otherwise make available through a separate report, the non-confidential part of this undertaking.22.7 the provisions of this article shall apply mutatis mutandis to the initiation and completion of reviews pursuant to article 21 and to decisions under article 20 to apply duties retroactively ARTICLE 23judicial revieweach member whose national legislation contains provisions on countervailing duty measures shall maintain judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures for the purpose, inter alia, of the prompt review of administrative actions relating to final determinations and reviews of determinations within the meaning of article 21. such tribunals or procedures shall be independent of the authorities responsible for the determination or review in question, and shall provide all interested parties who participated in the administrative proceeding and are directly and individually affected by the administrative actions with access to review.part vi: institutions ARTICLE 24committee on subsidies and countervailing measures and subsidiary bodies24.1 there is hereby established a committee on subsidies and countervailing measures composed of representatives from each of the members. the committee shall elect its own chairman and shall meet not less than twice a year and otherwise as envisaged by relevant provisions of this agreement at the request of any member. the committee shall carry out responsibilities as assigned to it under this agreement or by the members and it shall afford members the opportunity of consulting on any matter relating to the operation of the agreement or the furtherance of its objectives. the wto secretariat shall act as the secretariat to the committee.24.2 the committee may set up subsidiary bodies as appropriate.24.3 the committee shall establish a permanent group of experts composed of five independent persons, highly qualified in the fields of subsidies and trade relations. the experts will be elected by the committee and one of them will be replaced every year. the pge may be requested to assist a panel, as provided for in paragraph 5 of article 4. the committee may also seek an advisory opinion on the existence and nature of any subsidy.24.4 the pge may be consulted by any member and may give advisory opinions on the nature of any subsidy proposed to be introduced or currently maintained by that member. such advisory opinions will be confidential and may not be invoked in proceedings under article 7.24.5 in carrying out their functions, the committee and any subsidiary bodies may consult with and seek information from any source they deem appropriate. however, before the committee or a subsidiary body seeks such information from a source within the jurisdiction of a member, it shall inform the member involved.part vii: notification and surveillance ARTICLE 25notifications25.1 members agree that, without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1 of article xvi of gatt 1994, their notifications of subsidies shall be submitted not later than 30 june of each year and shall conform to the provisions of paragraphs 2 through 6.25.2 members shall notify any subsidy as defined in paragraph 1 of article 1, which is specific within the meaning of article 2, granted or maintained within their territories.25.3 the content of notifications should be sufficiently specific to enable other members to evaluate the trade effects and to understand the operation of notified subsidy programmes. in this connection, and without prejudice to the contents and form of the questionnaire on subsidies[125], members shall ensure that their notifications contain the following information:(i) form of a subsidy (i.e. grant, loan, tax concession, etc.);(ii) subsidy per unit or, in cases where this is not possible, the total amount or the annual amount budgeted for that subsidy (indicating, if possible, the average subsidy per unit in the previous year);(iii) policy objective and/or purpose of a subsidy;(iv) duration of a subsidy and/or any other time-limits attached to it;(v) statistical data permitting an assessment of the trade effects of a subsidy.25.4 where specific points in paragraph 3 have not been addressed in a notification, an explanation shall be provided in the notification itself.25.5 if subsidies are granted to specific products or sectors, the notifications should be organized by product or sector.25.6 members which consider that there are no measures in their territories requiring notification under paragraph 1 of article xvi of gatt 1994 and this agreement shall so inform the secretariat in writing.25.7 members recognize that notification of a measure does not prejudge either its legal status under gatt 1994 and this agreement, the effects under this agreement, or the nature of the measure itself.25.8 any member may, at any time, make a written request for information on the nature and extent of any subsidy granted or maintained by another member (including any subsidy referred to in part iv), or for an explanation of the reasons for which a specific measure has been considered as not subject to the requirement of notification.25.9 members so requested shall provide such information as quickly as possible and in a comprehensive manner, and shall be ready, upon request, to provide additional information to the requesting member. in particular, they shall provide sufficient details to enable the other member to assess their compliance with the terms of this agreement. any member which considers that such information has not been provided may bring the matter to the attention of the committee.25.10 any member which considers that any measure of another member having the effects of a subsidy has not been notified in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of article xvi of gatt 1994 and this article may bring the matter to the attention of such other member. if the alleged subsidy is not thereafter notified promptly, such member may itself bring the alleged subsidy in question to the notice of the committee.25.11 members shall report without delay to the committee all preliminary or final actions taken with respect to countervailing duties. such reports shall be available in the secretariat for inspection by other members. members shall also submit, on a semi-annual basis, reports on any countervailing duty actions taken within the preceding six months. the semi-annual reports shall be submitted on an agreed standard form.25.12 each member shall notify the committee (a) which of its authorities are competent to initiate and conduct investigations referred to in article 11 and (b) its domestic procedures governing the initiation and conduct of such investigations ARTICLE 26surveillance26.1 the committee shall examine new and full notifications submitted under paragraph 1 of article xvi of gatt 1994 and paragraph 1 of article 25 of this agreement at special sessions held every third year. notifications submitted in the intervening years (updating notifications) shall be examined at each regular meeting of the committee.26.2 the committee shall examine reports submitted under paragraph 11 of article 25 at each regular meeting of the committee.part viii: developing country members ARTICLE 27special and differential treatment of developing country members27.1 members recognize that subsidies may play an important role in economic development programmes of developing country members.27.2 the prohibition of paragraph 1(a) of article 3 shall not apply to:(a) developing country members referred to in annex vii.(b) other developing country members for a period of eight years from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, subject to compliance with the provisions in paragraph 4.27.3 the prohibition of paragraph 1(b) of article 3 shall not apply to developing country members for a period of five years, and shall not apply to least developed country members for a period of eight years, from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement.27.4 any developing country member referred to in paragraph 2(b) shall phase out its export subsidies within the eight-year period, preferably in a progressive manner. however, a developing country member shall not increase the level of its export subsidies[126], and shall eliminate them within a period shorter than that provided for in this paragraph when the use of such export subsidies is inconsistent with its development needs. if a developing country member deems it necessary to apply such subsidies beyond the 8-year period, it shall not later than one year before the expiry of this period enter into consultation with the committee, which will determine whether an extension of this period is justified, after examining all the relevant economic, financial and development needs of the developing country member in question. if the committee determines that the extension is justified, the developing country member concerned shall hold annual consultations with the committee to determine the necessity of maintaining the subsidies. if no such determination is made by the committee, the developing country member shall phase out the remaining export subsidies within two years from the end of the last authorized period.27.5 a developing country member which has reached export competitiveness in any given product shall phase out its export subsidies for such product(s) over a period of two years. however, for a developing country member which is referred to in annex vii and which has reached export competitiveness in one or more products, export subsidies on such products shall be gradually phased out over a period of eight years.27.6 export competitiveness in a product exists if a developing country member's exports of that product have reached a share of at least 3.25 per cent in world trade of that product for two consecutive calendar years. export competitiveness shall exist either (a) on the basis of notification by the developing country member having reached export competitiveness, or (b) on the basis of a computation undertaken by the secretariat at the request of any member. for the purpose of this paragraph, a product is defined as a section heading of the harmonized system nomenclature. the committee shall review the operation of this provision five years from the date of the entry into force of the wto agreement.27.7 the provisions of article 4 shall not apply to a developing country member in the case of export subsidies which are in conformity with the provisions of paragraphs 2 through 5. the relevant provisions in such a case shall be those of article 7.27.8 there shall be no presumption in terms of paragraph 1 of article 6 that a subsidy granted by a developing country member results in serious prejudice, as defined in this agreement. such serious prejudice, where applicable under the terms of paragraph 9, shall be demonstrated by positive evidence, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3 through 8 of article 6.27.9 regarding actionable subsidies granted or maintained by a developing country member other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of article 6, action may not be authorized or taken under article 7 unless nullification or impairment of tariff concessions or other obligations under gatt 1994 is found to exist as a result of such a subsidy, in such a way as to displace or impede imports of a like product of another member into the market of the subsidizing developing country member or unless injury to a domestic industry in the market of an importing member occurs.27.10 any countervailing duty investigation of a product originating in a developing country member shall be terminated as soon as the authorities concerned determine that:(a) the overall level of subsidies granted upon the product in question does not exceed 2 per cent of its value calculated on a per unit basis; or(b) the volume of the subsidized imports represents less than 4 per cent of the total imports of the like product in the importing member, unless imports from developing country members whose individual shares of total imports represent less than 4 per cent collectively account for more than 9 per cent of the total imports of the like product in the importing member.27.11 for those developing country members within the scope of paragraph 2(b) which have eliminated export subsidies prior to the expiry of the period of eight years from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, and for those developing country members referred to in annex vii, the number in paragraph 10(a) shall be 3 per cent rather than 2 per cent. this provision shall apply from the date that the elimination of export subsidies is notified to the committee, and for so long as export subsidies are not granted by the notifying developing country member. this provision shall expire eight years from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement.27.12 the provisions of paragraphs 10 and 11 shall govern any determination of de minimis under paragraph 3 of article 15.27.13 the provisions of part iii shall not apply to direct forgiveness of debts, subsidies to cover social costs, in whatever form, including relinquishment of government revenue and other transfer of liabilities when such subsidies are granted within and directly linked to a privatization programme of a developing country member, provided that both such programme and the subsidies involved are granted for a limited period and notified to the committee and that the programme results in eventual privatization of the enterprise concerned.27.14 the committee shall, upon request by an interested member, undertake a review of a specific export subsidy practice of a developing country member to examine whether the practice is in conformity with its development needs.27.15 the committee shall, upon request by an interested developing country member, undertake a review of a specific countervailing measure to examine whether it is consistent with the provisions of paragraphs 10 and 11 as applicable to the developing country member in question.part ix: transitional arrangements ARTICLE 28existing programmes28.1 subsidy programmes which have been established within the territory of any member before the date on which such a member signed the wto agreement and which are inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement shall be:(a) notified to the committee not later than 90 days after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement for such member; and(b) brought into conformity with the provisions of this agreement within three years of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement for such member and until then shall not be subject to part ii.28.2 no member shall extend the scope of any such programme, nor shall such a programme be renewed upon its expiry ARTICLE 29transformation into a market economy29.1 members in the process of transformation from a centrally-planned into a market, free-enterprise economy may apply programmes and measures necessary for such a transformation.29.2 for such members, subsidy programmes falling within the scope of article 3, and notified according to paragraph 3, shall be phased out or brought into conformity with article 3 within a period of seven years from the date of entry into force of the wto agreement. in such a case, article 4 shall not apply. in addition during the same period:(a) subsidy programmes falling within the scope of paragraph 1(d) of article 6 shall not be actionable under article 7;(b) with respect to other actionable subsidies, the provisions of paragraph 9 of article 27 shall apply.29.3 subsidy programmes falling within the scope of article 3 shall be notified to the committee by the earliest practicable date after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement. further notifications of such subsidies may be made up to two years after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement.29.4 in exceptional circumstances members referred to in paragraph 1 may be given departures from their notified programmes and measures and their time-frame by the committee if such departures are deemed necessary for the process of transformation.part x: dispute settlement ARTICLE 30the provisions of articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1994 as elaborated and applied by the dispute settlement understanding shall apply to consultations and the settlement of disputes under this agreement, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.part xi: final provisions ARTICLE 31provisional applicationthe provisions of paragraph 1 of article 6 and the provisions of article 8 and article 9 shall apply for a period of five years, beginning with the date of entry into force of the wto agreement. not later than 180 days before the end of this period, the committee shall review the operation of those provisions, with a view to determining whether to extend their application, either as presently drafted or in a modified form, for a further period ARTICLE 32other final provisions32.1 no specific action against a subsidy of another member can be taken except in accordance with the provisions of gatt 1994, as interpreted by this agreement.[127]32.2 reservations may not be entered in respect of any of the provisions of this agreement without the consent of the other members.32.3 subject to paragraph 4, the provisions of this agreement shall apply to investigations, and reviews of existing measures, initiated pursuant to applications which have been made on or after the date of entry into force for a member of the wto agreement.32.4 for the purposes of paragraph 3 of article 21, existing countervailing measures shall be deemed to be imposed on a date not later than the date of entry into force for a member of the wto agreement, except in cases in which the domestic legislation of a member in force at that date already included a clause of the type provided for in that paragraph.32.5 each member shall take all necessary steps, of a general or particular character, to ensure, not later than the date of entry into force of the wto agreement for it, the conformity of its laws, regulations and administrative procedures with the provisions of this agreement as they may apply to the member in question.32.6 each member shall inform the committee of any changes in its laws and regulations relevant to this agreement and in the administration of such laws and regulations.32.7 the committee shall review annually the implementation and operation of this agreement, taking into account the objectives thereof. the committee shall inform annually the council for trade in goods of developments during the period covered by such reviews.32.8 the annexes to this agreement constitute an integral part thereof ANNEX iillustrative list of export subsidies(a) the provision by governments of direct subsidies to a firm or an industry contingent upon export performance.(b) currency retention schemes or any similar practices which involve a bonus on exports.(c) internal transport and freight charges on export shipments, provided or mandated by governments, on terms more favourable than for domestic shipments.(d) the provision by governments or their agencies either directly or indirectly through government-mandated schemes, of imported or domestic products or services for use in the production of exported goods, on terms or conditions more favourable than for provision of like or directly competitive products or services for use in the production of goods for domestic consumption, if (in the case of products) such terms or conditions are more favourable than those commercially available[128] on world markets to their exporters.(e) the full or partial exemption remission, or deferral specifically related to exports, of direct taxes[129] or social welfare charges paid or payable by industrial or commercial enterprises.[130](f) the allowance of special deductions directly related to exports or export performance, over and above those granted in respect to production for domestic consumption, in the calculation of the base on which direct taxes are charged.(g) the exemption or remission, in respect of the production and distribution of exported products, of indirect taxes58 in excess of those levied in respect of the production and distribution of like products when sold for domestic consumption.(h) the exemption, remission or deferral of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes58 on goods or services used in the production of exported products in excess of the exemption, remission or deferral of like prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes on goods or services used in the production of like products when sold for domestic consumption; provided, however, that prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes may be exempted, remitted or deferred on exported products even when not exempted, remitted or deferred on like products when sold for domestic consumption, if the prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes are levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product (making normal allowance for waste).[131] this item shall be interpreted in accordance with the guidelines on consumption of inputs in the production process contained in annex ii.(i) the remission or drawback of import charges58 in excess of those levied on imported inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product (making normal allowance for waste); provided, however, that in particular cases a firm may use a quantity of home market inputs equal to, and having the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs as a substitute for them in order to benefit from this provision if the import and the corresponding export operations both occur within a reasonable time period, not to exceed two years. this item shall be interpreted in accordance with the guidelines on consumption of inputs in the production process contained in annex ii and the guidelines in the determination of substitution drawback systems as export subsidies contained in annex iii.(j) the provision by governments (or special institutions controlled by governments) of export credit guarantee or insurance programmes, of insurance or guarantee programmes against increases in the cost of exported products or of exchange risk programmes, at premium rates which are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the programmes.(k) the grant by governments (or special institutions controlled by and/or acting under the authority of governments) of export credits at rates below those which they actually have to pay for the funds so employed (or would have to pay if they borrowed on international capital markets in order to obtain funds of the same maturity and other credit terms and denominated in the same currency as the export credit), or the payment by them of all or part of the costs incurred by exporters or financial institutions in obtaining credits, in so far as they are used to secure a material advantage in the field of export credit terms.provided, however, that if a member is a party to an international undertaking on official export credits to which at least twelve original members to this agreement are parties as of 1 january 1979 (or a successor undertaking which has been adopted by those original members), or if in practice a member applies the interest rates provisions of the relevant undertaking, an export credit practice which is in conformity with those provisions shall not be considered an export subsidy prohibited by this agreement.(l) any other charge on the public account constituting an export subsidy in the sense of article xvi of gatt 1994 ANNEX iiguidelines on consumption of inputs inthe production process[132]i1. indirect tax rebate schemes can allow for exemption, remission or deferral of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product (making normal allowance for waste). similarly, drawback schemes can allow for the remission or drawback of import charges levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product (making normal allowance for waste).2. the illustrative list of export subsidies in annex i of this agreement makes reference to the term "inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product" in paragraphs (h) and (i). pursuant to paragraph (h), indirect tax rebate schemes can constitute an export subsidy to the extent that they result in exemption, remission or deferral of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes in excess of the amount of such taxes actually levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product. pursuant to paragraph (i), drawback schemes can constitute an export subsidy to the extent that they result in a remission or drawback of import charges in excess of those actually levied on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product. both paragraphs stipulate that normal allowance for waste must be made in findings regarding consumption of inputs in the production of the exported product. paragraph (i) also provides for substitution, where appropriate.iiin examining whether inputs are consumed in the production of the exported product, as part of a countervailing duty investigation pursuant to this agreement, investigating authorities should proceed on the following basis:1. where it is alleged that an indirect tax rebate scheme, or a drawback scheme, conveys a subsidy by reason of over-rebate or excess drawback of indirect taxes or import charges on inputs consumed in the production of the exported product, the investigating authorities should first determine whether the government of the exporting member has in place and applies a system or procedure to confirm which inputs are consumed in the production of the exported product and in what amounts. where such a system or procedure is determined to be applied, the investigating authorities should then examine the system or procedure to see whether it is reasonable, effective for the purpose intended, and based on generally accepted commercial practices in the country of export. the investigating authorities may deem it necessary to carry out, in accordance with paragraph 6 of article 12, certain practical tests in order to verify information or to satisfy themselves that the system or procedure is being effectively applied.2. where there is no such system or procedure, where it is not reasonable, or where it is instituted and considered reasonable but is found not to be applied or not to be applied effectively, a further examination by the exporting member based on the actual inputs involved would need to be carried out in the context of determining whether an excess payment occurred. if the investigating authorities deemed it necessary, a further examination would be carried out in accordance with paragraph 1.3. investigating authorities should treat inputs as physically incorporated if such inputs are used in the production process and are physically present in the product exported. the members note that an input need not be present in the final product in the same form in which it entered the production process.4. in determining the amount of a particular input that is consumed in the production of the exported product, a "normal allowance for waste" should be taken into account, and such waste should be treated as consumed in the production of the exported product. the term "waste" refers to that portion of a given input which does not serve an independent function in the production process, is not consumed in the production of the exported product (for reasons such as inefficiencies) and is not recovered, used or sold by the same manufacturer.5. the investigating authority's determination of whether the claimed allowance for waste is "normal" should take into account the production process, the average experience of the industry in the country of export, and other technical factors, as appropriate. the investigating authority should bear in mind that an important question is whether the authorities in the exporting member have reasonably calculated the amount of waste, when such an amount is intended to be included in the tax or duty rebate or remission ANNEX iiiguidelines in the determination of substitution drawback systems as export subsidiesidrawback systems can allow for the refund or drawback of import charges on inputs which are consumed in the production process of another product and where the export of this latter product contains domestic inputs having the same quality and characteristics as those substituted for the imported inputs. pursuant to paragraph (i) of the illustrative list of export subsidies in annex i, substitution drawback systems can constitute an export subsidy to the extent that they result in an excess drawback of the import charges levied initially on the imported inputs for which drawback is being claimed.iiin examining any substitution drawback system as part of a countervailing duty investigation pursuant to this agreement, investigating authorities should proceed on the following basis:1. paragraph (i) of the illustrative list stipulates that home market inputs may be substituted for imported inputs in the production of a product for export provided such inputs are equal in quantity to, and have the same quality and characteristics as, the imported inputs being substituted. the existence of a verification system or procedure is important because it enables the government of the exporting member to ensure and demonstrate that the quantity of inputs for which drawback is claimed does not exceed the quantity of similar products exported, in whatever form, and that there is not drawback of import charges in excess of those originally levied on the imported inputs in question.2. where it is alleged that a substitution drawback system conveys a subsidy, the investigating authorities should first proceed to determine whether the government of the exporting member has in place and applies a verification system or procedure. where such a system or procedure is determined to be applied, the investigating authorities should then examine the verification procedures to see whether they are reasonable, effective for the purpose intended, and based on generally accepted commercial practices in the country of export. to the extent that the procedures are determined to meet this test and are effectively applied, no subsidy should be presumed to exist. it may be deemed necessary by the investigating authorities to carry out, in accordance with paragraph 6 of article 12, certain practical tests in order to verify information or to satisfy themselves that the verification procedures are being effectively applied.3. where there are no verification procedures, where they are not reasonable, or where such procedures are instituted and considered reasonable but are found not to be actually applied or not applied effectively, there may be a subsidy. in such cases a further examination by the exporting member based on the actual transactions involved would need to be carried out to determine whether an excess payment occurred. if the investigating authorities deemed it necessary, a further examination would be carried out in accordance with paragraph 2.4. the existence of a substitution drawback provision under which exporters are allowed to select particular import shipments on which drawback is claimed should not of itself be considered to convey a subsidy.5. an excess drawback of import charges in the sense of paragraph (i) would be deemed to exist where governments paid interest on any monies refunded under their drawback schemes, to the extent of the interest actually paid or payable ANNEX ivcalculation of the total ad valorem subsidization (paragraph 1(a) of article 6)[133]1. any calculation of the amount of a subsidy for the purpose of paragraph 1(a) of article 6 shall be done in terms of the cost to the granting government.2. except as provided in paragraphs 3 through 5, in determining whether the overall rate of subsidization exceeds 5 per cent of the value of the product, the value of the product shall be calculated as the total value of the recipient firm's[134] sales in the most recent 12-month period, for which sales data is available, preceding the period in which the subsidy is granted.[135]3. where the subsidy is tied to the production or sale of a given product, the value of the product shall be calculated as the total value of the recipient firm's sales of that product in the most recent 12-month period, for which sales data is available, preceding the period in which the subsidy is granted.4. where the recipient firm is in a start-up situation, serious prejudice shall be deemed to exist if the overall rate of subsidization exceeds 15 per cent of the total funds invested. for purposes of this paragraph, a start-up period will not extend beyond the first year of production.[136]5. where the recipient firm is located in an inflationary economy country, the value of the product shall be calculated as the recipient firm's total sales (or sales of the relevant product, if the subsidy is tied) in the preceding calendar year indexed by the rate of inflation experienced in the 12 months preceding the month in which the subsidy is to be given.6. in determining the overall rate of subsidization in a given year, subsidies given under different programmes and by different authorities in the territory of a member shall be aggregated.7. subsidies granted prior to the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, the benefits of which are allocated to future production, shall be included in the overall rate of subsidization.8. subsidies which are non-actionable under relevant provisions of this agreement shall not be included in the calculation of the amount of a subsidy for the purpose of paragraph 1(a) of article 6 ANNEX vprocedures for developing information concerningserious prejudice1. every member shall cooperate in the development of evidence to be examined by a panel in procedures under paragraphs 4 through 6 of article 7. the parties to the dispute and any third-country member concerned shall notify to the dsb, as soon as the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 7 have been invoked, the organization responsible for administration of this provision within its territory and the procedures to be used to comply with requests for information.2. in cases where matters are referred to the dsb under paragraph 4 of article 7, the dsb shall, upon request, initiate the procedure to obtain such information from the government of the subsidizing member as necessary to establish the existence and amount of subsidization, the value of total sales of the subsidized firms, as well as information necessary to analyze the adverse effects caused by the subsidized product.[137] this process may include, where appropriate, presentation of questions to the government of the subsidizing member and of the complaining member to collect information, as well as to clarify and obtain elaboration of information available to the parties to a dispute through the notification procedures set forth in part vii.[138]3. in the case of effects in third-country markets, a party to a dispute may collect information, including through the use of questions to the government of the third-country member, necessary to analyse adverse effects, which is not otherwise reasonably available from the complaining member or the subsidizing member. this requirement should be administered in such a way as not to impose an unreasonable burden on the third-country member. in particular, such a member is not expected to make a market or price analysis specially for that purpose. the information to be supplied is that which is already available or can be readily obtained by this member (e.g. most recent statistics which have already been gathered by relevant statistical services but which have not yet been published, customs data concerning imports and declared values of the products concerned, etc.). however, if a party to a dispute undertakes a detailed market analysis at its own expense, the task of the person or firm conducting such an analysis shall be facilitated by the authorities of the third-country member and such a person or firm shall be given access to all information which is not normally maintained confidential by the government.4. the dsb shall designate a representative to serve the function of facilitating the information-gathering process. the sole purpose of the representative shall be to ensure the timely development of the information necessary to facilitate expeditious subsequent multilateral review of the dispute. in particular, the representative may suggest ways to most efficiently solicit necessary information as well as encourage the cooperation of the parties.5. the information-gathering process outlined in paragraphs 2 through 4 shall be completed within 60 days of the date on which the matter has been referred to the dsb under paragraph 4 of article 7. the information obtained during this process shall be submitted to the panel established by the dsb in accordance with the provisions of part x. this information should include, inter alia, data concerning the amount of the subsidy in question (and, where appropriate, the value of total sales of the subsidized firms), prices of the subsidized product, prices of the non-subsidized product, prices of other suppliers to the market, changes in the supply of the subsidized product to the market in question and changes in market shares. it should also include rebuttal evidence, as well as such supplemental information as the panel deems relevant in the course of reaching its conclusions.6. if the subsidizing and/or third-country member fail to cooperate in the information-gathering process, the complaining member will present its case of serious prejudice, based on evidence available to it, together with facts and circumstances of the non-cooperation of the subsidizing and/or third-country member. where information is unavailable due to non-cooperation by the subsidizing and/or third-country member, the panel may complete the record as necessary relying on best information otherwise available.7. in making its determination, the panel should draw adverse inferences from instances of non-cooperation by any party involved in the information-gathering process.8. in making a determination to use either best information available or adverse inferences, the panel shall consider the advice of the dsb representative nominated under paragraph 4 as to the reasonableness of any requests for information and the efforts made by parties to comply with these requests in a cooperative and timely manner.9. nothing in the information-gathering process shall limit the ability of the panel to seek such additional information it deems essential to a proper resolution to the dispute, and which was not adequately sought or developed during that process. however, ordinarily the panel should not request additional information to complete the record where the information would support a particular party's position and the absence of that information in the record is the result of unreasonable non-cooperation by that party in the information-gathering process ANNEX viprocedures for on-the-spot investigations pursuant to paragraph 6 of article 121. upon initiation of an investigation, the authorities of the exporting member and the firms known to be concerned should be informed of the intention to carry out on-the-spot investigations.2. if in exceptional circumstances it is intended to include non-governmental experts in the investigating team, the firms and the authorities of the exporting member should be so informed. such non-governmental experts should be subject to effective sanctions for breach of confidentiality requirements.3. it should be standard practice to obtain explicit agreement of the firms concerned in

to improve and strengthen the international trading system based on gatt 1994;recognizing the need to clarify and reinforce the disciplines of gatt 1994, and specifically those of its article xix (emergency action on imports of particular products), to re-establish multilateral control over safeguards and eliminate measures that escape such control;recognizing the importance of structural adjustment and the need to enhance rather than limit competition in international markets; andrecognizing further that, for these purposes, a comprehensive agreement, applicable to all members and based on the basic principles of gatt 1994, is called for;hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1general provisionthis agreement establishes rules for the application of safeguard measures which shall be understood to mean those measures provided for in article xix of gatt 1994 ARTICLE 2conditions1. a member[140] may apply a safeguard measure to a product only if that member has determined, pursuant to the provisions set out below, that such product is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive products.2. safeguard measures shall be applied to a product being imported irrespective of its source ARTICLE 3investigation1. a member may apply a safeguard measure only following an investigation by the competent authorities of that member pursuant to procedures previously established and made public in consonance with article x of gatt 1994. this investigation shall include reasonable public notice to all interested parties and public hearings or other appropriate means in which importers, exporters and other interested parties could present evidence and their views, including the opportunity to respond to the presentations of other parties and to submit their views, inter alia, as to whether or not the application of a safeguard measure would be in the public interest. the competent authorities shall publish a report setting forth their findings and reasoned conclusions reached on all pertinent issues of fact and law.2. any information which is by nature confidential or which is provided on a confidential basis shall, upon cause being shown, be treated as such by the competent authorities. such information shall not be disclosed without permission of the party submitting it. parties providing confidential information may be requested to furnish non-confidential summaries thereof or, if such parties indicate that such information cannot be summarized, the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. however, if the competent authorities find that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the party concerned is either unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summary form, the authorities may disregard such information unless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the information is correct ARTICLE 4determination of serious injury or threat thereof1. for the purposes of this agreement:(a) "serious injury" shall be understood to mean a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry;(b) "threat of serious injury" shall be understood to mean serious injury that is clearly imminent, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2. a determination of the existence of a threat of serious injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility; and(c) in determining injury or threat thereof, a "domestic industry" shall be understood to mean the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive products operating within the territory of a member, or those whose collective output of the like or directly competitive products constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of those products.2. (a) in the investigation to determine whether increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry under the terms of this agreement, the competent authorities shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of that industry, in particular, the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports, changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilization, profits and losses, and employment.(b) the determination referred to in subparagraph (a) shall not be made unless this investigation demonstrates, on the basis of objective evidence, the existence of the causal link between increased imports of the product concerned and serious injury or threat thereof. when factors other than increased imports are causing injury to the domestic industry at the same time, such injury shall not be attributed to increased imports.(c) the competent authorities shall publish promptly, in accordance with the provisions of article 3, a detailed analysis of the case under investigation as well as a demonstration of the relevance of the factors examined ARTICLE 5application of safeguard measures1. a member shall apply safeguard measures only to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. if a quantitative restriction is used, such a measure shall not reduce the quantity of imports below the level of a recent period which shall be the average of imports in the last three representative years for which statistics are available, unless clear justification is given that a different level is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury. members should choose measures most suitable for the achievement of these objectives.2. (a) in cases in which a quota is allocated among supplying countries, the member applying the restrictions may seek agreement with respect to the allocation of shares in the quota with all other members having a substantial interest in supplying the product concerned. in cases in which this method is not reasonably practicable, the member concerned shall allot to members having a substantial interest in supplying the product shares based upon the proportions, supplied by such members during a previous representative period, of the total quantity or value of imports of the product, due account being taken of any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the product.(b) a member may depart from the provisions in subparagraph (a) provided that consultations under paragraph 3 of article 12 are conducted under the auspices of the committee on safeguards provided for in paragraph 1 of article 13 and that clear demonstration is provided to the committee that (i) imports from certain members have increased in disproportionate percentage in relation to the total increase of imports of the product concerned in the representative period, (ii) the reasons for the departure from the provisions in subparagraph (a) are justified, and (iii) the conditions of such departure are equitable to all suppliers of the product concerned. the duration of any such measure shall not be extended beyond the initial period under paragraph 1 of article 7. the departure referred to above shall not be permitted in the case of threat of serious injury ARTICLE 6provisional safeguard measuresin critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, a member may take a provisional safeguard measure pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury. the duration of the provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which period the pertinent requirements of articles 2 through 7 and 12 shall be met. such measures should take the form of tariff increases to be promptly refunded if the subsequent investigation referred to in paragraph 2 of article 4 does not determine that increased imports have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. the duration of any such provisional measure shall be counted as a part of the initial period and any extension referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of article 7 ARTICLE 7duration and review of safeguard measures1. a member shall apply safeguard measures only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. the period shall not exceed four years, unless it is extended under paragraph 2.2. the period mentioned in paragraph 1 may be extended provided that the competent authorities of the importing member have determined, in conformity with the procedures set out in articles 2, 3, 4 and 5, that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting, and provided that the pertinent provisions of articles 8 and 12 are observed.3. the total period of application of a safeguard measure including the period of application of any provisional measure, the period of initial application and any extension thereof, shall not exceed eight years.4. in order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the expected duration of a safeguard measure as notified under the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 12 is over one year, the member applying the measure shall progressively liberalize it at regular intervals during the period of application. if the duration of the measure exceeds three years, the member applying such a measure shall review the situation not later than the mid-term of the measure and, if appropriate, withdraw it or increase the pace of liberalization. a measure extended under paragraph 2 shall not be more restrictive than it was at the end of the initial period, and should continue to be liberalized.5. no safeguard measure shall be applied again to the import of a product which has been subject to such a measure, taken after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, for a period of time equal to that during which such measure had been previously applied, provided that the period of non-application is at least two years.6. notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, a safeguard measure with a duration of 180 days or less may be applied again to the import of a product if:(a) at least one year has elapsed since the date of introduction of a safeguard measure on the import of that product; and(b) such a safeguard measure has not been applied on the same product more than twice in the five-year period immediately preceding the date of introduction of the measure ARTICLE 8level of concessions and other obligations1. a member proposing to apply a safeguard measure or seeking an extension of a safeguard measure shall endeavour to maintain a substantially equivalent level of concessions and other obligations to that existing under gatt 1994 between it and the exporting members which would be affected by such a measure, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 12. to achieve this objective, the members concerned may agree on any adequate means of trade compensation for the adverse effects of the measure on their trade.2. if no agreement is reached within 30 days in the consultations under paragraph 3 of article 12, then the affected exporting members shall be free, not later than 90 days after the measure is applied, to suspend, upon the expiration of 30 days from the day on which written notice of such suspension is received by the council for trade in goods, the application of substantially equivalent concessions or other obligations under gatt 1994, to the trade of the member applying the safeguard measure, the suspension of which the council for trade in goods does not disapprove.3. the right of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first three years that a safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the safeguard measure has been taken as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that such a measure conforms to the provisions of this agreement ARTICLE 9developing country members1. safeguard measures shall not be applied against a product originating in a developing country member as long as its share of imports of the product concerned in the importing member does not exceed 3 per cent, provided that developing country members with less than 3 per cent import share collectively account for not more than 9 per cent of total imports of the product concerned.[141]2. a developing country member shall have the right to extend the period of application of a safeguard measure for a period of up to two years beyond the maximum period provided for in paragraph 3 of article 7. notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5 of article 7, a developing country member shall have the right to apply a safeguard measure again to the import of a product which has been subject to such a measure, taken after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, after a period of time equal to half that during which such a measure has been previously applied, provided that the period of non-application is at least two years ARTICLE 10pre-existing article xix measuresmembers shall terminate all safeguard measures taken pursuant to article xix of gatt 1947 that were in existence on the date of entry into force of the wto agreement not later than eight years after the date on which they were first applied or five years after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, whichever comes later ARTICLE 11prohibition and elimination of certain measures1.

applied in accordance with this agreement.(b) furthermore, a member shall not seek, take or maintain any voluntary export restraints, orderly marketing arrangements or any other similar measures on the export or the import side.[142],143 these include actions taken by a single member as well as actions under agreements, arrangements and understandings entered into by two or more members. any such measure in effect on the date of entry into force of the wto agreement shall be brought into conformity with this agreement or phased out in accordance with paragraph 2.(c) this agreement does not apply to measures sought, taken or maintained by a member pursuant to provisions of gatt 1994 other than article xix, and multilateral trade agreements in annex 1a other than this agreement, or pursuant to protocols and agreements or arrangements concluded within the framework of gatt 1994.2. the phasing out of measures referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall be carried out according to timetables to be presented to the committee on safeguards by the members concerned not later than 180 days after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement. these timetables shall provide for

the members directly concerned and notified to the committee on safeguards for its review and acceptance within 90 days of the entry into force of the wto agreement. the annex to this agreement indicates a measure which has been agreed as falling under this exception.3. members shall not encourage or support the adoption or maintenance by public and private enterprises of non-governmental

ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with that member's obligations under article ii and specific commitments.2. where a member's monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to that member's specific commitments, the member shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.3. the council for trade in services may, at the request of a member which has a reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of any other member is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, request the member establishing, maintaining or authorizing such supplier to provide specific information concerning the relevant operations.4. if, after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, a member grants monopoly rights regarding the supply of a service covered by its specific commitments, that member shall notify the council for trade in

maintain restrictions on trade in services on which it has undertaken specific commitments, including on payments or transfers for transactions related to such commitments. it is recognized that particular pressures on the balance of payments of a member in the process of economic development or economic transition may necessitate the use of restrictions to ensure, inter alia, the maintenance of a level of financial reserves adequate for the implementation of its programme of economic development or economic transition.2. the restrictions referred to in paragraph 1:(a) shall not discriminate among members;(b) shall be consistent with the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund;(c) shall avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and financial interests of any other member;(d) shall not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances described in paragraph 1;(e) shall be temporary and be phased out progressively as the situation

changes therein, shall be promptly notified to the general council.5.

[footnote appeared in original text.][101] in the case of programmes which span industrial research and pre-competitive development activity, the allowable level of non-actionable assistance shall not exceed the simple average of the allowable levels of non-actionable assistance applicable to the above two categories, calculated on the basis of all eligible costs as set forth in items (i) to (v) of this subparagraph. [footnote appeared in original text.][102] a "general framework of regional development" means that regional subsidy programmes are part of an internally consistent and generally applicable regional development policy and that regional development subsidies are not granted in isolated geographical points having no, or virtually no, influence on the development of a region. [footnote appeared in original text.][103] "neutral and objective criteria" means criteria which do not favour certain regions beyond what is appropriate for the elimination or reduction of regional disparities within the framework of the regional development policy. in this regard, regional subsidy programmes shall include ceilings on the amount of assistance which can be granted to each subsidized project. such ceilings must be differentiated according to the different levels of development of assisted regions and must be expressed in terms of investment costs or cost of job creation. within such ceilings, the distribution of assistance shall be sufficiently broad and even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or the granting of disproportionately large amounts of subsidy to, certain enterprises as provided for in article 2.

[footnote appeared in original text.][107] the term "countervailing duty" shall be understood to mean a special duty levied for the purpose of offsetting any subsidy bestowed directly or indirectly upon the manufacture, production or export of any merchandise, as provided for in paragraph 3 of article vi of gatt 1994. [footnote appeared in original text.][108] the term "initiated" as used hereinafter means procedural action by which a member formally commences an investigation as provided in article 11. [footnote appeared in original text.][109] in the case of fragmented industries involving an exceptionally large number of producers, authorities may determine support and opposition by using statistically valid sampling techniques. [footnote appeared in original text.][110] members are aware that in the territory of certain members employees of domestic producers of the like product or representatives of those employees may make or support an application for an investigation under paragraph 1. [footnote appeared in original text.][111] as a general rule, the time-limit for exporters shall be counted from the date of receipt of the questionnaire, which for this purpose shall be deemed to have been received one week from the date on which it was sent to the respondent or transmitted to the appropriate diplomatic representatives of the exporting member or, in the case of a separate customs territory member of the wto, an official representative of the exporting territory. [footnote appeared in original text.][112] it being understood that where the number of exporters involved is particularly high, the full text of the application should instead be provided only to the authorities of the exporting member or to the relevant trade association who then should forward copies to the exporters concerned. [footnote appeared in original text.][113] members are aware that in the territory of certain members disclosure pursuant to a narrowly-drawn protective order may be required. [footnote appeared in original text.][114] members agree that requests for confidentiality should not be arbitrarily rejected. members further agree that the investigating authority may request the waiving of confidentiality only regarding information relevant to the proceedings. [footnote appeared in original text.][115] it is particularly important, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, that no affirmative determination whether preliminary or final be made without reasonable opportunity for consultations having been given. such consultations may establish the basis for proceeding under the provisions of part ii, iii or x. [footnote appeared in original text.][116] under this agreement the term "injury" shall, unless otherwise specified, be taken to mean material injury to a domestic industry, threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishment of such an industry and shall be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of this article. [footnote appeared in original text.][117] throughout this agreement the term "like product" (produit similaire) shall be interpreted to mean a product which is identical, i.e. alike in all respects to the product under consideration, or in the absence of such a product, another product which, although not alike in all respects, has characteristics closely resembling those of the product under consideration. [footnote appeared in original text.][118] as set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4. [footnote appeared in original text.][119] for the purpose of this paragraph, producers shall be deemed to be related to exporters or importers only if (a) one of them directly or indirectly controls the other; or (b) both of them are directly or indirectly controlled by a third person; or (c) together they directly or indirectly control a third person, provided that there are grounds for believing or suspecting that the effect of the relationship is such as to cause the producer concerned to behave differently from non-related producers. for the purpose of this paragraph, one shall be deemed to control another when the former is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the latter. [footnote appeared in original text.][120] the word "may" shall not be interpreted to allow the simultaneous continuation of proceedings with the implementation of undertakings, except as provided in paragraph 4. [footnote appeared in original text.][121] for the purpose of this paragraph, the term "domestic interested parties" shall include consumers and industrial users of the imported product subject to investigation. [footnote appeared in original text.][122] as used in this agreement "levy" shall mean the definitive or final legal assessment or collection of a duty or tax. [footnote appeared in original text.][123] when the amount of the countervailing duty is assessed on a retrospective basis, a finding in the most recent assessment proceeding that no duty is to be levied shall not by itself require the authorities to terminate the definitive duty. [footnote appeared in original text.][124] where authorities provide information and explanations under the provisions of this article in a separate report, they shall ensure that such report is readily available to the public. [footnote appeared in original text.][125] the committee shall establish a working party to review the contents and form of the questionnaire as contained in bisd 9s/193-194. [footnote appeared in original text.][126] for a developing country member not granting export subsidies as of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, this paragraph shall apply on the basis of the level of export subsidies granted in 1986.

[footnote appeared in original text.][130] the members recognize that deferral need not amount to an export subsidy where, for example, appropriate interest charges are collected. the members reaffirm the principle that prices for goods in transactions between exporting enterprises and foreign buyers under their or under the same control should for tax purposes be the prices which would be charged between independent enterprises acting at arm's length. any member may draw the attention of another member to administrative or other practices which may contravene this principle and which result in a significant saving of direct taxes in export transactions. in such circumstances the members shall normally attempt to resolve their differences using the facilities of existing bilateral tax treaties or other specific international mechanisms, without prejudice to the rights and obligations of members under gatt 1994, including the right of consultation created in the preceding sentence.paragraph (e) is not intended to limit a member from taking measures to avoid the double taxation of foreign-source income earned by its enterprises or the enterprises of another member. [footnote appeared in original text.][131] paragraph (h) does not apply to value-added tax systems and border-tax adjustment in lieu thereof; the problem of the excessive remission of value-added taxes is exclusively covered by paragraph (g). [footnote appeared in original text.][132] inputs consumed in the production process are inputs physically incorporated, energy, fuels and oil used in the production process and catalysts which are consumed in the course of their use to obtain the exported product.

[footnote appeared in original text.][134] the recipient firm is a firm in the territory of the subsidizing member. [footnote appeared in original text.][135] in the case of tax-related subsidies the value of the product shall be calculated as the total value of the recipient firm's sales in the fiscal year in which the tax-related measure was earned. [footnote appeared in original text.][136] start-up situations include instances where financial commitments for product development or construction of facilities to manufacture products benefiting from the subsidy have been made, even though production has not begun. [footnote appeared in original text.][137] in cases where the existence of serious prejudice has to be demonstrated. [footnote appeared in original text.][138] the information-gathering process by the dsb shall take into account the need to protect information which is by nature confidential or which is provided on a confidential basis by any member involved in this process.

[footnote appeared in original text.][141] a member shall immediately notify an action taken under paragraph 1 of article 9 to the committee on safeguards. [footnote appeared in original text.][142] an import quota applied as a safeguard measure in conformity with the relevant provisions of gatt 1994 and this agreement may, by mutual agreement, be administered by the exporting member. [footnote appeared in original text.][143]examples of similar measures include export moderation, export-price or import-price monitoring systems, export or import surveillance, compulsory import cartels and discretionary export or import licensing schemes, any of which afford protection. [footnote appeared in original text.][144] the only such exception to which the european communities is entitled is indicated in the annex to this agreement. [footnote appeared in original text.][145] this condition is understood in terms of number of sectors, volume of trade affected and modes of supply. in order to meet this condition, agreements should not provide for the a priori exclusion of any mode of supply. [footnote appeared in original text.][146] typically, such integration provides citizens of the parties concerned with a right of free entry to the employment markets of the parties and includes measures concerning conditions of pay, other conditions of employment and social benefits. [footnote appeared in original text.][147] the term "relevant international organizations" refers to international bodies whose membership is open to the relevant bodies of at least all members of the wto. [footnote appeared in original text.][148] it is understood that the procedures under paragraph 5 shall be the same as the gatt 1994 procedures. [footnote appeared in original text.][149] the public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society. [footnote appeared in original text.][150] measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a member under its taxation system which:(i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the member's territory; or(ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the member's territory; or(iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures; or(iv) apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of another member in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the member's territory; or(v) distinguish service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or(vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the member's tax base.tax terms or concepts in paragraph (d) of article xiv and in this footnote are determined according to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the member taking the measure. [footnote appeared in original text.][151] a future work programme shall determine how, and in what time-frame, negotiations on such multilateral disciplines will be conducted. [footnote appeared in original text.][152] if a member undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in subparagraph 2(a) of article i and if the cross-border movement of capital is an essential part of the service itself, that member is thereby committed to allow such movement of capital. if a member undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in subparagraph 2(c) of article i, it is thereby committed to allow related transfers of capital into its territory. [footnote appeared in original text.][153] subparagraph 2(c) does not cover measures of a member which limit inputs for the supply of services. [footnote appeared in original text.][154] specific commitments assumed under this article shall not be construed to require any member to compensate for any inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or service suppliers. [footnote appeared in original text.][155] with respect to agreements on the avoidance of double taxation which exist on the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, such a matter may be brought before the council for trade in services only with the consent of both parties to such an agreement. [footnote appeared in original text.][156] where the service is not supplied directly by a juridical person but through other forms of commercial presence such as a branch or a representative office, the service supplier (i.e. the juridical person) shall, nonetheless, through such presence be accorded the treatment provided for service suppliers under the agreement. such treatment shall be extended to the presence through which the service is supplied and need not be extended to any other parts of the supplier located outside the territory where the service is supplied.

[footnote appeared in original text.][158] this paragraph is understood to mean that each member shall ensure that the obligations of this annex are applied with respect to suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks and services by whatever measures are necessary. [footnote appeared in original text.][159] the term "non-discriminatory" is understood to refer to most-favoured-nation and national treatment as defined in the agreement, as well as to reflect sector-specific usage of the term to mean "terms and conditions no less favourable than those accorded to any other user of like public telecommunications transport networks or services under like circumstances".

intellectual property rights, and to ensure that measures and procedures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves become barriers to legitimate trade;recognizing, to this end, the need for new rules and disciplines concerning:(a) the applicability of the basic principles of gatt 1994 and of relevant international intellectual property agreements or conventions;(b) the provision of adequate standards and principles concerning the availability, scope and use of trade-related intellectual property rights;(c) the provision of effective and appropriate means for the enforcement

reducing tensions by reaching strengthened commitments to resolve disputes on trade-related intellectual property issues through multilateral procedures;desiring to establish a mutually supportive relationship between the wto and the world intellectual property organization (referred to in this agreement as "wipo") as well as other relevant international organizations;hereby agree as follows:part igeneral provisions and basic principles ARTICLE 1nature and scope of obligations1. members shall give effect to the provisions of this agreement. members may, but shall not be obliged to, implement in their law more extensive protection than is required by this agreement, provided that such protection does not contravene the provisions of this agreement. members shall be free to

refers to all categories of intellectual property that are the subject of sections 1 through 7 of part ii.3. members shall accord the treatment provided for in this agreement to the nationals of other members.[1] in respect of the relevant intellectual property right, the nationals of other members shall be understood as those natural or legal persons that would meet the criteria for eligibility for protection provided for in the paris convention (1967), the berne convention (1971), the rome convention and the treaty on intellectual property in respect of integrated circuits, were all members of the wto members of those conventions.[2] any member availing itself of the possibilities provided in paragraph 3 of article 5 or paragraph 2 of article 6 of the rome convention shall make a notification as foreseen in those provisions to the council for trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (the "council for trips") ARTICLE 2intellectual property conventions1. in respect of parts ii, iii and iv of this agreement, members shall comply with articles 1 through 12, and article 19, of the paris convention (1967).2. nothing in parts i to iv of this agreement shall derogate from existing obligations that members may have to each other under the paris convention, the berne convention, the rome convention and the treaty on intellectual property in respect of integrated circuits ARTICLE 3national treatment1. each member shall accord to the nationals of other members treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection[3] of intellectual property, subject to the exceptions already provided in, respectively, the paris convention (1967), the berne convention (1971), the rome convention or the treaty on intellectual property in respect of integrated circuits. in respect of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations, this obligation only applies in respect of the rights provided under this agreement. any member availing itself of the possibilities provided in article 6 of the berne convention (1971) or paragraph 1(b) of article 16 of the rome convention shall make a notification as foreseen in those provisions to the council for trips.2. members may avail themselves of the exceptions permitted under paragraph 1 in relation to judicial and administrative procedures, including the designation of an address for service or the appointment of an agent within the jurisdiction of a member, only where such exceptions are necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement and where such practices are not applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on trade ARTICLE 4most-favoured-nation treatmentwith regard to the protection of intellectual property, any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity granted by a member to the nationals of any other country shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the nationals of all other members. exempted from this obligation are any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity accorded by a member:(a) deriving from international agreements on judicial assistance or law enforcement of a general nature and not particularly confined to the protection of intellectual property;(b) granted in accordance with the provisions of the berne convention (1971) or the rome convention authorizing that the treatment accorded be a function not of national treatment but of the treatment accorded in another country;(c) in respect of the rights of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations not provided under this agreement;(d) deriving from international agreements related to the protection of intellectual property which entered into force prior to the entry into force of the wto agreement, provided that such agreements are notified to the council for trips and do not constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against nationals of other members ARTICLE 5multilateral agreements on acquisition or maintenance of protectionthe obligations under articles 3 and 4 do not apply to procedures provided in multilateral agreements concluded under the auspices of wipo relating to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights ARTICLE 6exhaustionfor the purposes of dispute settlement under this agreement, subject to the provisions of articles 3 and 4 nothing in this agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual property rights ARTICLE 7objectivesthe protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations ARTICLE 8principles1. members may, in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition, and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to their socio-economic and technological development, provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of this agreement.2. appropriate measures, provided that they are consistent with the provisions of this agreement, may be needed to prevent the abuse of intellectual property rights by right holders or the resort to practices which unreasonably restrain trade or adversely affect the international transfer of technology.part iistandards concerning the availability, scope and use of intellectual property rightssection 1: copyright and related rights ARTICLE 9relation to the berne convention1. members shall comply with articles 1 through 21 of the berne convention (1971) and the appendix thereto. however, members shall not have

expressions and not to ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such ARTICLE 10computer programs and compilations of data1. computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the berne convention (1971).2. compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself ARTICLE 11rental rightsin respect of at least computer programs and cinematographic works, a member shall provide authors and their successors in title the right to authorize or to prohibit the commercial rental to the public of originals or copies of their copyright works. a member shall be excepted from this obligation in respect of cinematographic works unless such rental has led to widespread copying of such works which is materially impairing the exclusive right of reproduction conferred in that member on authors and their successors in title. in respect of computer programs, this obligation does not apply to rentals where the program itself is not the essential object of the rental ARTICLE 12term of protectionwhenever the term of protection of a work, other than a photographic work or a work of applied art, is calculated on a basis other than the life of a natural person, such term shall be no less than 50 years from the end of the calendar year of authorized publication, or, failing such authorized publication within 50 years from the making of the work, 50 years from the end of the calendar year of making

owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the berne convention (1971).4. the provisions of article 11 in respect of computer programs shall apply mutatis mutandis to producers of phonograms and any other right holders in phonograms as determined in a member's law. if on 15 april 1994 a member has in force a system of equitable remuneration of right holders in respect of the rental of phonograms, it may maintain such system provided that the commercial rental of phonograms is not giving rise to the material impairment of the exclusive rights of reproduction of right holders.5. the term of the protection available under this agreement to performers and producers of phonograms shall last at least until the end of a period of 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. the term of protection granted pursuant to paragraph 3 shall last for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.6. any member may, in relation to the rights conferred under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, provide for conditions, limitations, exceptions and reservations to the extent permitted by the rome convention. however, the provisions of article 18 of the berne convention (1971) shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the rights of performers and producers of phonograms in phonograms.section 2: trademarks ARTICLE 15protectable subject matter1. any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings, shall be capable of constituting a trademark. such signs, in particular words including personal names, letters, numerals, figurative elements and combinations of colours as well as any combination of such signs, shall be eligible for registration as trademarks. where signs are not inherently capable of distinguishing the relevant goods or services, members may make registrability depend on distinctiveness acquired through use. members may require, as a condition of registration, that signs be visually perceptible.2. paragraph 1 shall not be understood to prevent a member from denying registration of a trademark on other grounds, provided that they do not derogate from the provisions of the paris convention (1967).3. members may make registrability depend on use. however, actual use of a trademark shall not be a condition for filing an application for registration. an application shall not be refused solely on the ground that intended use has not taken place before the expiry of a period of three years from the date of application.4. the nature of the goods or services to which a trademark is to be applied shall in no case form an obstacle to registration of the trademark.5. members shall publish each trademark either before it is registered or promptly after it is registered and shall afford a reasonable opportunity for petitions to cancel the registration. in addition, members may afford an opportunity for the registration of a trademark to be opposed ARTICLE 16rights conferred1. the owner of a registered trademark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third parties not having the owner's consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs for goods or services which are identical or similar to those in respect of which the trademark is registered where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. in case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. the rights described above shall not prejudice any existing prior rights, nor shall they affect the possibility of members making rights available on the basis of use.2 ARTICLE 6bis of the paris convention (1967) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to services. in determining whether a trademark is well-known, members shall take account of the knowledge of the trademark in the relevant sector of the public, including knowledge in the member concerned which has been obtained as a result of the promotion of the trademark.3 ARTICLE 6bis of the paris convention (1967) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services which are not similar to those in respect of which a trademark is registered, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the registered trademark and provided that the interests of the owner of the registered trademark are likely to be damaged by such use ARTICLE 17exceptionsmembers may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owner of the trademark and of third parties ARTICLE 18term of protectioninitial registration, and each renewal of registration, of a trademark shall be for a term of no less than seven years. the registration of a trademark shall be renewable indefinitely ARTICLE 19requirement of use1. if use is required to maintain a registration, the registration may be cancelled only after an uninterrupted period of at least three years of non-use, unless valid reasons based on the existence of obstacles to such use are shown by the trademark owner. circumstances arising independently of the will of the owner of the trademark which constitute an obstacle to the use of the trademark, such as import restrictions on or other government requirements for goods or services protected by the trademark, shall be recognized as valid reasons for non-use.2. when subject to the control of its owner, use of a trademark by another person shall be recognized as use of the trademark for the purpose of maintaining the registration ARTICLE 20other requirementsthe use of a trademark in the course of trade shall not be unjustifiably encumbered by special requirements, such as use with another trademark, use in a special form or use in a manner detrimental to its capability to distinguish the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. this will not preclude a requirement prescribing the use of the trademark identifying the undertaking producing the goods or services along with, but without linking it to, the trademark distinguishing the specific goods or services in question of that undertaking ARTICLE 21licensing and assignmentmembers may determine conditions on the licensing and assignment of trademarks, it being understood that the compulsory licensing of trademarks shall not be permitted and that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the right to assign the trademark with or without the transfer of the business to which the trademark belongs.section 3: geographical indications ARTICLE 22protection of geographical indications1. geographical indications are, for the purposes of this agreement, indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.2. in respect of geographical indications, members shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent:(a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than the true place of origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good;(b) any use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of article 10bis of the paris convention (1967).3. a member shall, ex officio if its legislation so permits or at the request of an interested party, refuse or invalidate the registration of a trademark which contains or consists of a geographical indication with respect to goods not originating in the territory indicated, if use of the indication in the trademark for such goods in that member is of such a nature as to mislead the public as to the true place of origin.4. the protection under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be applicable against a geographical indication which, although literally true as to the territory, region or locality in which the goods originate, falsely represents to the public that the goods originate in another territory ARTICLE 23additional protection for geographical indications for wines and spirits1. each member shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent use of a geographical indication identifying wines for wines not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question or identifying spirits for spirits not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question, even where the true origin of the goods is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation or accompanied by expressions such as "kind", "type", "style", "imitation" or the like.[4]2. the registration of a trademark for wines which contains or consists of a geographical indication identifying wines or for spirits which contains or consists of a geographical indication identifying spirits shall be refused or invalidated, ex officio if a member's legislation so permits or at the request of an interested party, with respect to such wines or spirits not having this origin.3. in the case of homonymous geographical indications for wines, protection shall be accorded to each indication, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 22. each member shall determine the practical conditions under which the homonymous indications in question will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled.4. in order to facilitate the protection of geographical indications for wines, negotiations shall be undertaken in the council for trips concerning the establishment of a multilateral system of notification and registration of geographical indications for wines eligible for protection in those members participating in the system ARTICLE 24international negotiations; exceptions1. members agree to enter into negotiations aimed at increasing the protection of individual geographical indications under article 23. the provisions of paragraphs 4 through 8 below shall not be used by a member to refuse to conduct negotiations or to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements. in the context of such negotiations, members shall be willing to consider the continued applicability of these provisions to individual geographical indications whose use was the subject of such negotiations.2. the council for trips shall keep under review the application of the provisions of this section; the first such review shall take place within two years of the entry into force of the wto agreement. any matter affecting the compliance with the obligations under these provisions may be drawn to the attention of the council, which, at the request of a member, shall consult with any member or members in respect of such matter in respect of which it has not been possible to find a satisfactory solution through bilateral or plurilateral consultations between the members concerned. the council shall take such action as may be agreed to facilitate the operation and further the objectives of this section.3. in implementing this section, a member shall not diminish the protection of geographical indications that existed in that member immediately prior to the date of entry into force of the wto agreement.4. nothing in this section shall require a member to prevent continued and similar use of a particular geographical indication of another member identifying wines or spirits in connection with goods or services by any of its nationals or domiciliaries who have used that geographical indication in a continuous manner with regard to the same or related goods or services in the territory of that member either (a) for at least 10 years preceding 15 april 1994 or (b) in good faith preceding that date.5. where a trademark has been applied for or registered in good faith, or where rights to a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith either:(a) before the date of application of these provisions in that member as defined in part vi; or(b) before the geographical indication is protected in its country of origin;measures adopted to implement this section shall not prejudice eligibility for or the validity of the registration of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, on the basis that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, a geographical indication.6. nothing in this section shall require a member to apply its provisions in respect of a geographical indication of any other member with respect to goods or services for which the relevant indication is identical with the term customary in common language as the common name for such goods or services in the territory of that member. nothing in this section shall require a member to apply its provisions in respect of a geographical indication of any other member with respect to products of the vine for which the relevant indication is identical with the customary name of a grape variety existing in the territory of that member as of the date of entry into force of the wto agreement.7. a member may provide that any request made under this section in connection with the use or registration of a trademark must be presented within five years after the adverse use of the protected indication has become generally known in that member or after the date of registration of the trademark in that member provided that the trademark has been published by that date, if such date is earlier than the date on which the adverse use became generally known in that member, provided that the geographical indication is not used or registered in bad faith.8. the provisions of this section shall in no way prejudice the right of any person to use, in the course of trade, that person's name or the name of that person's predecessor in business, except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.9. there shall be no obligation under this agreement to protect geographical indications which are not or cease to be protected in their country of origin, or which have fallen into disuse in that country.section 4: industrial designs ARTICLE 25requirements for protection1. members shall provide for the protection of independently created industrial designs that are new or original. members may provide that designs are not new or original if they do not significantly differ from known designs or combinations of known design features. members may provide that such protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations.2. each member shall ensure that requirements for securing protection for textile designs, in particular in regard to any cost, examination or publication, do not unreasonably impair the opportunity to seek and obtain such protection. members shall be free to meet this obligation through industrial design law or through copyright law ARTICLE 26protection1. the owner of a protected industrial design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from making, selling or importing articles bearing or embodying a design which is a copy, or substantially a copy, of the protected design, when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.2. members may provide limited exceptions to the protection of industrial designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected industrial designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.3. the duration of protection available shall amount to at least 10 years.section 5: patents ARTICLE 27patentable subject matter1. subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, patents shall be available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new, involve an inventive step and are capable of industrial application.[5] subject to paragraph 4 of article 65, paragraph 8 of article 70 and paragraph 3 of this article, patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the place of invention, the field of technology and whether products are imported or locally produced.2. members may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law.3. members may also exclude from patentability:(a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals;(b) plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes. however, members shall provide for the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by an effective sui generis system or by any combination thereof. the provisions of this subparagraph shall be reviewed four years after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement ARTICLE 28rights conferred1. a patent shall confer on its owner the following exclusive rights:(a) where the subject matter of a patent is a product, to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from the acts of: making, using, offering for sale, selling, or importing[6] for these purposes that product;(b) where the subject matter of a patent is a process, to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from the act of using the process, and from the acts of: using, offering for sale, selling, or importing for these purposes at least the product obtained directly by that process.2. patent owners shall also have the right to assign, or transfer by succession, the patent and to conclude licensing contracts ARTICLE 29conditions on patent applicants1. members shall require that an applicant for a patent shall disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art and may require the applicant to indicate the best mode for carrying out the invention known to the inventor at the filing date or, where priority is claimed, at the priority date of the application.2. members may require an applicant for a patent to provide information concerning the applicant's corresponding foreign applications and grants ARTICLE 30exceptions to rights conferredmembers may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties ARTICLE 31other use without authorization of the right holderwhere the law of a member allows for other use[7] of the subject matter of a patent without the authorization of the right holder, including use by the government or third parties authorized by the government, the following provisions shall be respected:(a) authorization of such use shall be considered on its individual merits;(b) such use may only be permitted if, prior to such use, the proposed user has made efforts to obtain authorization from the right holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions and that such efforts have not been successful within a reasonable period of time. this requirement may be waived by a member in the case of a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. in situations of national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, the right holder shall, nevertheless, be notified as soon as reasonably practicable. in the case of public non-commercial use, where the government or contractor, without making a patent search, knows or has demonstrable grounds to know that a valid patent is or will be used by or for the government, the right holder shall be informed promptly;(c) the scope and duration of such use shall be limited to the purpose for which it was authorized, and in the case of semi-conductor technology shall only be for public non-commercial use or to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive;(d) such use shall be non-exclusive;(e) such use shall be non-assignable, except with that part of the enterprise or goodwill which enjoys such use;(f) any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the domestic market of the member authorizing such use;(g) authorization for such use shall be liable, subject to adequate protection of the legitimate interests of the persons so authorized, to be terminated if and when the circumstances which led to it cease to exist and are unlikely to recur. the competent authority shall have the authority to review, upon motivated request, the continued existence of these circumstances;(h) the right holder shall be paid adequate remuneration in the circumstances of each case, taking into account the economic value of the authorization;(i) the legal validity of any decision relating to the authorization of such use shall be subject to judicial review or other independent review by a distinct higher authority in that member;(j) any decision relating to the remuneration provided in respect of such use shall be subject to judicial review or other independent review by a distinct higher authority in that member;(k) members are not obliged to apply the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (f) where such use is permitted to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive. the need to correct anti-competitive practices may be taken into account in determining the amount of remuneration in such cases. competent authorities shall have the authority to refuse termination of authorization if and when the conditions which led to such authorization are likely to recur;(l) where such use is authorized to permit the exploitation of a patent ("the second patent") which cannot be exploited without infringing another patent ("the first patent"), the following additional conditions shall apply:(i) the invention claimed in the second patent shall involve an important technical advance of considerable economic significance in relation to the invention claimed in the first patent;(ii) the owner of the first patent shall be entitled to a cross-licence on reasonable terms to use the

the defendant to prove that the process to obtain an identical product is different from the patented process. therefore, members shall provide, in at least one of the following circumstances, that any identical product when produced without the consent of the patent owner shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to have been obtained by the patented process:(a) if the product obtained by the patented process is new;(b) if there is a substantial likelihood that the identical product was made by the process and the owner of the patent has been unable through reasonable efforts to determine the process actually used.2. any member shall be free to provide that the burden of proof indicated in paragraph 1 shall be on the alleged infringer only if the condition referred to in subparagraph (a) is fulfilled or only if the condition referred to in subparagraph (b) is fulfilled.3. in the adduction of proof to the contrary, the legitimate interests of defendants in protecting their manufacturing and business secrets shall be taken into account.section 6: layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits ARTICLE 35relation to the ipic treatymembers agree to provide protection to the layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits (referred to in this agreement as "layout-designs") in accordance with articles 2 through 7 (other than paragraph 3 of

selling, or otherwise distributing for commercial purposes a protected layout-design, an integrated circuit in which a protected layout-design is incorporated, or an article incorporating such an integrated circuit only in so far as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout-design ARTICLE 37acts not requiring the authorization of the right holder1. notwithstanding article 36, no member shall consider unlawful the performance of any of the acts referred to in that article in respect of an integrated circuit incorporating an unlawfully reproduced layout-design or any article incorporating such an integrated circuit where the person performing or ordering such acts did not know and had no reasonable ground to know, when acquiring the integrated circuit or article incorporating such an integrated circuit, that it incorporated an unlawfully reproduced layout-design. members shall provide that, after the time that such person has received sufficient notice that the layout-design was unlawfully reproduced, that person may perform any of the acts with respect to the stock on hand or ordered before such time, but shall be liable to pay to the right holder a sum equivalent to a reasonable royalty such as would be payable under a freely negotiated licence in respect of such a layout-design.2. the conditions set out in subparagraphs (a) through (k) of article 31 shall apply mutatis mutandis in the event of any non-voluntary licensing of a layout-design or of its use by or for the government without the authorization of the right holder ARTICLE 38term of protection1. in members requiring registration as a condition of protection, the term of protection of layout-designs shall not end before the expiration of a period of 10 years counted from the date of filing an application for registration or from the first commercial exploitation wherever in the world it occurs.2. in members not requiring registration as a condition for protection, layout-designs shall be protected for a term of no less than 10 years from the date of the first commercial exploitation wherever in the world it occurs.3. notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a member may provide that protection shall lapse 15 years after the creation of the layout-design.section 7: protection of undisclosed information ARTICLE 391. in the course of ensuring effective protection against unfair competition as provided in article 10bis of the paris convention (1967), members shall protect undisclosed information in accordance with paragraph 2 and data submitted to governments or governmental agencies in accordance with paragraph 3.2. natural and legal persons shall have the possibility of preventing information lawfully within their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices[10] so long as such information:(a) is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question;(b) has commercial value because it is secret; and(c) has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret.3. members, when requiring, as a condition of approving the marketing of pharmaceutical or of agricultural chemical products which utilize new chemical entities, the submission of undisclosed test or other data, the origination of which involves a considerable effort, shall protect such data against unfair commercial use. in addition, members shall protect such data against disclosure, except where necessary to protect the public, or unless steps are taken to ensure that the data are protected against unfair commercial use.section 8: control of anti-competitive practices in contractual licences ARTICLE 401. members agree that some licensing practices or conditions pertaining to intellectual property rights which restrain competition may have adverse effects on trade and may impede the transfer and dissemination of technology.2. nothing in this agreement shall prevent members from specifying in their legislation licensing practices or conditions that may in particular cases constitute an abuse of intellectual property rights having an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market. as provided above, a member may adopt, consistently with the other provisions of this agreement, appropriate measures to prevent or control such practices, which may include for example exclusive grantback conditions, conditions preventing challenges to validity and coercive package licensing, in the light of the relevant laws and regulations of that member.3. each member shall enter, upon request, into consultations with any other member which has cause to believe that an intellectual property right owner that is a national or domiciliary of the member to which the request for consultations has been addressed is undertaking practices in violation of the requesting member's laws and regulations on the subject matter of this section, and which wishes to secure compliance with such legislation, without prejudice to any action under the law and to the full freedom of an ultimate decision of either member. the member addressed shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to, and shall afford adequate opportunity for, consultations with the requesting member, and shall cooperate through supply of publicly available non-confidential information of relevance to the matter in question and of other information available to the member, subject to domestic law and to the conclusion of mutually satisfactory agreements concerning the safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting member.4. a member whose nationals or domiciliaries are subject to proceedings in another member concerning alleged violation of that other member's laws and regulations on the subject matter of this section shall, upon request, be granted an opportunity for consultations by the other member under the same conditions as those foreseen in paragraph 3.part iiienforcement of intellectual property rightssection 1: general obligations ARTICLE 411. members shall ensure that enforcement procedures as specified in this part are available under their law so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this agreement, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies which constitute a deterrent to further infringements. these procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.2. procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be fair and equitable. they shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.3. decisions on the merits of a case shall preferably be in writing and reasoned. they shall be made available at least to the parties to the proceeding without undue delay. decisions on the merits of a case shall be based only on evidence in respect of which parties were offered the opportunity to be heard.4. parties to a proceeding shall have an opportunity for review by a judicial authority of final administrative decisions and, subject to jurisdictional provisions in a member's law concerning the importance of a case, of at least the legal aspects of initial judicial decisions on the merits of a case. however, there shall be no obligation to provide an opportunity for review of acquittals in criminal cases.5. it is understood that this part does not create any obligation to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of members to enforce their law in general. nothing in this part creates any obligation with respect to the distribution of resources as between enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.section 2: civil and administrative procedures and remedies ARTICLE 42fair and equitable proceduresmembers shall make available to right holders[11] civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right covered by this agreement. defendants shall have the right to written notice which is timely and contains sufficient detail, including the basis of the claims. parties shall be allowed to be represented by independent legal counsel, and procedures shall not impose overly burdensome requirements concerning mandatory personal appearances. all parties to such procedures shall be duly entitled to substantiate their claims and to present all relevant evidence. the procedure shall provide a means to identify and protect confidential information, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements ARTICLE 43evidence1. the judicial authorities shall have the authority, where a party has presented reasonably available evidence sufficient to support its claims and has specified evidence relevant to substantiation of its claims which lies in the control of the opposing party, to order that this evidence be produced by the opposing party, subject in appropriate cases to conditions which ensure the protection of confidential information.2. in cases in which a party to a proceeding voluntarily and without good reason refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide necessary information within a reasonable period, or significantly impedes a procedure relating to an enforcement action, a member may accord judicial authorities the authority to make preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative, on the basis of the information presented to them, including the complaint or the allegation presented by the party adversely affected by the denial of access to information, subject to providing the parties an opportunity to be heard on the allegations or evidence ARTICLE 44injunctions1. the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, inter alia to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right, immediately after customs clearance of such goods. members are not obliged to accord such authority in respect of protected subject matter acquired or ordered by a person prior to knowing or having reasonable grounds to know that dealing in such subject matter would entail the infringement of an intellectual property right.2. notwithstanding the other provisions of this part and provided that the provisions of part ii specifically addressing use by governments, or by third parties authorized by a government, without the authorization of the right holder are complied with, members may limit the remedies available against such use to payment of remuneration in accordance with subparagraph (h) of article 31. in other cases, the remedies under this part shall apply or, where these remedies are inconsistent with a member's law, declaratory judgments and adequate compensation shall be available ARTICLE 45damages1. the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person's intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity.2. the judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder expenses, which may include appropriate attorney's fees. in appropriate cases, members may authorize the judicial authorities to order recovery of profits and/or payment of pre-established damages even where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity ARTICLE 46other remediesin order to create an effective deterrent to infringement, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that goods that they have found to be infringing be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm caused to the right holder, or, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements, destroyed. the judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order that materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the creation of the infringing goods be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements. in considering such requests, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the interests of third parties shall be taken into account. in regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit release of the goods into the channels of commerce ARTICLE 47right of informationmembers may provide that the judicial authorities shall have the authority, unless this would be out of proportion to the seriousness of the infringement, to order the infringer to inform the right holder of the identity of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services and of their channels of distribution ARTICLE 48indemnification of the defendant1. the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party at whose request measures were taken and who has abused enforcement procedures to provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained adequate compensation for the injury suffered because of such abuse. the judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant expenses, which may include appropriate attorney's fees.2. in respect of the administration of any law pertaining to the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights, members shall only exempt both public authorities and officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where actions are taken or intended in good faith in the course of the administration of that law ARTICLE 49administrative proceduresto the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set forth in this section.section 3: provisional measures ARTICLE 501. the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order prompt and effective provisional measures:(a) to prevent an infringement of any intellectual property right from occurring, and in particular to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of goods, including imported goods immediately after customs clearance;(b) to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the alleged infringement.2. the judicial authorities shall have the authority to adopt provisional measures inaudita altera parte where appropriate, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holder, or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed.3. the judicial authorities shall have the authority to require the applicant to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant is the right holder and that the applicant's right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse.4. where provisional measures have been adopted inaudita altera parte, the parties affected shall be given notice, without delay after the execution of the measures at the latest. a review, including a right to be heard, shall take place upon request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period after the notification of the measures, whether these measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed.5. the applicant may be required to supply other information necessary for the identification of the goods concerned by the authority that will execute the provisional measures.6. without prejudice to paragraph 4, provisional measures taken on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall, upon request by the defendant, be revoked or otherwise cease to have effect, if proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case are not initiated within a reasonable period, to be determined by the judicial authority ordering the measures where a member's law so permits or, in the absence of such a determination, not to exceed 20 working days or 31 calendar days, whichever is the longer.7. where the provisional measures are revoked or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement or threat of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, upon request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by these measures.8. to the extent that any provisional measure can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set forth in this section.section 4: special requirements related to border measures[12] ARTICLE 51suspension of release by customs authoritiesmembers shall, in conformity with the provisions set out below, adopt procedures[13] to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for suspecting that the importation of counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods[14] may take place, to lodge an application in writing with competent authorities, administrative or judicial, for the suspension by the customs authorities of the release into free circulation of such goods. members may enable such an application to be made in respect of goods which involve other infringements of intellectual property rights, provided that the requirements of this section are met. members may also provide for corresponding procedures concerning the suspension by the customs authorities of the release of infringing goods destined for exportation from their territories ARTICLE 52applicationany right holder initiating the procedures under article 51 shall be required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply a sufficiently detailed description of the goods to make them readily recognizable by the customs authorities. the competent authorities shall inform the applicant within a reasonable period whether they have accepted the application and, where determined by the competent authorities, the period for which the customs authorities will take action ARTICLE 53security or equivalent assurance1. the competent authorities shall have the authority to require an applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.2. where pursuant to an application under this section the release of goods involving industrial designs, patents, layout-designs or undisclosed information into free circulation has been suspended by customs authorities on the basis of a decision other than by a judicial or other independent authority, and the period provided for in article 55 has expired without the granting of provisional relief by the duly empowered authority, and provided that all other conditions for importation have been complied with, the owner, importer, or consignee of such goods shall be entitled to their release on the posting of a security in an amount sufficient to protect the right holder for any infringement. payment of such security shall not prejudice any other remedy available to the right holder, it being understood that the security shall be released if the right holder fails to pursue the right of action within a reasonable period of time ARTICLE 54notice of suspensionthe importer and the applicant shall be promptly notified of the suspension of the release of goods according to article 51 ARTICLE 55duration of suspensionif, within a period not exceeding 10 working days after the applicant has been served notice of the suspension, the customs authorities have not been informed that proceedings leading to a

of the goods, the goods shall be released, provided that all other conditions for importation or exportation have been complied with; in appropriate cases, this time-limit may be extended by another 10 working days. if proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case have been initiated, a review, including a right to be heard, shall take place upon request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period, whether these measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed. notwithstanding the above, where the suspension of the release of goods is carried out or continued in accordance with a provisional judicial measure, the provisions of paragraph 6 of article 50 shall apply ARTICLE 56indemnification of the importer and of the owner of the goodsrelevant

they have acquired prima facie evidence that an intellectual property right is being infringed:(a) the competent authorities may at any time seek from the right holder any information that may assist them to exercise these powers;(b) the importer and the right holder shall be promptly notified of the suspension. where the importer has lodged an appeal against the suspension with the competent authorities, the suspension shall be subject to the conditions, mutatis mutandis, set out at article 55;(c) members shall only exempt both public authorities and officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where actions are taken or intended in good faith ARTICLE 59remedieswithout prejudice to other rights of action open to the right holder and subject to the right of the

reasonable procedures and formalities. such procedures and formalities shall be consistent with the provisions of this agreement.2. where the acquisition of an intellectual property right is subject to the right being granted or registered, members shall ensure that the procedures for grant or registration, subject to compliance with the substantive conditions for acquisition of the right, permit the granting or registration of the right within a reasonable period of time so as to avoid unwarranted curtailment of the period of protection.3 ARTICLE 4 of the paris convention (1967) shall apply mutatis mutandis to service marks.4. procedures concerning the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights and, where a member's law provides for such procedures, administrative revocation and inter partes procedures such as opposition, revocation and cancellation, shall be governed by the general principles set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 41.5. final administrative decisions in any of the procedures referred to under paragraph 4 shall be subject to review by a judicial or quasi-judicial authority. however, there shall be no obligation to provide an opportunity

establishment of a common register containing these laws and regulations are successful. the council shall also consider in this connection any action required regarding notifications pursuant to the obligations under this agreement stemming from the provisions of article 6ter of the paris convention (1967).3. each member shall be prepared to supply, in response to a written request from another member, information of the sort referred to in paragraph 1. a member, having reason to believe that a specific judicial decision or administrative ruling or bilateral agreement in the area of

implementation of intellectual property laws and regulations, may also benefit from a period of delay as foreseen in paragraph 2.4. to the extent that a developing country member is obliged by this agreement to extend product patent protection to areas of technology not so protectable in its territory on the general date of application of this agreement for that member, as defined in paragraph

were commenced, or in respect of which a significant investment was made, before the date of acceptance of the wto agreement by that member, any member may provide for a limitation of the remedies available to the right holder as to the continued performance of such acts after the date of application of this agreement for that member. in such cases the member shall, however, at least provide

inventions can be filed;(b) apply to these applications, as of the date of application of this agreement, the criteria for patentability as laid down in this agreement as if those criteria were being applied on the date of filing in that member or, where priority is available and claimed, the priority date of the application; and(c) provide patent protection in accordance with this agreement as

marketing approval obtained in such other member ARTICLE 71review and amendment1. the council for trips shall review the implementation of this agreement after the expiration of the transitional period referred to in paragraph 2 of article 65. the council shall, having regard to the experience gained in its implementation, review it two years after that date, and at identical intervals

purpose of adjusting to higher levels of protection of intellectual property rights achieved, and in force, in other multilateral agreements and accepted under those agreements by all members of the wto may be referred to the ministerial conference for action in accordance with paragraph 6 of article x of the wto agreement on the basis of a consensus proposal from the council for trips ARTICLE

maintenance of international peace and security ANNEX 2understanding on rules and procedures governingthe settlement of disputesmembers hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE 1coverage and application1. the rules and procedures of this understanding shall apply to disputes brought pursuant to the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the agreements listed in appendix 1 to this understanding (referred to in this understanding as the "covered agreements"). the rules and procedures of this understanding shall also apply to consultations and the settlement of disputes between members concerning their rights and obligations under the provisions of the agreement establishing the world trade organization (referred to in this understanding as the "wto agreement") and of this understanding taken in isolation or in combination with any other covered agreement.2. the rules and procedures of this understanding shall apply subject to such special or additional rules and procedures on dispute settlement contained in the covered agreements as are identified in appendix 2 to this understanding. to the extent that there is a difference between the rules and procedures of this understanding and the special or additional rules and procedures set forth in appendix 2, the special or additional rules and procedures in appendix 2 shall prevail. in disputes involving rules and procedures under more than one covered agreement, if there is a conflict between special or additional rules and procedures of such agreements under review, and where the parties to the dispute cannot agree on rules and procedures within 20 days of the establishment of the panel, the chairman of the dispute settlement body provided for in paragraph 1 of article 2 (referred to in this understanding as the "dsb"), in consultation with the parties to the dispute, shall determine the rules and procedures to be followed within 10 days after a request by either member. the chairman shall be guided by the principle that special or additional rules and procedures should be used where possible, and the rules and procedures set out in this understanding should be used to the extent necessary to avoid conflict ARTICLE 2administration1. the dispute settlement body is hereby established to administer these rules and procedures and, except as otherwise provided in a covered agreement, the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements. accordingly, the dsb shall have the authority to establish panels, adopt panel and appellate body reports, maintain surveillance of implementation of rulings and recommendations, and authorize suspension of concessions and other obligations under the covered agreements. with respect to disputes arising under a covered agreement which is a plurilateral trade agreement, the term "member" as used herein shall refer only to those members that are parties to the relevant plurilateral trade agreement. where the dsb administers the dispute settlement provisions of a plurilateral trade agreement, only those members that are parties to that agreement may participate in decisions or actions taken by the dsb with respect to that dispute.2. the dsb shall inform the relevant wto councils and committees of any developments in disputes related to provisions of the respective covered agreements.3. the dsb shall meet as often as necessary to carry out its functions within the time-frames provided in this understanding.4. where the rules and procedures of this understanding provide for the dsb to take a decision, it shall do so by consensus.[15] ARTICLE 3general provisions1. members affirm their adherence to the principles for the management of disputes heretofore applied under articles xxii and xxiii of gatt 1947, and the rules and procedures as further elaborated and modified herein.2. the dispute settlement system of the wto is a central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system. the members recognize that it serves to preserve the rights and obligations of members under the covered agreements, and to clarify the existing provisions of those agreements in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of public international law. recommendations and rulings of the dsb cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in the covered agreements.3. the prompt settlement of situations in which a member considers that any benefits accruing to it directly or indirectly under the covered agreements are being impaired by measures taken by another member is essential to the effective functioning of the wto and the maintenance of a proper balance between the rights and obligations of members.4. recommendations or rulings made by the dsb shall be aimed at achieving a satisfactory settlement of the matter in accordance with the rights and obligations under this understanding and under the covered agreements.5. all solutions to matters formally raised under the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements, including arbitration awards, shall be consistent with those agreements and shall not nullify or impair benefits accruing to any member under those agreements, nor impede the attainment of any objective of those agreements.6. mutually agreed solutions to matters formally raised under the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements shall be notified to the dsb and the relevant councils and committees, where any member may raise any point relating thereto.7. before bringing a case, a member shall exercise its judgement as to whether action under these procedures would be fruitful. the aim of the dispute settlement mechanism is to secure a positive solution to a dispute. a solution mutually acceptable to the parties to a dispute and consistent with the covered agreements is clearly to be preferred. in the absence of a mutually agreed solution, the first objective of the dispute settlement mechanism is usually to secure the withdrawal of the measures concerned if these are found to be inconsistent with the provisions of any of the covered agreements. the provision of compensation should be resorted to only if the immediate withdrawal of the measure is impracticable and as a temporary measure pending the withdrawal of the measure which is inconsistent with a covered agreement. the last resort which this understanding provides to the member invoking the dispute settlement procedures is the possibility of suspending the application of concessions or other obligations under the covered agreements on a discriminatory basis vis-...-vis the other member, subject to authorization by the dsb of such measures.8. in cases where there is an infringement of the obligations assumed under a covered agreement, the action is considered prima facie to constitute a case of nullification or impairment. this means that there is normally a presumption that a breach of the rules has an adverse impact on other members parties to that covered agreement, and in such cases, it shall be up to the member against whom the complaint has been brought to rebut the charge.9. the provisions of this understanding are without prejudice to the rights of members to seek authoritative interpretation of provisions of a covered agreement through decision-making under the wto agreement or a covered agreement which is a plurilateral trade agreement.10. it is understood that requests for conciliation and the use of the dispute settlement procedures should not be intended or considered as contentious acts and that, if a dispute arises, all members will engage in these procedures in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute. it is also understood that complaints and counter-complaints in regard to distinct matters should not be linked.11. this understanding shall be applied only with respect to new requests for consultations under the consultation provisions of the covered agreements made on or after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement. with respect to disputes for which the request for consultations was made under gatt 1947 or under any other predecessor agreement to the covered agreements before the date of entry into force of the wto agreement, the relevant dispute settlement rules and procedures in effect immediately prior to the date of entry into force of the wto agreement shall continue to apply.[16]12. notwithstanding paragraph 11, if a complaint based on any of the covered agreements is brought by a developing country member against a developed country member, the complaining party shall have the right to invoke, as an alternative to the provisions contained in articles 4, 5, 6 and 12 of this understanding, the corresponding provisions of the decision of 5 april 1966 (bisd 14s/18), except that where the panel considers that the time-frame provided for in paragraph 7 of that decision is insufficient to provide its report and with the agreement of the complaining party, that time-frame may be extended. to the extent that there is a difference between the rules and procedures of articles 4, 5, 6 and 12 and the corresponding rules and procedures of the decision, the latter shall prevail ARTICLE 4consultations1. members affirm their resolve to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the consultation procedures employed by members.2. each member undertakes to accord sympathetic consideration to and afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding any representations made by another member concerning measures affecting the operation of any covered agreement taken within the territory of the former.[17]3. if a request for consultations is made pursuant to a covered agreement, the member to which the request is made shall, unless otherwise mutually agreed, reply to the request within 10 days after the date of its receipt and shall enter into consultations in good faith within a period of no more than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request, with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution. if the member does not respond within 10 days after the date of receipt of the request, or does not enter into consultations within a period of no more than 30 days, or a period otherwise mutually agreed, after the date of receipt of the request, then the member that requested the holding of consultations may proceed directly to request the establishment of a panel.4. all such requests for consultations shall be notified to the dsb and the relevant councils and committees by the member which requests consultations. any request for consultations shall be submitted in writing and shall give the reasons for the request, including identification of the measures at issue and an indication of the legal basis for the complaint.5. in the course of consultations in accordance with the provisions of a covered agreement, before resorting to further action under this understanding, members should attempt to obtain satisfactory adjustment of the matter.6. consultations shall be confidential, and without prejudice to the rights of any member in any further proceedings.7. if the consultations fail to settle a dispute within 60 days after the date of receipt of the request for consultations, the complaining party may request the establishment of a panel. the complaining party may request a panel during the 60-day period if the consulting parties jointly consider that consultations have failed to settle the dispute.8. in cases of urgency, including those which concern perishable goods, members shall enter into consultations within a period of no more than 10 days after the date of receipt of the request. if the consultations have failed to settle the dispute within a period of 20 days after the date of receipt of the request, the complaining party may request the establishment of a panel.9. in cases of urgency, including those which concern perishable goods, the parties to the dispute, panels and the appellate body shall make every effort to accelerate the proceedings to the greatest extent possible.10. during consultations members should give special attention to the particular problems and interests of developing country members.11. whenever a member other than the consulting members considers that it has a substantial trade interest in consultations being held pursuant to paragraph 1 of article xxii of gatt 1994, paragraph 1 of article xxii of gats, or the corresponding provisions in other covered agreements[18], such member may notify the consulting members and the dsb, within 10 days after the date of the circulation of the request for consultations under said article, of its desire to be joined in the consultations. such member shall be joined in the consultations, provided that the member to which the request for consultations was addressed agrees that the claim of substantial interest is well-founded. in that event they shall so inform the dsb. if the request to be joined in the consultations is not accepted, the applicant member shall be free to request consultations under paragraph 1 of article xxii or paragraph 1 of article xxiii of gatt 1994, paragraph 1 of article xxii or paragraph 1 of article xxiii of gats, or the corresponding provisions in other covered agreements ARTICLE 5good offices, conciliation and mediation1. good offices, conciliation and mediation are procedures that are undertaken voluntarily if the parties to the dispute so agree.2. proceedings involving good offices, conciliation and mediation, and in particular positions taken by the parties to the dispute during these proceedings, shall be confidential, and without prejudice to the rights of either party in any further proceedings under these procedures.3. good offices, conciliation or mediation may be requested at any time by any party to a dispute. they may begin at any time and be terminated at any time. once procedures for good offices, conciliation or mediation are terminated, a complaining party may then proceed with a request for the establishment of a panel.4. when good offices, conciliation or mediation are entered into within 60 days after the date of receipt of a request for consultations, the complaining party must allow a period of 60 days after the date of receipt of the request for consultations before requesting the establishment of a panel. the complaining party may request the establishment of a panel during the 60-day period if the parties to the dispute jointly consider that the good offices, conciliation or mediation process has failed to settle the dispute.5. if the parties to a dispute agree, procedures for good offices, conciliation or mediation may continue while the panel process proceeds.6. the director-general may, acting in an ex officio capacity, offer good offices, conciliation or mediation with the view to assisting members to settle a dispute ARTICLE 6establishment of panels1. if the complaining party so requests, a panel shall be established at the latest at the dsb meeting following that at which the request first appears as an item on the dsb's agenda, unless at that meeting the dsb decides by consensus not to establish a panel.[19]2. the request for the establishment of a panel shall be made in writing. it shall indicate whether consultations were held, identify the specific measures at issue and provide a brief summary of the legal basis of the complaint sufficient to present the problem clearly. in case the applicant requests the establishment of a panel with other than standard terms of reference, the written request shall include the proposed text of special terms of reference ARTICLE 7terms of reference of panels1. panels shall have the following terms of reference unless the parties to the dispute agree otherwise within 20 days from the establishment of the panel:"to examine, in the light of the relevant provisions in (name of the covered agreement(s) cited by the parties to the dispute), the matter referred to the dsb by (name of party) in document . . . and to make such findings as will assist the dsb in making the recommendations or in giving the rulings provided for in that/those agreement(s)."2. panels shall address the relevant provisions in any covered agreement or agreements cited by the parties to the dispute.3. in establishing a panel, the dsb may authorize its chairman to draw up the terms of reference of the panel in consultation with the parties to the dispute, subject to the provisions of paragraph 1. the terms of reference thus drawn up shall be circulated to all members. if other than standard terms of reference are agreed upon, any member may raise any point relating thereto in the dsb ARTICLE 8composition of panels1. panels shall be composed of well-qualified governmental and/or non-governmental individuals, including persons who have served on or presented a case to a panel, served as a representative of a member or of a contracting party to gatt 1947 or as a representative to the council or committee of any covered agreement or its predecessor agreement, or in the secretariat, taught or published on international trade law or policy, or served as a senior trade policy official of a member.2. panel members should be selected with a view to ensuring the independence of the members, a sufficiently diverse background and a wide spectrum of experience.3. citizens of members whose governments[20] are parties to the dispute or third parties as defined in paragraph 2 of article 10 shall not serve on a panel concerned with that dispute, unless the parties to the dispute agree otherwise.4. to assist in the selection of panelists, the secretariat shall maintain an indicative list of governmental and non-governmental individuals possessing the qualifications outlined in paragraph 1, from which panelists may be drawn as appropriate. that list shall include the roster of non-governmental panelists established on 30 november 1984 (bisd 31s/9), and other rosters and indicative lists established under any of the covered agreements, and shall retain the names of persons on those rosters and indicative lists at the time of entry into force of the wto agreement. members may periodically suggest names of governmental and non-governmental individuals for inclusion on the indicative list, providing relevant information on their knowledge of international trade and of the sectors or subject matter of the covered agreements, and those names shall be added to the list upon approval by the dsb. for each of the individuals on the list, the list shall indicate specific areas of experience or expertise of the individuals in the sectors or subject matter of the covered agreements.5. panels shall be composed of three panelists unless the parties to the dispute agree, within 10 days from the establishment of the panel, to a panel composed of five panelists. members shall be informed promptly of the composition of the panel.6. the secretariat shall propose nominations for the panel to the parties to the dispute. the parties to the dispute shall not oppose nominations except for compelling reasons.7. if there is no agreement on the panelists within 20 days after the date of the establishment of a panel, at the request of either party, the director-general, in consultation with the chairman of the dsb and the chairman of the relevant council or committee, shall determine the composition of the panel by appointing the panelists whom the director-general considers most appropriate in accordance with any relevant special or additional rules or procedures of the covered agreement or covered agreements which are at issue in the dispute, after consulting with the parties to the dispute. the chairman of the dsb shall inform the members of the composition of the panel thus formed no later than 10 days after the date the chairman receives such a request.8. members shall undertake, as a general rule, to permit their officials to serve as panelists.9. panelists shall serve in their individual capacities and not as government representatives, nor as representatives of any organization. members shall therefore not give them instructions nor seek to influence them as individuals with regard to matters before a panel.10. when a dispute is between a developing country member and a developed country member the panel shall, if the developing country member so requests, include at least one panelist from a developing country member.11. panelists' expenses, including travel and subsistence allowance, shall be met from the wto budget in accordance with criteria to be adopted by the general council, based on recommendations of the committee on budget, finance and administration ARTICLE 9procedures for multiple complainants1. where more than one member requests the establishment of a panel related to the same matter, a single panel may be established to examine these complaints taking into account the rights of all members concerned. a single panel should be established to examine such complaints whenever feasible.2. the single panel shall organize its examination and present its findings to the dsb in such a manner that the rights which the parties to the dispute would have enjoyed had separate panels examined the complaints are in no way impaired. if one of the parties to the dispute so requests, the panel shall submit separate reports on the dispute concerned. the written submissions by each of the complainants shall be made available to the other complainants, and each complainant shall have the right to be present when any one of the other complainants presents its views to the panel.3. if more than one panel is established to examine the complaints related to the same matter, to the greatest extent possible the same persons shall serve as panelists on each of the separate panels and the timetable for the panel process in such disputes shall be harmonized ARTICLE 10third parties1. the interests of the parties to a dispute and those of other members under a covered agreement at issue in the dispute shall be fully taken into account during the panel process.2. any member having a substantial interest in a matter before a panel and having notified its interest to the dsb (referred to in this understanding as a "third party") shall have an opportunity to be heard by the panel and to make written submissions to the panel. these submissions shall also be given to the parties to the dispute and shall be reflected in the panel report.3. third parties shall receive the submissions of the parties to the dispute to the first meeting of the panel.4. if a third party considers that a measure already the subject of a panel proceeding nullifies or impairs benefits accruing to it under any covered agreement, that member may have recourse to normal dispute settlement procedures under this understanding. such a dispute shall be referred to the original panel wherever possible ARTICLE 11function of panelsthe function of panels is to assist the dsb in discharging its responsibilities under this understanding and the covered agreements. accordingly, a panel should make an objective assessment of the matter before it, including an objective assessment of the facts of the case and the applicability of and conformity with the relevant covered agreements, and make such other findings as will assist the dsb in making the recommendations or in giving the rulings provided for in the covered agreements. panels should consult regularly with the parties to the dispute and give them adequate opportunity to develop a mutually satisfactory solution ARTICLE 12panel procedures1. panels shall follow the working procedures in appendix 3 unless the panel decides otherwise after consulting the parties to the dispute.2. panel procedures should provide sufficient flexibility so as to ensure high-quality panel reports, while not unduly delaying the panel process.3. after consulting the parties to the dispute, the panelists shall, as soon as practicable and whenever possible within one week after the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon, fix the timetable for the panel process, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 9 of article 4, if relevant.4. in determining the timetable for the panel process, the panel shall provide sufficient time for the parties to the dispute to prepare their submissions.5. panels should set precise deadlines for written submissions by the parties and the parties should respect those deadlines.6. each party to the dispute shall deposit its written submissions with the secretariat for immediate transmission to the panel and to the other party or parties to the dispute. the complaining party shall submit its first submission in advance of the responding party's first submission unless the panel decides, in fixing the timetable referred to in paragraph 3 and after consultations with the parties to the dispute, that the parties should submit their first submissions simultaneously. when there are sequential arrangements for the deposit of first submissions, the panel shall establish a firm time-period for receipt of the responding party's submission. any subsequent written submissions shall be submitted simultaneously.7. where the parties to the dispute have failed to develop a mutually satisfactory solution, the panel shall submit its findings in the form of a written report to the dsb. in such cases, the report of a panel shall set out the findings of fact, the applicability of relevant provisions and the basic rationale behind any findings and recommendations that it makes. where a settlement of the matter among the parties to the dispute has been found, the report of the panel shall be confined to a brief description of the case and to reporting that a solution has been reached.8. in order to make the procedures more efficient, the period in which the panel shall conduct its examination, from the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon until the date the final report is issued to the parties to the dispute, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months. in cases of urgency, including those relating to perishable goods, the panel shall aim to issue its report to the parties to the dispute within three months.9. when the panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months, or within three months in cases of urgency, it shall inform the dsb in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report. in no case should the period from the establishment of the panel to the circulation of the report to the members exceed nine months.10. in the context of consultations involving a measure taken by a developing country member, the parties may agree to extend the periods established in paragraphs 7 and 8 of article 4. if, after the relevant period has elapsed, the consulting parties cannot agree that the consultations have concluded, the chairman of the dsb shall decide, after consultation with the parties, whether to extend the relevant period and, if so, for how long. in addition, in examining a complaint against a developing country member, the panel shall accord sufficient time for the developing country member to prepare and present its argumentation. the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 20 and paragraph 4 of article 21 are not affected by any action pursuant to this paragraph.11. where one or more of the parties is a developing country member, the panel's report shall explicitly indicate the form in which account has been taken of relevant provisions on differential and more-favourable treatment for developing country members that form part of the covered agreements which have been raised by the developing country member in the course of the dispute settlement procedures.12. the panel may suspend its work at any time at the request of the complaining party for a period not to exceed 12 months. in the event of such a suspension, the time-frames set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of this article, paragraph 1 of article 20, and paragraph 4 of article 21 shall be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. if the work of the panel has been suspended for more than 12 months, the authority for establishment of the panel shall lapse ARTICLE 13right to seek information1. each panel shall have the right to seek information and technical advice from any individual or body which it deems appropriate. however, before a panel seeks such information or advice from any individual or body within the jurisdiction of a member it shall inform the authorities of that member. a member should respond promptly and fully to any request by a panel for such information as the panel considers necessary and appropriate. confidential information which is provided shall not be revealed without formal authorization from the individual, body, or authorities of the member providing the information.2. panels may seek information from any relevant source and may consult experts to obtain their opinion on certain aspects of the matter. with respect to a factual issue concerning a scientific or other technical matter raised by a party to a dispute, a panel may request an advisory report in writing from an expert review group. rules for the establishment of such a group and its procedures are set forth in appendix 4 ARTICLE 14confidentiality1. panel deliberations shall be

(factual and argument) sections of its draft report to the parties to the dispute. within a period of time set by the panel, the parties shall submit their comments in writing.2. following the expiration of the set period of time for receipt of comments from the parties to the dispute, the panel shall issue an interim report to the parties, including both the descriptive sections and the panel's findings and conclusions. within a period of time set by the panel, a party may submit a written request for the panel to review precise aspects of the interim report prior to circulation of the final report to the members. at the request of a party, the panel shall hold a further meeting with the parties on the issues identified in the written comments. if no comments are received from any party within the comment period, the interim report shall be considered the final panel report and circulated promptly to the members.3. the findings of the final panel report shall include a discussion of the arguments made at the interim review stage. the interim review stage shall be conducted within the time-period set out in paragraph 8 of article 12 ARTICLE 16adoption of panel

public. members shall treat as confidential information submitted by another member to the panel or the appellate body which that member has designated as confidential. a party to a dispute shall also, upon request of a member, provide a non-confidential summary of the information contained in its written submissions that could be disclosed to the public ARTICLE 19panel and appellate body

at a dsb meeting held within 30 days[25] after the date of adoption of the panel or appellate body report, the member concerned shall inform the dsb of its intentions in respect of implementation of the recommendations and rulings of the dsb. if it is impracticable to comply immediately with the recommendations and rulings, the member concerned shall have a reasonable period of time in which to do so. the reasonable period of time shall be:(a) the period of time proposed by the member concerned, provided that such period is approved by the dsb; or, in the absence of such approval,(b) a period of time mutually agreed by the parties to the dispute within 45 days after the date of adoption of the recommendations and rulings; or, in the absence of such agreement,(c) a period of time determined through binding arbitration within 90 days after the date of adoption of the recommendations and rulings.[26] in such arbitration, a guideline for the arbitrator[27] should be that the reasonable period of time to implement panel or appellate body recommendations should not exceed 15 months from the date of adoption of a panel or appellate body report. however, that time may be shorter or longer, depending upon the particular circumstances.4. except where the panel or the appellate body has extended, pursuant to paragraph 9 of article 12 or paragraph 5 of article 17, the time of providing its report, the period from the date of establishment of the panel by the dsb until the date of determination of the reasonable period of time shall not exceed 15 months unless the

under surveillance the implementation of adopted recommendations or rulings. the issue of implementation of the recommendations or rulings may be raised at the dsb by any member at any time following their adoption. unless the dsb decides otherwise, the issue of implementation of the recommendations or rulings shall be placed on the agenda of the dsb meeting after six months following the date of establishment of the reasonable period of time pursuant to paragraph 3 and shall remain on the dsb's agenda until the issue is resolved. at least 10 days prior to each such dsb meeting, the member concerned shall provide the dsb with a status report in writing of its progress in the implementation of the recommendations or rulings.7. if the matter is one which has been raised by a developing country member, the dsb shall consider what further action it might take which would be appropriate to the circumstances.8. if the case is one brought by a developing country member, in considering what appropriate action might be taken, the dsb shall take into account not only the trade coverage of measures complained of, but also their impact on the economy of developing country members concerned ARTICLE 22compensation and the suspension of concessions1. compensation and the suspension of concessions or other obligations are temporary measures available in the event that the recommendations and rulings are not implemented within a reasonable period of time. however, neither compensation nor the suspension of concessions or other obligations is preferred to full implementation of a recommendation to bring a measure into conformity with the covered agreements. compensation is voluntary and, if granted, shall be consistent with the covered agreements.2. if the member concerned fails to bring the measure found to be inconsistent with a covered agreement into compliance therewith or otherwise comply with the recommendations and rulings within the reasonable period of time determined pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 21, such member shall, if so requested, and no later than the expiry of the reasonable period of time, enter into negotiations with any party having invoked the dispute settlement procedures, with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation. if no satisfactory compensation has been agreed within 20 days after the date of expiry of the reasonable period of time, any party having invoked the dispute settlement procedures may request authorization from the dsb to suspend the application to the member concerned of concessions or other obligations under the covered agreements.3. in considering what concessions or other obligations to suspend, the complaining party shall apply the following principles and procedures:(a) the general principle is that the complaining party should first seek to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s) as that in which the panel or appellate body has found a violation or other nullification or impairment;(b) if that party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s), it may seek to suspend concessions or other obligations in other sectors under the same agreement;(c) if that party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to other sectors under the same agreement, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may seek to suspend concessions or other obligations under another covered agreement;(d) in applying the above principles, that party shall take into account:(i) the trade in the sector or under the agreement under which the panel or appellate body has found a violation or other nullification or impairment, and the importance of such trade to that party;(ii) the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the broader economic consequences of the suspension of concessions or other obligations;(e) if that party decides to request authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations pursuant to subparagraphs (b) or (c), it shall state the reasons therefor in its request. at the same time as the request is forwarded to the dsb, it also shall be forwarded to the relevant councils and also, in the case of a request pursuant to subparagraph (b), the relevant sectoral bodies;(f) for purposes of this paragraph, "sector" means:(i) with respect to goods, all goods;(ii) with respect to services, a principal sector as identified in the current "services sectoral classification list" which identifies such sectors;[28](iii) with respect to trade-related intellectual property rights, each of the categories of intellectual property rights covered in section 1, or section 2, or section 3, or section 4, or section 5, or section 6, or section 7 of part ii, or the obligations under part iii, or part iv of the agreement on trips;(g) for purposes of this paragraph, "agreement" means:(i) with respect to goods, the agreements listed in annex 1a of the wto agreement, taken as a whole as well as the plurilateral trade agreements in so far as the relevant parties to the dispute are parties to these agreements;(ii) with respect to services, the gats;(iii) with respect to intellectual property rights, the agreement on trips.4. the level of the suspension of concessions or other obligations authorized by the dsb shall be equivalent to the level of the nullification or impairment.5. the dsb shall not authorize suspension of concessions or other obligations if a covered agreement prohibits such suspension.6. when the situation described in paragraph 2 occurs, the dsb, upon request, shall grant authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations within 30 days of the expiry of the reasonable period of time unless the dsb decides by consensus to reject the request. however, if the member concerned objects to the level of suspension proposed, or claims that the principles and procedures set forth in paragraph 3 have not been followed where a complaining party has requested authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations pursuant to paragraph 3(b) or (c), the matter shall be referred to arbitration. such arbitration shall be carried out by the original panel, if members are available, or by an arbitrator[29] appointed by the director-general and shall be completed within 60 days after the date of expiry of the reasonable period of time. concessions or other obligations shall not be suspended during the course of the arbitration.7. the arbitrator[30] acting pursuant to paragraph 6 shall not examine the nature of the concessions or other obligations to be suspended but shall determine whether the level of such suspension is equivalent to the level of nullification or impairment. the arbitrator may also determine if the proposed suspension of concessions or other obligations is allowed under the covered agreement. however, if the matter referred to arbitration includes a claim that the principles and procedures set forth in paragraph 3 have not been followed, the arbitrator shall examine that claim. in the event the arbitrator determines that those principles and procedures have not been followed, the complaining party shall apply them consistent with paragraph 3. the parties shall accept the arbitrator's decision as final and the parties concerned shall not seek a second arbitration. the dsb shall be informed promptly of the decision of the arbitrator and shall upon request, grant authorization to suspend concessions or other obligations where the request is consistent with the decision of the arbitrator, unless the dsb decides by consensus to reject the request.8. the suspension of concessions or other obligations shall be temporary and shall only be applied until such time as the measure found to be inconsistent with a covered agreement has been removed, or the member that must implement recommendations or rulings provides a solution to the nullification or impairment of benefits, or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached. in accordance with paragraph 6 of article 21, the dsb shall continue to keep under surveillance the implementation of adopted recommendations or rulings, including those cases where compensation has been provided or concessions or other obligations have been suspended but the recommendations to bring a measure into conformity with the covered agreements have not been implemented.9. the dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements may be invoked in respect of measures affecting their observance taken by regional or local governments or authorities within the territory of a member. when the dsb has ruled that a provision of a covered agreement has not been observed, the responsible member shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure its observance. the provisions of the covered agreements and this understanding relating to compensation and suspension of concessions or other obligations apply in cases where it has not been possible to secure such observance.[31] ARTICLE 23strengthening of the multilateral system1. when members seek the redress of a violation of obligations or other nullification or impairment of benefits under the covered agreements or an impediment to the attainment of any objective of the covered agreements, they shall have recourse to, and abide by, the rules and procedures of this understanding.2. in such cases, members shall:(a) not make a determination to the effect that a violation has occurred, that benefits have been nullified or impaired or that the attainment of any objective of the covered agreements has been impeded, except through recourse to dispute settlement in accordance with the rules and procedures of this understanding, and shall make any such determination consistent with the findings contained in the panel or appellate body report adopted by the dsb or an arbitration award rendered under this understanding;(b) follow the procedures set forth in article 21 to determine the reasonable period of time for the member concerned to implement the recommendations and rulings; and(c) follow the procedures set forth in article 22 to determine the level of suspension of concessions or other obligations and obtain dsb authorization in accordance with those procedures before suspending concessions or other obligations under the covered agreements in response to the failure of the member concerned to implement the recommendations and rulings within that reasonable period of time ARTICLE 24special procedures involving least-developed country members1. at all stages of the determination of the causes of a dispute and of dispute settlement procedures involving a least-developed country member, particular consideration shall be given to the special situation of least-developed country members. in this regard, members shall exercise due restraint in raising matters under these procedures involving a least-developed country member. if nullification or impairment is found to result from a measure taken by a least-developed country member, complaining parties shall exercise due restraint in asking for compensation or seeking authorization to suspend the application of concessions or other obligations pursuant to these procedures.2. in dispute settlement cases involving a least-developed country member, where a satisfactory solution has not been found in the course of consultations the director-general or the chairman of the dsb shall, upon request by a least-developed country member offer their good offices, conciliation and mediation with a view to assisting the parties to settle the dispute, before a request for a panel is made. the director-general or the chairman of the dsb, in providing the above assistance, may consult any source which either deems appropriate ARTICLE 25arbitration1. expeditious arbitration within the wto as an alternative means of dispute settlement can facilitate the solution of certain disputes that concern issues that are clearly defined by both parties.2. except as otherwise provided in this understanding, resort to arbitration shall be subject to mutual agreement of the parties which shall agree on the procedures to be followed. agreements to resort to arbitration shall be notified to all members sufficiently in advance of the actual commencement of the arbitration process.3. other members may become party to an arbitration proceeding only upon the agreement of the parties which have agreed to have recourse to arbitration. the parties to the proceeding shall agree to abide by the arbitration award. arbitration awards shall be notified to the dsb and the council or committee of any relevant agreement where any member may raise any point relating thereto.4. articles 21 and 22 of this understanding shall apply mutatis mutandis to arbitration awards ARTICLE 261. non-violation complaints of the type described in paragraph 1(b) of article xxiii of gatt 1994where the provisions of paragraph 1(b) of article xxiii of gatt 1994 are applicable to a covered agreement, a panel or the appellate body may only make rulings and recommendations where a party to the dispute considers that any benefit accruing to it directly or indirectly under the relevant covered agreement is being nullified or impaired or the attainment of any objective of that agreement is being impeded as a result of the application by a member of any measure, whether or not it conflicts with the provisions of that agreement. where and to the extent that such party considers and a panel or the appellate body determines that a case concerns a measure that does not conflict with the provisions of a covered agreement to which the provisions of paragraph 1(b) of article xxiii of gatt 1994 are applicable, the procedures in this understanding shall apply, subject to the following:(a) the complaining party shall present a detailed justification in support of any complaint relating to a measure which does not conflict with the relevant covered agreement;(b) where a measure has been found to nullify or impair benefits under, or impede the attainment of objectives, of the relevant covered agreement without violation thereof, there is no obligation to withdraw the measure. however, in such cases, the panel or the appellate body shall recommend that the member concerned make a mutually satisfactory adjustment;(c) notwithstanding the provisions of article 21, the arbitration provided for in paragraph 3 of article 21, upon request of either party, may include a determination of the level of benefits which have been nullified or impaired, and may also suggest ways and means of reaching a mutually satisfactory adjustment; such suggestions shall not be binding upon the parties to the dispute;(d) notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 22, compensation may be part of a mutually satisfactory adjustment as final settlement of the dispute.2. complaints of the type described in paragraph 1(c) of article xxiii of gatt 1994where the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of article xxiii of gatt 1994 are applicable to a covered agreement, a panel may only make rulings and recommendations where a party considers that any benefit accruing to it directly or indirectly under the relevant covered agreement is being nullified or impaired or the attainment of any objective of that agreement is being impeded as a result of the existence of any situation other than those to which the provisions of paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) of article xxiii of gatt 1994 are applicable. where and to the extent that such party considers and a panel determines that the matter is covered by this paragraph, the procedures of this understanding shall apply only up to and including the point in the proceedings where the panel report has been circulated to the members. the dispute settlement rules and procedures contained in the decision of 12 april 1989 (bisd 36s/61-67) shall apply to consideration for adoption, and surveillance and implementation of recommendations and rulings. the following shall also apply:(a) the complaining party shall present a detailed justification in support of any argument made with respect to issues covered under this paragraph;(b) in cases involving matters covered by this paragraph, if a panel finds that cases also involve dispute settlement matters other than those covered by this paragraph, the panel shall circulate a report to the dsb addressing any such matters and a separate report on matters falling under this paragraph ARTICLE 27responsibilities of the secretariat1. the secretariat shall have the responsibility of assisting panels, especially on the legal, historical and procedural aspects of the matters dealt with, and of providing secretarial and technical support.2. while the secretariat assists members in respect of dispute settlement at their request, there may also be a need to provide additional legal advice and assistance in respect of dispute settlement to developing country members. to this end, the secretariat shall make available a qualified legal expert from the wto technical cooperation services to any developing country member which so requests. this expert shall assist the developing country member in a manner ensuring the continued impartiality of the secretariat.3. the secretariat shall conduct special training courses for interested members concerning these dispute settlement procedures and practices so as to enable members'

("tprm") is to contribute to improved adherence by all members to rules, disciplines and commitments made under the multilateral trade agreements and, where applicable, the plurilateral trade agreements, and hence to the smoother functioning of the multilateral trading system, by achieving greater transparency in, and understanding of, the trade policies and practices of members. accordingly, the review mechanism enables the regular collective appreciation and evaluation of the full range of individual members' trade policies and practices and their impact on the functioning of the multilateral trading system. it is not, however, intended to serve as a basis for the enforcement of specific obligations under the agreements or for dispute settlement procedures, or to impose new policy commitments on members.(ii) the assessment carried out under the review mechanism takes place, to the extent relevant, against the background of the wider economic and developmental needs, policies and objectives of the member concerned, as well as of its external environment. however, the function of the review mechanism is to examine the impact of a member's trade policies and practices on the multilateral trading system.b. domestic transparencymembers recognize the inherent value of domestic transparency of government decision-making on trade policy matters for both members' economies and the multilateral trading system, and agree to encourage and promote greater transparency within their own systems, acknowledging that the implementation of domestic transparency must be on a voluntary basis and take account of each member's legal and political systems.c. procedures for review(i) the trade policy review body (referred to herein as the "tprb") is hereby established to carry out trade policy reviews.(ii) the trade policies and practices of all members shall be subject to periodic review. the impact of individual members on the functioning of the multilateral trading system, defined in terms of their share of world trade in a recent representative period, will be the determining factor in deciding on the frequency of reviews. the first four trading entities so identified (counting the european communities as one) shall be subject to review every two years. the next 16 shall be reviewed every four years. other members shall be reviewed every six years, except that a longer period may be fixed for least-developed country members. it is understood that the review of entities having a common external policy covering more than one member shall cover all components of policy affecting trade including relevant policies and practices of the individual members. exceptionally, in the event of changes in a member's trade policies or practices that may have a significant impact on its trading partners, the member concerned may be requested by the tprb, after consultation, to bring forward its next review.(iii) discussions in the meetings of the tprb shall be governed by the objectives set forth in paragraph a. the focus of these discussions shall be on the member's trade policies and practices, which are the subject of the assessment under the review mechanism.(iv) the tprb shall establish a basic plan for the conduct of the reviews. it may also discuss and take note of update reports from members. the tprb shall establish a programme of reviews for each year in consultation with the members directly concerned. in consultation with the member or members under review, the chairman may choose discussants who, acting in their personal capacity, shall introduce the discussions in the tprb.(v) the tprb shall base its work on the following documentation:(a) a full report, referred to in paragraph d, supplied by the member or members under review;(b) a report, to be drawn up by the secretariat on its own responsibility, based on the information available to it and that provided by the member or members concerned. the secretariat should seek clarification from the member or members concerned of their trade policies and practices.(vi) the reports by the member under review and by the secretariat, together with the minutes of the respective meeting of the tprb, shall be published promptly after the review.(vii) these documents will be forwarded to the ministerial conference, which shall take note of them.d. reportingin order to achieve the fullest possible degree of transparency, each member shall report regularly to the tprb. full reports shall describe the trade policies and practices pursued by the member or members concerned, based on an agreed format to be decided upon by the tprb. this format shall initially be based on the outline format for country reports established by the decision of 19 july 1989 (bisd 36s/406-409), amended as necessary to extend the coverage of reports to all aspects of trade policies covered by the multilateral trade agreements in annex 1 and, where applicable, the plurilateral trade agreements. this format may be revised by the tprb in the light of experience. between reviews, members shall provide brief reports when there are any significant changes in their trade policies; an annual update of statistical information will be provided according to the agreed format. particular account shall be taken of difficulties presented to least-developed country members in compiling their reports. the secretariat shall make available technical assistance on request to developing country members, and in particular to the least-developed country members. information contained in reports should to the greatest extent possible be coordinated with notifications made under provisions of the multilateral trade agreements and, where applicable, the plurilateral trade agreements.e. relationship with the balance-of-payments provisions of gatt 1994 and gatsmembers recognize the need to minimize the burden for governments also subject to full consultations under the balance-of-payments provisions of gatt 1994 or gats. to this end, the chairman of the tprb shall, in consultation with the member or members concerned, and with the chairman of the committee on balance-of-payments restrictions, devise administrative arrangements that harmonize the normal rhythm of the trade policy reviews with the timetable for balance-of-payments consultations but do not postpone the trade policy review by more than 12 months.f. appraisal of the mechanismthe tprb shall undertake an appraisal of the operation of the tprm not more than five years after the entry into force of the agreement establishing the wto. the results of the appraisal will be presented to the ministerial conference. it may subsequently undertake appraisals of the tprm at intervals to be determined by it or as requested by the ministerial conference.g. overview of developments in the international trading environmentan annual overview of developments in the international trading environment which are having an impact on the multilateral trading system shall also be undertaken by the tprb. the overview is to be assisted by an annual report by the director-general setting out major activities of the wto and highlighting significant policy issues affecting the trading system.[1] when "nationals" are referred to in this agreement, they shall be deemed, in the case of a separate customs territory member of the wto, to mean persons, natural or legal, who are domiciled or who have a real and effective industrial or commercial

countries and the need to ensure their effective participation in the world trading system, and to take further measures to improve their trading opportunities;recognizing the specific needs of the least-developed countries in the area of market access where continued preferential access remains an essential means for improving their trading opportunities;reaffirming their commitment to implement fully the provisions concerning the least-developed countries contained in paragraphs 2(d), 6 and 8 of the decision of 28 november 1979 on differential and more favourable treatment, reciprocity and fuller participation of developing countries;having regard to the commitment of the participants as set out in section b (vii) of part i of the punta del este ministerial declaration;1. decide that, if not already provided for in the instruments negotiated in the course of the uruguay round, notwithstanding their acceptance of these instruments, the least-developed countries, and for so long as they remain in that category, while complying with the general rules set out in the aforesaid instruments, will only be required to undertake commitments and concessions to the extent consistent with their individual development, financial and trade needs, or their administrative and institutional capabilities. the least-developed countries shall be given additional time of one year from 15 april 1994 to submit their schedules as required in article xi of the agreement establishing the world trade organization.2. agree that:(i) expeditious implementation of all special and differential measures taken in favour of least-developed countries including those taken within the context of the uruguay round shall be ensured through, inter alia, regular reviews.(ii) to the extent possible, mfn concessions on tariff and non-tariff measures agreed in the uruguay round on products of export interest to the least-developed countries may be implemented autonomously, in advance and without staging. consideration shall be given to further improve gsp and other schemes for products of particular export interest to least-developed countries.(iii) the rules set out in the various agreements and instruments and the transitional provisions in the uruguay round should be applied in a flexible and supportive manner for the least-developed countries. to this effect, sympathetic consideration shall be given to specific and motivated concerns raised by the least-developed countries in the appropriate councils and committees.(iv) in the application of import relief measures and other measures referred to in paragraph 3(c) of article xxxvii of gatt 1947 and the corresponding provision of gatt 1994, special consideration shall be given to the export interests of least-developed countries.(v) least-developed countries shall be accorded substantially increased technical assistance in the development, strengthening and diversification of their production and export bases including those of services, as well as in trade promotion, to enable them to maximize the benefits from liberalized access to markets.3. agree to keep under review the specific needs of the least-developed countries and to continue to seek the adoption of positive measures which facilitate the expansion of trading opportunities in favour of these countries.declaration on the contribution of the world trade organization to achieving greater coherence in global economic policymaking1. ministers recognize that the globalization of the world economy has led to ever-growing interactions between the economic policies pursued by individual countries, including interactions between the structural, macroeconomic, trade, financial and development aspects of economic policymaking. the task of achieving harmony between these policies falls primarily on governments at the national level, but their coherence internationally is an important and valuable element in increasing the effectiveness of these policies at national level. the agreements reached in the uruguay round show that all the participating governments recognize the contribution that liberal trading policies can make to the healthy growth and development of their own economies and of the world economy as a whole.2. successful cooperation in each area of economic policy contributes to progress in other areas. greater exchange rate stability, based on more orderly underlying economic and financial conditions, should contribute towards the expansion of trade, sustainable growth and development, and the correction of external imbalances. there is also a need for an adequate and timely flow of concessional and non-concessional financial and real investment resources to developing countries and for further efforts to address debt problems, to help ensure economic growth and development. trade liberalization forms an increasingly important component in the success of the adjustment programmes that many countries are undertaking, often involving significant transitional social costs. in this connection, ministers note the role of the world bank and the imf in supporting adjustment to trade liberalization, including support to net food-importing developing countries facing short-term costs arising from agricultural trade reforms.3. the positive outcome of the uruguay round is a major contribution towards more coherent and complementary international economic policies. the results of the uruguay round ensure an expansion of market access to the benefit of all countries, as well as a framework of strengthened multilateral disciplines for trade. they also guarantee that trade policy will be conducted in a more transparent manner and with greater awareness of the benefits for domestic competitiveness of an open trading environment. the strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the uruguay round has the capacity to provide an improved forum for liberalization, to contribute to more effective surveillance, and to ensure strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines. these improvements mean that trade policy can in the future play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policymaking.4. ministers recognize, however, that difficulties the origins of which lie outside the trade field cannot be redressed through measures taken in the trade field alone. this underscores the importance of efforts to improve other elements of global economic policymaking to complement the effective implementation of the results achieved in the uruguay round.5. the interlinkages between the different aspects of economic policy require that the international institutions with responsibilities in each of these areas follow consistent and mutually supportive policies. the world trade organization should therefore pursue and develop cooperation with the international organizations responsible for monetary and financial matters, while respecting the mandate, the confidentiality requirements and the necessary autonomy in decision-making procedures of each institution, and avoiding the imposition on governments of cross-conditionality or additional conditions. ministers further invite the director-general of the wto to review with the managing director of the international monetary fund and the president of the world bank, the implications of the wto's responsibilities for its cooperation with the bretton woods institutions, as well as the forms such cooperation might take, with a view to achieving greater coherence in global economic policymaking.decision on notification proceduresministers decide to recommend adoption by the ministerial conference of the decision on improvement and review of notification procedures set out below.members,desiring to improve the operation of notification procedures under the agreement establishing the world trade organization (hereinafter referred to as the "wto agreement"), and thereby to contribute to the transparency of members' trade policies and to the effectiveness of surveillance arrangements established to that end;recalling obligations under the wto agreement to publish and notify, including obligations assumed under the terms of specific protocols of accession, waivers, and other agreements entered into by members;agree as follows:i. general obligation to notifymembers affirm their commitment to obligations under the multilateral trade agreements and, where applicable, the plurilateral trade agreements, regarding publication and notification.members recall their undertakings set out in the understanding regarding notification, consultation, dispute settlement and surveillance adopted on 28 november 1979 (bisd 26s/210). with regard to their undertaking therein to notify, to the maximum extent possible, their adoption of trade measures affecting the operation of gatt 1994, such notification itself being without prejudice to views on the consistency of measures with or their relevance to rights and obligations under the multilateral trade agreements and, where applicable, the plurilateral trade agreements, members agree to be guided, as appropriate, by the annexed list of measures. members therefore agree that the introduction or modification of such measures is subject to the notification requirements of the 1979 understanding.ii. central registry of notificationsa central registry of notifications shall be established under the responsibility of the secretariat. while members will continue to follow existing notification procedures, the secretariat shall ensure that the central registry records such elements of the information provided on the measure by the member concerned as its purpose, its trade coverage, and the requirement under which it has been notified. the central registry shall cross-reference its records of notifications by member and obligation.the central registry shall inform each member annually of the regular notification obligations to which that member will be expected to respond in the course of the following year.the central registry shall draw the attention of individual members to regular notification requirements which remain unfulfilled.information in the central registry regarding individual notifications shall be made available on request to any member entitled to receive the notification concerned.iii. review of notification obligations and proceduresthe council for trade in goods will undertake a review of notification obligations and procedures under the agreements in annex 1a of the wto agreement. the review will be carried out by a working group, membership in which will be open to all members. the group will be established immediately after the date of entry into force of the wto agreement.the terms of reference of the working group will be:- to undertake a thorough review of all existing notification obligations of members established under the agreements in annex 1a of the wto agreement, with a view to simplifying, standardizing and consolidating these obligations to the greatest extent practicable, as well as to improving compliance with these obligations, bearing in mind the overall objective of improving the transparency of the trade policies of members and the effectiveness of surveillance arrangements established to this end, and also bearing in mind the possible need of some developing country members for assistance in meeting their notification obligations;- to make recommendations to the council for trade in goods not later than two years after the entry into force of the wto agreement ANNEX indicative list[1] of notifiable measurestariffs

1947 and the international monetary fund, and the provisions of the gatt 1947 governing that relationship, in particular article xv of the gatt 1947;recognizing the desire of participants to base the relationship of the world trade organization with the international monetary fund, with regard to the areas covered by the multilateral trade agreements in annex 1a of the wto agreement, on the provisions that have governed the relationship of the contracting parties to the gatt 1947 with the international monetary fund;hereby reaffirm that, unless otherwise provided for in the final act, the relationship of the wto with the international monetary fund, with regard to the areas covered by the multilateral trade agreements in annex 1a of the wto agreement, will be based on the provisions that have governed the relationship of the contracting parties to the gatt 1947 with the international monetary fund.decision on measures concerning the possible negative effects of the reform programme on least-developed andnet food-importing developing countries1. ministers recognize that the progressive implementation of the results of the uruguay round as a whole will generate increasing opportunities for trade expansion and economic growth to the benefit of all participants.2. ministers recognize that during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture least-developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions, including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs.3. ministers accordingly agree to establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the implementation of the results of the uruguay round on trade in agriculture does not adversely affect the availability of food aid at a level which is sufficient to continue to provide assistance in meeting the food needs of developing countries, especially least-developed and net food-importing developing countries. to this end ministers agree:(i) to review the level of food aid established periodically by the committee on food aid under the food aid convention 1986 and to initiate negotiations in the appropriate forum to establish a level of food aid commitments sufficient to meet the legitimate needs of developing countries during the reform programme;(ii) to adopt guidelines to ensure that an increasing proportion of basic foodstuffs is provided

declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, adjusted in accordance with the provisions of article 8. if, after receiving further information, or in the absence of a response, the customs administration still has

the netherlands, new zealand, the kingdom of norway, pakistan, southern rhodesia, syria, the union of south africa, the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, and the united states of america:recognizing that their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavour should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living, ensuring full employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and effective demand, developing the full use of the resources of the world and expanding the production and exchange of goods,being desirous of contributing to these objectives by entering into reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to the substantial reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in international commerce,have through their representatives agreed as follows:part i ARTICLE igeneral most-favoured-nation treatment1. with respect to customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation or exportation or imposed on the international transfer of payments for imports or exports, and with respect to the method of levying such duties and charges, and with respect to all rules and formalities in connection with importation and exportation, and with respect to all matters referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of article iii,[*] any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity granted by any contracting party to any product originating in or destined for any other country shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the like product originating in or destined for the territories of all other contracting parties.2. the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not require the elimination of any preferences in respect of import duties or charges which do not exceed the levels provided for in paragraph 4 of this article and which fall within the following descriptions:(a) preferences in force exclusively between two or more of the territories listed in annex a, subject to the conditions set forth therein;(b) preferences in force exclusively between two or more territories which on 1 july 1939, where connected by

united states of america and the republic of cuba;(d) preferences in force exclusively between neighbouring countries listed in annexes e and f.3. the provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to preferences between the countries formerly a part of the ottoman empire and detached from it on 24 july 1923, provided such preferences are approved under paragraph 5 of article xxv, which shall be applied in this respect in the light of paragraph 1 of article xxix.4. the margin of preference* on any product in respect of which a preference is permitted under paragraph 2 of this article but is not specifically set forth as a maximum margin of preference in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement shall not exceed:(a) in respect of duties or charges on any product described in such schedule, the difference between the most-favoured-nation and preferential rates provided for therein; if no preferential rate is provided for, the preferential rate shall for the purposes of this paragraph be taken to be that in force on 10 april 1947, and, if no most-favoured-nation rate is provided for, the margin shall not exceed the difference between the most-favoured-nation and preferential rates existing on 10 april 1947;(b) in respect of duties or charges on any product not described in the appropriate schedule, the difference between the most-favoured-nation and preferential rates existing on 10 april 1947.in the case of the contracting parties named in annex g, the date of 10 april 1947, referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be replaced by the respective dates set forth in that annex ARTICLE iischedules of concessions1. (a) each contracting party shall accord to the commerce of the other contracting parties treatment no less favourable than that provided for in the appropriate part of the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement.[2](b) the products described in part i of the schedule relating to any contracting party, which are the products of territories of other contracting parties, shall, on their importation into the territory to which the schedule relates, and subject to the terms, conditions or qualifications set forth in that schedule, be exempt from ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth and provided for therein. such products shall also be exempt from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation in excess of those imposed on the date of this agreement or those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed thereafter by legislation in force in the importing territory on that date.(c) the products described in part ii of the schedule relating to any contracting party which are the products of territories entitled under article i to receive preferential treatment upon importation into the territory to which the schedule relates shall, on their importation into such territory, and subject to the terms, conditions or qualifications set forth in that schedule, be exempt from ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth and provided for in part ii of that schedule. such products shall also be exempt from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation in excess of those imposed on the date of this agreement or those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed thereafter by legislation in force in the importing territory on that date. nothing in this article shall prevent any contracting party from maintaining its requirements existing on the date of this agreement as to the eligibility of goods for entry at preferential rates of duty.2. nothing in this article shall prevent any contracting party from imposing at any time on the importation of any product:(a) a charge equivalent to an internal tax imposed consistently with the provisions of paragraph 2 of article iii* in respect of the like domestic product or in respect of an article from which the imported product has been manufactured or produced in whole or in part;(b) any anti-dumping or countervailing duty applied consistently with the provisions of article vi;*(c) fees or other charges commensurate with the cost of services rendered.3. no contracting party shall alter its method of determining dutiable value or of converting currencies so as to impair the value of any of the concessions provided for in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement.4. if any contracting party establishes, maintains or authorizes, formally or in effect, a monopoly of the importation of any product described in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement, such monopoly shall not, except as provided for in that schedule or as otherwise agreed between the parties which initially negotiated the concession, operate so as to afford protection on the average i n excess of the amount of protection provided for in that schedule. the provisions of this paragraph shall not limit the use by contracting parties of any form of assistance to domestic producers permitted by other provisions of this agreement.*5. if any contracting party considers that a product is not receiving from another contracting party the treatment which the first contracting party believes to have been contemplated by a concession provided for in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement, it shall bring the matter directly to the attention of the other contracting party. if the latter agrees that the treatment contemplated was that claimed by the first contracting party, but declares that such treatment cannot be accorded because a court or other proper authority has ruled to the effect that the product involved cannot be classified under the tariff laws of such contracting party so as to permit the treatment contemplated in this agreement, the two contracting parties, together with any other contracting parties substantially interested, shall enter promptly into further negotiations with a view to a compensatory adjustment of the matter.6. (a) the specific duties and charges included in the schedules relating to contracting parties members of the international monetary fund, and margins of preference in specific duties and charges maintained by such contracting parties, are expressed in the appropriate currency at the par value accepted or provisionally recognized by the fund at the date of this agreement. accordingly, in case this par value is reduced consistently with the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund by more than twenty per centum, such specific duties and charges and margins of preference may be adjusted to take account of such reduction; provided that the contracting parties (ie. the contracting parties acting jointly as provided for in article xxv) concur that such adjustments will not impair the value of the concessions provided for in the appropriate schedule or elsewhere in this agreement, due account being taken of all factors which may influence the need for, or urgency of, such adjustments.(b) similar provisions shall apply to any contracting party not a member of the fund, as from the date on which such contracting party becomes a member of the fund or enters into a special exchange agreement in pursuance of article xv.7. the schedules annexed to this agreement are hereby made an integral part of part i of this agreement.part ii ARTICLE iii*national treatment on internal taxation and regulation1. the contracting parties recognize that internal taxes and other internal charges, and laws, regulations and requirements affecting the internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use of products, and internal quantitative regulations requiring the mixture, processing or use of products in specified amounts or proportions, should not be applied to imported or domestic products so as to afford protection to domestic production.*2. the products of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall not be subject, directly or indirectly, to internal taxes or other internal charges of any kind in excess of those applied, directly or indirectly, to like domestic products. moreover, no contracting party shall otherwise apply internal taxes or other internal charges to imported or domestic products in a manner contrary to the principles set forth in paragraph 1.*3. with respect to any existing internal tax which is inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph 2, but which is specifically authorized under a trade agreement, in force on 10 april 1947, in which the import duty on the taxed product is bound against increase, the contracting party imposing the tax shall be free to postpone the application of the provisions of paragraph 2 to such tax until such time as it can obtain release from the obligations of such trade agreement in order to permit the increase of such duty to the extent necessary to compensate for the elimination of the protective element of the tax.4. the products of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to like products of national origin in respect of all laws, regulations and requirements affecting their internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use. the provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent the application of differential internal transportation charges which are based exclusively on the economic operation of the means of transport and not on the nationality of the product.5. no contracting party shall establish or maintain any internal quantitative regulation relating to the mixture, processing or use of products in specified amounts or proportions which requires, directly or indirectly, that any specified amount or proportion of any product which is the subject of the regulation must be supplied from domestic sources. moreover, no contracting party shall otherwise apply internal quantitative regulations in a manner contrary to the principles set forth in paragraph 1.*6. the provisions of paragraph 5 shall not apply to any internal quantitative regulation in force in the territory of any contracting party on 1 july 1939, 10 april 1947, or 24 march 1948, at the option of that contracting party; provided that any such regulation which is contrary to the provisions of paragraph 5 shall not be modified to the detriment of imports and shall be treated as a customs duty for the purpose of negotiation.7. no internal quantitative regulation relating to the mixture, processing or use of products in specified amounts or proportions shall be applied in such a manner as to allocate any such amount or proportion among external sources of supply.8. (a) the provisions of this article shall not apply to laws, regulations or requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies of products purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods for commercial sale.(b) the provisions of this article shall not prevent the payment of subsidies exclusively to domestic producers, including payments to domestic producers derived from the proceeds of internal taxes or charges applied consistently with the provisions of this article and subsidies effected through governmental purchases of domestic products.9. the contracting parties recognize that internal maximum price control measures, even though conforming to the other provisions of this article, can have effects prejudicial to the interests of contracting parties supplying imported products. accordingly, contracting parties applying such measures shall take account of the interests of exporting contracting parties with a view to avoiding to the fullest practicable extent such prejudicial effects.10. the provisions of this article shall not prevent any contracting party from establishing or maintaining internal quantitative regulations relating to exposed cinematograph films and meeting the requirements of article iv ARTICLE ivspecial provisions relating to cinematograph filmsif any contracting party establishes or maintains internal quantitative regulations relating to exposed cinematograph films, such regulations shall take the form of screen quotas which shall conform to the following requirements;(a) screen quotas may require the exhibition of cinematograph films of national origin during a specified minimum proportion of the total screen time actually utilized, over a specified period of not less than one year, in the commercial exhibition of all films of whatever origin, and shall be computed on the basis of screen time per theatre per year or the equivalent thereof;(b) with the exception of screen time reserved for films of national origin under a screen quota, screen time including that released by administrative action from screen time reserved for films of national original, shall not be allocated formally or in effect among sources of supply;(c) notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) of this article, any contracting party may maintain screen quotas conforming to the requirements of sub-paragraph (a) of this article which reserve a minimum proportion of screen time for films of a specified origin other than that of the contracting party imposing such screen quotas; provided that no such minimum proportion of screen time shall be increased above the level in effect on 10 april 1947;(d) screen quotas shall be subject to negotiation for their limitation, liberalization or elimination ARTICLE vfreedom of transit1. goods (including baggage), and also vessels and other means of transport, shall be deemed to be in transit across the territory of a contracting party when the passage across such territory, with or without trans-shipment, warehousing, breaking bulk, or change in the mode of transport, is only a portion of a complete journey beginning and terminating beyond the frontier of the contracting party across whose territory the traffic passes. traffic of this nature is termed in this article "traffic in transit".2. there shall be freedom of transit through the territory of each contracting party, via the routes most convenient for international transit, for traffic in transit to or from the territory of other contracting parties. no distinction shall be made which is based on the flag of vessels, the place of origin, departure, entry, exit or destination, or on any circumstances relating to the ownership of goods, of vessels or of other means of transport.3. any contracting party may require that traffic in transit through its territory be entered at the proper custom house, but, except in cases of failure to comply with applicable customs laws and regulations, such traffic coming from or going to the territory of other contracting parties shall not be subject to any unnecessary delays or restrictions and shall be exempt from customs duties and from all transit duties or other charges imposed in respect of transit, except charges for transportation or those commensurate with administrative expenses entailed by transit or with the cost of services rendered.4. all charges and regulations imposed by contracting parties on traffic in transit to or from the territories of other contracting parties shall be reasonable, having regard to the conditions of the traffic.5. with respect to all charges, regulations and formalities in connection with transit, each contracting party shall accord to traffic in transit to or from the territory of any other contracting party treatment no less favourable than the treatment accorded to traffic in transit to or from any third country.*6. each contracting party shall accord to products which have been in transit through the territory of any other contracting party treatment no less favourable than that which would have been accorded to such products had they been transported from their place of origin to their destination without going through the territory of such other contracting party. any contracting party shall, however, be free to maintain its requirements of direct consignment existing on the date of this agreement, in respect of any goods in regard to which such direct consignment is a requisite condition of eligibility for entry of the goods at preferential rates of duty or has relation to the contracting party's prescribed method of valuation for duty purposes.7. the provisions of this article shall not apply to the operation of aircraft in transit, but shall apply to air transit of goods (including baggage) ARTICLE vianti-dumping and countervailing duties1. the contracting parties recognize that dumping, by which products of one country are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than the normal value of the products, is to be condemned if it causes or threatens material injury to an established industry in the territory of a contracting party or materially retards the establishment of a domestic industry. for the purposes of this article, a product is to be considered as being introduced into the commerce of an importing country at less than its normal value, if the price of the product exported from one country to another(a) is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country, or,(b) in the absence of such domestic price, is less than either(i) the highest comparable price for the like product for export to any third country in the ordinary course of trade, or(ii) the cost of production of the product in the country of origin plus a reasonable addition for selling cost and profit.due allowance shall be made in each case for differences in conditions and terms of sale, for differences in taxation, and for other differences affecting price comparability.*2. in order to offset or prevent dumping, a contracting party may levy on any dumped product an anti-dumping duty not greater in amount than the margin of dumping in respect of such product. for the purposes of this article, the margin of dumping is the price difference determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1.*3. no countervailing duty shall be levied on any product of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of another contracting party in excess of an amount equal to the estimated bounty or subsidy determined to have been granted, directly or indirectly, on the manufacture, production or export of such product in the country of origin or exportation, including any special subsidy to the transportation of a particular product. the term "countervailing duty" shall be understood to mean a special duty levied for the purpose of offsetting any bounty or subsidy bestowed, directly or indirectly, upon the manufacture, production or export of any merchandise.*4. no product of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall be subject to anti-dumping or countervailing duty by reason of the exemption of such product from duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for consumption in the country of origin or exportation, or by reason of the refund of such duties or taxes.5. no product of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation of dumping or export subsidization.6. (a) no contracting party shall levy any anti-dumping or countervailing duty on the importation of any product of the territory of another contracting party unless it determines that the effect of the dumping or subsidization, as the case may be, in such as to cause or threaten material injury to an established domestic industry, or is such as to retard materially the establishment of a domestic industry.(b) the contracting parties may waive the requirement of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph so as to permit a contracting party to levy an anti-dumping or countervailing duty on the importation of any product for the purpose of offsetting dumping or subsidization which causes or threatens material injury to an industry in the territory of another contracting party exporting the product concerned to the territory of the importing contracting party. the contracting parties shall waive the requirements of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, so as to permit the levying of a countervailing duty, in cases in which they find that a subsidy is causing or threatening material injury to an industry in the territory of another contracting party exporting the product concerned to the territory of the importing contracting party.*(c) in exceptional circumstances, however, where delay might cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a contracting party may levy a countervailing duty for the purpose referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph without the prior approval of the contracting parties; provided that such action shall be reported immediately to the contracting parties and that the countervailing duty shall be withdrawn promptly if the contracting parties disapprove.7. a system for the stabilization of the domestic price or of the return to domestic producers of a primary commodity, independently of the movements of export prices, which results at times in the sale of the commodity for export at a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like commodity to buyers in the domestic market, shall be presumed not to result in material injury within the meaning of paragraph 6 if it is determined by consultation among the contracting parties substantially interested in the commodity concerned that:(a) the system has also resulted in the sale of the commodity for export at a price higher than the comparable price charged for the like commodity to buyers in the domestic market, and(b) the system is so operated, either because of the effective regulation of production, or otherwise, as not to stimulate exports unduly or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of other contracting parties ARTICLE viivaluation for customs purposes1. the contracting parties recognize the validity of the general principles of valuation set forth in the following paragraphs of this article, and they undertake to give effect to such principles, in respect of all products subject to duties or other charges* or restrictions on importation and exportation based upon or regulated in any manner by value. moreover, they shall, upon a request by another contracting party review the operation of any of their laws or regulations relating to value for customs purposes in the light of these principles. the contracting parties may request from contracting parties reports on steps taken by them in pursuance of the provisions of this article.2. (a) the value for customs purposes of imported merchandise should be based on the actual value of the imported merchandise on which duty is assessed, or of like merchandise, and should not be based on the value of merchandise of national original or on arbitrary or fictitious values.*(b) "actual value" should be the price at which, at a time and place determined by the legislation of the country of importation, such or like merchandise is sold or offered for sale in the ordinary course of trade under fully competitive conditions. to the extent to which the price of such or like merchandise is governed by the quantity in a particular transaction, the price to be considered should uniformly be related to either (i) comparable quantities, or (ii) quantities not less favourable to importers than those in which the greater volume of the merchandise is sold in the trade between the countries of exportation and importation.*(c) when the actual value is not ascertainable in accordance with sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph, the value for customs purposes should be based on the nearest ascertainable equivalent of such value.*3. the value for customs purposes of any imported product should not include the amount of any internal tax, applicable within the country of origin or export, from which the imported product has been exempted or has been or will be relieved by means of refund.4. (a) except as otherwise provided for in this paragraph, where it is necessary for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this article for a contracting party to convert into its own currency a price expressed in the currency of another country, the conversion rate of exchange to be used shall be based, for each currency involved, on the par value as established pursuant to the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund or on the rate of exchange recognized by the fund, or on the par value established in accordance with a special exchange agreement entered into pursuant to article xv of this agreement.(b) where no such established par value and no such recognized rate of exchange exist, the conversion rate shall reflect effectively the current value of such currency in commercial transactions.(c) the contracting parties, in agreement with the international monetary fund, shall formulate rules governing the conversion by contracting parties of any foreign currency in respect of which multiple rates of exchange are maintained consistently with the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund. any contracting party may apply such rules in respect of such foreign currencies for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this article as an alternative to the use of par values. until such rules are adopted by the contracting parties, any contracting party may employ, in respect of any such foreign currency, rules of conversion for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this article which are designed to reflect effectively the value of such foreign currency in commercial transactions.(d) nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require any contracting party to alter the method of converting currencies for customs purposes which is applicable in its territory on the date of this agreement, if such alteration would have the effect of increasing generally the amounts of duty payable.5. the bases and methods for determining the value of products subject to duties or other charges or restrictions based upon or regulated in any manner by value should be stable and should be given sufficient publicity to enable traders to estimate, with a reasonable degree of certainty, the value for customs purposes ARTICLE viiifees and formalities connected with importation and exportation*1. (a) all fees and charges of whatever character (other than import and export duties and other than taxes within the purview of article iii) imposed by contracting parties on or in connexion with importation or exportation shall be limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered and shall not represent an indirect protection to domestic products or a taxation of imports or exports for fiscal purposes.(b) the contracting parties recognize the need for reducing the number and diversity of fees and charges referred to in sub-paragraph (a).(c) the contracting parties also recognize the need for minimizing the incidence and complexity of import and export formalities and for decreasing and simplifying import and export documentation requirements.*2. a contracting party shall, upon request by another contracting party or by the contracting parties, review the operation of its laws and regulations in the light of the provisions of this article.3. no contracting party shall impose substantial penalties for minor breaches of customs regulations or procedural requirements. in particular, no penalty in respect of any omission or mistake in customs documentation which is easily rectifiable and obviously made without fraudulent intent or gross negligence shall be greater than necessary to serve merely as a warning.4. the provisions of this article shall extend to fees, charges, formalities and requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connexion with importation and exportation, including those relating to:(a) consular transactions, such as consular invoices and certificates;(b) quantitative restrictions;(c) licensing;(d) exchange control;(e) statistical services;(f) documents, documentation and certification;(g) analysis and inspection; and(h) quarantine, sanitation and fumigation ARTICLE ixmarks of origin1. each contracting party shall accord to the products of the territories of other contracting parties treatment with regard to marking requirements no less favourable than the treatment accorded to like products of any third country.2. the contracting parties recognize that, in adopting and enforcing laws and regulations relating to marks of origin, the difficulties and inconveniences which such measures may cause to the commerce and industry of exporting countries should be reduced to a minimum, due regard being had to the necessity of protecting consumers against fraudulent or misleading indications.3. whenever it is administratively practicable to do so, contracting parties should permit required marks of origin to be affixed at the time of importation.4. the laws and regulations of contracting parties relating to the marking of imported products shall be such as to permit compliance without seriously damaging the products, or materially reducing their value, or unreasonably increasing their cost.5. as a general rule, no special duty or penalty should be imposed by any contracting party for failure to comply with marking requirements prior to importation unless corrective marking is unreasonably delayed or deceptive marks have been affixed or the required marking has been intentionally omitted.6. the contracting parties shall co-operate with each other with a view to preventing the use of trade names in such manner as to misrepresent the true origin of a product, to the detriment of such distinctive regional or geographical names of products of the territory of a contracting party as are protected by its legislation. each contracting party shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such requests or representations as may be made by any other contracting party regarding the application of the undertaking set forth in the preceding sentence to names of products which have been communicated to it by the other contracting party ARTICLE xpublication and administration of trade regulations1. laws, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application, made effective by any contracting party, pertaining to the classification or the valuation of products for customs purposes, or to rates of duty, taxes or other charges, or to requirements, restrictions or prohibitions on imports or exports or on the transfer of payments therefor, or affecting their sale, distribution, transportation, insurance, warehousing, inspection, exhibition, processing, mixing or other use, shall be published promptly in such a manner as to enable governments and traders to become acquainted with them. agreements affecting international trade policy which are in force between the government or a governmental agency of any contracting party and the government or governmental agency of any other contracting party shall also be published. the provisions of this paragraph shall not require any contracting party to disclose confidential information which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.2. no measure of general application taken by any contracting party effecting an advance in a rate of duty or other charge on imports under an established and uniform practice, or imposing a new or more burdensome requirement, restriction or prohibition on imports, or on the transfer of payments therefor, shall be enforced before such measure has been officially published.3. (a) each contracting party shall administer in a uniform, impartial and reasonable manner all its laws, regulations, decisions and rulings of the kind described in paragraph 1 of this article.(b) each contracting party shall maintain, or institute as soon as practicable, judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures for the purpose, inter alia, of the prompt review and correction of administrative action relating to customs matters. such tribunals or procedures shall be independent of the agencies entrusted with administrative enforcement and their decisions shall be implemented by, and shall govern the practice of, such agencies unless an appeal is lodged with a court or tribunal of superior jurisdiction within the time prescribed for appeals to be lodged by importers; provided that the central administration of such agency may take steps to obtain a review of the matter in another proceeding if there is good cause to believe that the decision is inconsistent with established principles of law or the actual facts.(c) the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph, shall not require the elimination or substitution of procedures in force in the territory of a contracting party on the date of this agreement which in fact provide for an objective and impartial review of administrative action even though such procedures are not fully or formally independent of the agencies entrusted with administrative enforcement. any contracting party employing such procedures shall, upon request, furnish the contracting parties with full information thereon in order that they may determine whether such procedures conform to the requirements of this sub-paragraph ARTICLE xi*general elimination of quantitative restrictions1. no prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licences or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation or sale for export of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party.2. the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not extend to the following:(a) export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent or relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting contracting party;(b) import and export prohibitions or restrictions necessary to the application of standards or regulations for the classification, grading or marketing of commodities in international trade;(c) import restrictions on any agricultural or fisheries product, imported in any form,* necessary to the enforcement of governmental measures which operate:(i) to restrict the quantities of the like domestic product permitted to be marketed or produced, or, if there is no substantial domestic production of the like product, of a domestic product for which the imported product can be directly substituted; or(ii) to remove a temporary surplus of the like domestic product, or, if there is no substantial domestic production of the like product, of a domestic product for which the imported product can be directly substituted, by making the surplus available to certain groups of domestic consumers free of charge or at prices below the current market level; or(iii) to restrict the quantities permitted to be produced of any animal product the production of which is directly dependent, wholly or mainly, on the imported commodity, if the domestic production of that commodity is relatively negligible.any contracting party applying restrictions on the importation of any product pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph shall give public notice of the total quantity or value of the product permitted to be imported during a specified future period and of any change in such quantity or value. moreover, any restrictions applied under (i) above shall not be such as will reduce the total of imports relative to the total of domestic production, as compared with the proportion which might reasonably be expected to rule between the two in the absence of restrictions. in determining this proportion, the contracting party shall pay due regard to the proportion prevailing during a previous representative period and to any special factors* which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the product concerned ARTICLE xii*restrictions to safeguard the balance of payments1. notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of article xi, any contracting party, in order to safeguard its external financial position and its balance of payments, may restrict the quantity or value of merchandise permitted to be imported, subject to the provisions of the following paragraphs of this article.2. (a) import restrictions instituted, maintained or intensified by a contracting party under this article shall not exceed those necessary:(i) to forestall the imminent threat of, or to stop, a serious decline in its monetary reserves, or(ii) in the case of a contracting party with very low monetary reserves, to achieve a reasonable rate of increase in its reserves.due regard shall be paid in either case to any special factors which may be affecting the reserves of such contracting party or its need for reserves, including, where special external credits or other resources are available to it, the need to provide for the appropriate use of such credits or resources.(b) contracting parties applying restrictions under sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall progressively relax them as such conditions improve, maintaining them only to the extent that the conditions specified in that sub-paragraph still justify their application. they shall eliminate the restrictions when conditions would no longer justify their institution or maintenance under that sub-paragraph.3. (a) contracting parties undertake, in carrying out their domestic policies, to pay due regard to the need for maintaining or restoring equilibrium in their balance of payments on a sound and lasting basis and to the desirability of avoiding an uneconomic employment of productive resources. they recognize that, in order to achieve these ends, it is desirable so far as possible to adopt measures which expand rather than contract international trade.(b) contracting parties applying restrictions under this article may determine the incidence of the restrictions on imports of different products or classes of products in such a way as to give priority to the importation of those products which are more essential.(c) contracting parties applying restrictions under this article undertake:(i) to avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial or economic interests of any other contracting party;*(ii) not to apply restrictions so as to prevent unreasonably the importation of any description of goods in minimum commercial quantities the exclusion of which would impair regular channels of trade; and(iii) not to apply restrictions which would prevent the importation of commercial samples or prevent compliance with patent, trade mark, copyright, or similar procedures.(d) the contracting parties recognize that, as a result of domestic policies directed towards the achievement and maintenance of full and productive employment or towards the development of economic resources, a contracting party may experience a high level of demand for imports involving a threat to its monetary reserves of the sort referred to in paragraph 2(a) of this article. accordingly, a contracting party otherwise complying with the provisions of this article shall not be required to withdraw or modify restrictions on the ground that a change in those policies would render unnecessary restrictions which it is applying under this article.4. (a) any contracting party applying new restrictions or raising the general level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification of the measures applied under this article shall immediately after instituting or intensifying such restrictions (or, in circumstances in which prior consultation is practicable, before doing so) consult with the contracting parties as to the nature of its balance of payments difficulties, alternative corrective measures which may be available, and the possible effect of the restrictions on the economies of other contracting parties.(b) on a date to be determined by them,* the contracting parties shall review all restrictions still applied under this article on that date. beginning one year after that date, contracting parties applying import restrictions under this article shall enter into consultations of the type provided for in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph with the contracting parties annually.(c) (i) if, in the course of consultations with a contracting party under sub-paragraph (a) or (b) above, the contracting parties find that the restrictions are not consistent with the provisions of this article or with those of article xiii (subject to the provisions of article xiv), they shall indicate the nature of the inconsistency and may advise that the restrictions be suitably modified.(ii) if, however, as a result of the consultations, the contracting parties determine that the restrictions are being applied in a manner involving an inconsistency of a serious nature with the provisions of this article or with those of article xiii (subject to the provisions of article xiv) and that damage to the trade of any contracting party is caused or threatened thereby, they shall so inform the contracting party applying the restrictions and shall make appropriate recommendations for securing conformity with such provisions within a specified period of time. if such contracting party does not comply with these recommendations within the specified period, the contracting parties may release any contracting party the trade of which is adversely affected by the restrictions from such obligations under this agreement towards the contracting party applying the restrictions as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.(d) the contracting parties shall invite any contracting party which is applying restrictions under this article to enter into consultations with them at the request of any contracting party which can establish a prima facie case that the restrictions are inconsistent with the provisions of this article or with those of article xiii (subject to the provisions of article xiv) and that its trade is adversely affected thereby. however, no such invitation shall be issued unless the contracting parties have ascertained that direct discussions between the contracting parties concerned have not been successful. if, as a result of the consultations with the contracting parties, no agreement is reached and they determine that the restrictions are being applied inconsistently with such provisions, and that damage to the trade of the contracting party initiating the procedure is caused or threatened thereby, they shall recommend the withdrawal or modification of the restrictions. if the restrictions are not withdrawn or modified within such time as the contracting parties may prescribe, they may release the contracting party initiating the procedure from such obligations under this agreement towards the contracting party applying the restrictions as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.(e) in proceeding under this paragraph, the contracting parties shall have due regard to any special external factors adversely affecting the export trade of the contracting party applying restrictions.*(f) determinations under this paragraph shall be rendered expeditiously and, if possible, within sixty days of the initiation of the consultations.5. if there is a persistent and widespread application of import restrictions under this article, indicating the existence of a general disequilibrium which is restricting international trade, the contracting parties shall initiate discussions to consider whether other measures might be taken, either by those contracting parties the balances of payments of which are under pressure or by those the balances of payments of which are tending to be exceptionally favourable, or by any appropriate intergovernmental organization, to remove the underlying causes of the disequilibrium. on the invitation of the contracting parties, contracting parties shall participate in such discussions ARTICLE xiii*non-discriminatory admission of quantitative restrictions1. no prohibition or restriction shall be applied by any contracting party on the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party, unless the importation of the like product of all third countries or the exportation of the like product to all third countries is similarly prohibited or restricted.2. in applying import restrictions to any product, contracting parties shall aim at a distribution of trade in such product approaching as closely as possible the shares which the various contracting parties might be expected to obtain in the absence of such restrictions, and to this end shall observe the following provisions:(a) wherever practicable, quotas representing the total amount of permitted imports (whether allocated among supplying countries or not) shall be fixed, and notice given of their amount in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of this article;(b) in cases in which quotas are not practicable, the restrictions may be applied by means of import licences or permits without a quota;(c) contracting parties shall not, except for purposes of operating quotas allocated in accordance with sub-paragraph (d) of this paragraph, require that import licences or permits be utilized for the importation of the product concerned from a particular country or source;(d) in cases in which a quota is allocated among supplying countries, the contracting party applying the restrictions may seek agreement with respect to the allocation of shares in the quota with all other contracting parties having a substantial interest in supplying the product concerned. in cases in which this method is not reasonably practicable, the contracting party concerned shall allot to contracting parties having a substantial interest in supplying the product shares based upon the proportions, supplied by such contracting parties during a previous representative period, of the total quantity or value of imports of the product, due account being taken of any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the product. no conditions or formalities shall be imposed which would prevent any contracting party from utilizing fully the share of any such total quantity or value which has been allotted to it, subject to importation being made within any prescribed period to which the quota may relate.*3. (a) in cases in which import licences are issued in connection with import restrictions, the contracting party applying the restrictions shall provide, upon the request of any contracting party having an interest in the trade in the product concerned, all relevant information concerning the administration of the restrictions, the import licences granted over a recent period and the distribution of such licences among supplying countries; provided that there shall be no obligation to supply information as to the names of importing or supplying enterprises.(b) in the case of import restrictions involving the fixing of quotas, the contracting party applying the restrictions shall give public notice of the total quantity or value of the product or products which will be permitted to be imported during a specified future period and of any change in such quantity or value. any supplies of the product in question which were en route at the time at which public notice was given shall not be excluded from entry; provided that they may be counted so far as practicable, against the quantity permitted to be imported in the period in question, and also, where necessary, against the quantities permitted to be imported in the next following period or periods; and provided further that if any contracting party customarily exempts from such restrictions products entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption during a period of thirty days after the day of such public notice, such practice shall be considered full compliance with this sub-paragraph.(c) in the case of quotas allocated among supplying countries, the contracting party applying the restrictions shall promptly inform all other contracting parties having an interest in supplying the product concerned of the shares in the quota currently allocated, by quantity or value, to the various supplying countries and shall give public notice thereof.4. with regard to restrictions applied in accordance with paragraph 2(d) of this article or under paragraph 2(c) of article xi, the selection of a representative period for any product and the appraisal of any special factors* affecting the trade in the product shall be made initially by the contracting party applying the restriction; provided that such contracting party shall, upon the request of any other contracting party having a substantial interest in supplying that product or upon the request of the contracting parties, consult promptly with the other contracting party or the contracting parties regarding the need for an adjustment of the proportion determined or of the base period selected, or for the reappraisal of the special factors involved, or for the elimination of conditions, formalities or any other provisions established unilaterally relating to the allocation of an adequate quota or its unrestricted utilization.5. the provisions of this article shall apply to any tariff quota instituted or maintained by any contracting party, and, in so far as applicable, the principles of this article shall also extend to export restrictions ARTICLE xiv*exceptions to the rule of non-discrimination1. a contracting party which applies restrictions under article xii or under section b of article xviii may, in the application of such restrictions, deviate from the provisions of article xiii in a manner having equivalent effect to restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions which that contracting party may at that time apply under article viii or xiv of the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund, or under analogous provisions of a special exchange agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph 6 of article xv.*2. a contracting party which is applying import restrictions under article xii or under section b of article xviii may, with the consent of the contracting parties, temporarily deviate from the provisions of article xiii in respect of a small part of its external trade where the benefits to the contracting party or contracting parties concerned substantially outweigh any injury which may result to the trade of other contracting parties.*3. the provisions of article xiii shall not preclude a group of territories having a common quota in the international monetary fund from applying against imports from other countries, but not among themselves, restrictions in accordance with the provisions of article xii or of section b of article xviii on condition that such restrictions are in all other respects consistent with the provisions of article xiii.4. a contracting party applying import restrictions under article xii or under section b of article xviii shall not be precluded by articles xi to xv or section b of article xviii of this agreement from applying measures to direct its exports in such a manner as to increase its earnings of currencies which it can use without deviation from the provisions of article xiii.5. a contracting party shall not be precluded by articles xi to xv, inclusive, or by section b of article xviii, of this agreement from applying quantitative restrictions:(a) having equivalent effect to exchange restrictions authorized under section 3(b) of article vii of the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund, or(b) under the preferential arrangements provided for in annex a of this agreement, pending the outcome of the negotiations referred to therein ARTICLE xvexchange arrangements1. the contracting parties shall seek cooperation with the international monetary fund to the end that the contracting parties and the fund may pursue a coordinated policy with regard to exchange questions within the jurisdiction of the fund and questions of quantitative restrictions and other trade measures within the jurisdiction of the contracting parties.2. in all cases in which the contracting parties are called upon to consider or deal with problems concerning monetary reserves, balances of payments or foreign exchange arrangements, they shall consult fully with the international monetary fund. in such consultations, the contracting parties shall accept all findings of statistical and other facts presented by the fund relating to foreign exchange, monetary reserves and balances of payments, and shall accept the determination of the fund as to whether action by a contracting party in exchange matters is in accordance with the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund, or with the terms of a special exchange agreement between that contracting party and the contracting parties. the contracting parties, in reaching their final decision in cases involving the criteria set forth in paragraph 2(a) of article xii or in paragraph 9 of article xviii, shall accept the determination of the fund as to what constitutes a serious decline in the contracting party's monetary reserves, a very low level of its monetary reserves or a reasonable rate of increase in its monetary reserves, and to the financial aspects of other matters covered in consultation in such cases.3. the contracting parties shall seek agreement with the fund regarding procedures for consultation under paragraph 2 of this article.4. contracting parties shall not, by exchange action, frustrate* the intent of the provisions of this agreement, nor, by trade action, the intent of the provisions of the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund.5. if the contracting parties consider, at any time, that exchange restrictions on payments and transfers in connexion with imports are being applied by a contracting party in a manner inconsistent with the exceptions provided for in this agreement for quantitative restrictions, they shall report thereon to the fund.6. any contracting party which is not a member of the fund shall, within a time to be determined by the contracting parties after consultation with the fund, become a member of the fund, or, failing that, enter into a special exchange agreement with the contracting parties. a contracting party which ceases to be a member of the fund shall forthwith enter into a special exchange agreement with the contracting parties. any special exchange agreement entered into by a contracting party under this paragraph shall thereupon become part of its obligations under this agreement.7. (a) a special exchange agreement between a contracting party and the contracting parties under paragraph 6 of this article shall provide to the satisfaction of the contracting parties that the objectives of this agreement will not be frustrated as a result of action in exchange matters by the contracting party in question.(b) the terms of any such agreement shall not impose obligations on the contracting party in exchange matters generally more restrictive than those imposed by the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund on members of the fund.8. a contracting party which is not a member of the fund shall furnish such information within the general scope of section 5 of article viii of the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund as the contracting parties may require in order to carry out their functions under this agreement.9. nothing in this agreement shall preclude:(a) the use by a contracting party of exchange controls or exchange restrictions in accordance with the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund or with that contracting party's special exchange agreement with the contracting parties, or(b) the use by a contracting party of restrictions or controls on imports or exports, the sole effect of which, additional to the effects permitted under articles xi, xii, xiii and xiv, is to make effective such exchange controls or exchange restrictions ARTICLE xvi*subsidiessection a - subsidies in general1. if any contracting party grants or maintains any subsidy, including any form of income or price support, which operates directly or indirectly to increase exports of any product from, or to reduce imports of any product into, its territory, it shall notify the contracting parties in writing of the extent and nature of the subsidization, of the estimated effect of the subsidization on the quantity of the affected product or products imported into or exported from its territory and of the circumstances making the subsidization necessary. in any case in which it is determined that serious prejudice to the interests of any other contracting party is caused or threatened by any such subsidization, the contracting party granting the subsidy shall, upon request, discuss with the other contracting party or parties concerned, or with the contracting parties, the possibility of limiting the subsidization.section b - additional provisions on export subsidies*2. the contracting parties recognize that the granting by a contracting party of a subsidy on the export of any product may have harmful effects for other contracting parties, both importing and exporting, may cause undue disturbance to their normal commercial interests, and may hinder the achievement of the objectives of this agreement.3. accordingly, contracting parties should seek to avoid the use of subsidies on the export of primary products. if, however, a contracting party grants directly or indirectly any form of subsidy which operates to increase the export of any primary product from its territory, such subsidy shall not be applied in a manner which results in that contracting party having more than an equitable share of world export trade in that product, account being taken of the shares of the contracting parties in such trade in the product during a previous representative period, and any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting such trade in the product.*4. further, as from 1 january 1958 or the earliest practicable date thereafter, contracting parties shall cease to grant either directly or indirectly any form of subsidy on the export of any product other than a primary product which subsidy results in the sale of such product for export at a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic market. until 31 december 1957 no contracting party shall extend the scope of any such subsidization beyond that existing on 1 january 1955 by the introduction of new, or the extension of existing, subsidies.*5. the contracting parties shall review the operation of the provisions of this article from time to time with a view to examining its effectiveness, in the light of actual experience, in promoting the objectives of this agreement and avoiding subsidization seriously prejudicial to the trade or interests of contracting parties ARTICLE xviistate trading enterprises1.* (a) each contracting party undertakes that if it establishes or maintains a state enterprise, wherever located, or grants to any enterprise, formally or in effect, exclusive or special privileges,* such enterprise shall, in its purchases or sales involving either imports or exports, act in a manner consistent with the general principles of non-discriminatory treatment prescribed in this agreement for governmental measures affecting imports or exports by private traders.(b) the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall be understood to require that such enterprises shall, having due regard to the other provisions of this agreement, make any such purchases or sales solely in accordance with commercial considerations,* including price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation and other conditions of purchase or sale, and shall afford the enterprises of the other contracting parties adequate opportunity, in accordance with customary business practice, to compete for participation in such purchases or sales.(c) no contracting party shall prevent any enterprise (whether or not an enterprise described in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph) under its jurisdiction from acting in accordance with the principles of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph.2. the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not apply to imports of products for immediate or ultimate consumption in governmental use and not otherwise for resale or use in the production of goods* for sale. with respect to such imports, each contracting party shall accord to the trade of the other contracting parties fair and equitable treatment.3. the contracting parties recognize that enterprises of the kind described in paragraph 1(a) of this article might be operated so as to create serious obstacles to trade; thus negotiations on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis designed to limit or reduce such obstacles are of importance to the expansion of international trade.*4. (a) contracting parties shall notify the contracting parties of the products which are imported into or exported from their territories by enterprises of the kind described in paragraph 1(a) of this article.(b) a contracting party establishing, maintaining or authorizing an import monopoly of a product, which is not the subject of a concession under article ii, shall, on the request of another contracting party having a substantial trade in the product concerned, inform the contracting parties of the import mark-up* on the product during a recent representative period, or, when it is not possible to do so, of the price charged on the resale of the product.(c) the contracting parties may, at the request of a contracting party which has reason to believe that its interests under this agreement are being adversely affected by the operations of an enterprise of the kind described in paragraph 1(a), request the contracting party establishing, maintaining or authorizing such enterprise to supply information about its operations related to the carrying out of the provisions of this agreement.(d) the provisions of this paragraph shall not require any contracting party to disclose confidential information which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises ARTICLE xviii*governmental assistance to economic development1. the contracting parties recognize that the attainment of the objectives of this agreement will be facilitated by the progressive development of their economies, particularly of those contracting parties the economies of which can only support low standards of living* and are in the early stages of development.*2. the contracting parties recognize further that it may be necessary for those contracting parties, in order to implement programmes and policies of economic development designed to raise the general standard of living of their people, to take protective or other measures affecting imports, and that such measures are justified in so far as they facilitate the attainment of the objectives of this agreement. they agree, therefore, that those contracting parties should enjoy additional facilities to enable them (a) to maintain sufficient flexibility in their tariff structure to be able to grant the tariff protection required for the establishment of a particular industry* and (b) to apply quantitative restrictions for balance of payments purposes in a manner which takes full account of the continued high level of demand for imports likely to be generated by their programmes of economic development.3. the contracting parties recognize finally that, with those additional facilities which are provided for in sections a and b of this article, the provisions of this agreement would normally be sufficient to enable contracting parties to meet the requirements of their economic development. they agree, however, that there may be circumstances where no measure consistent with those provisions is practicable to permit a contracting party in the process of economic development to grant the governmental assistance required to promote the establishment of particular industries* with a view to raising the general standard of living of its people. special procedures are laid down in sections c and d of this article to deal with those cases.4. (a) consequently, a contracting party the economy of which can only support low standards of living* and is in the early stages of development* shall be free to deviate temporarily from the provisions of the other articles of this agreement, as provided in sections a, b and c of this article.(b) a contracting party the economy of which is in the process of development, but which does not come within the scope of sub-paragraph (a) above, may submit applications to the contracting parties under section d of this article.5. the contracting parties recognize that the export earnings of contracting parties, the economies of which are of the type described in paragraph 4(a) and (b) above and which depend on exports of a small number of primary commodities, may be seriously reduced by a decline in the sale of such commodities. accordingly, when the exports of primary commodities by such a contracting party are seriously affected by measures taken by another contracting party, it may have resort to the consultation provisions of article xxii of this agreement.6. the contracting parties shall review annually all measures applied pursuant to the provisions of sections c and d of this article.section a7. (a) if a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4(a) of this article considers it desirable, in order to promote the establishment of a particular industry* with a view to raising the general standard of living of its people, to modify or withdraw a concession included in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement, it shall notify the contracting parties to this effect and enter into negotiations with any contracting party with which such concession was initially negotiated, and with any other contracting party determined by the contracting parties to have a substantial interest therein. if agreement is reached between such contracting parties concerned, they shall be free to modify or withdraw concessions under the appropriate schedules to this agreement in order to give effect to such agreement, including any compensatory adjustments involved.(b) if agreement is not reached within sixty days after the notification provided for in sub-paragraph (a) above, the contracting party which proposes to modify or withdraw the concession may refer the matter to the contracting parties, which shall promptly examine it. if they find that the contracting party which proposes to modify or withdraw the concession has made every effort to reach an agreement and that the compensatory adjustment offered by it is adequate, that contracting party shall be free to modify or withdraw the concession if, at the same time, it gives effect to the compensatory adjustment. if the contracting parties do not find that the compensation offered by a contracting party proposing to modify or withdraw the concession is adequate, but find that it has made every reasonable effort to offer adequate compensation, that contracting party shall be free to proceed with such modification or withdrawal. if such action is taken, any other contracting party referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above shall be free to modify or withdraw substantially equivalent concessions initially negotiated with the contracting party which has taken the action.*section b8. the contracting parties recognize that contracting parties coming within the scope of paragraph 4(a) of this article tend, when they are in rapid process of development, to experience balance of payments difficulties arising mainly from efforts to expand their internal markets as well as from the instability in their terms of trade.9. in order to safeguard its external financial position and to ensure a level of reserves adequate for the implementation of its programme of economic development, a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4(a) of this article may, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 10 to 12, control the general level of its imports by restricting the quantity or value of merchandise permitted to be imported; provided that the import restrictions instituted, maintained or intensified shall not exceed those necessary:(a) to forestall the threat of, or to stop, a serious decline in its monetary reserves, or(b) in the case of a contracting party with inadequate monetary reserves, to achieve a reasonable rate of increase in its reserves.due regard shall be paid in either case to any special factors which may be affecting the reserves of the contracting party or its need for reserves, including, where special external credits or other resources are available to it, the need to provide for the appropriate use of such credits or resources.10. in applying these restrictions, the contracting party may determine their incidence on imports of different products or classes of products in such a way as to give priority to the importation of those products which are more essential in the light of its policy of economic development; provided that the restrictions are so applied as to avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial or economic interests of any other contracting party and not to prevent unreasonably the importation of any description of goods in minimum commercial quantities the exclusion of which would impair regular channels of trade; and provided further that the restrictions are not so applied as to prevent the importation of commercial samples or to prevent compliance with patent, trade mark, copyright or similar procedures.11. in carrying out its domestic policies, the contracting party concerned shall pay due regard to the need for restoring equilibrium in its balance of payments on a sound and lasting basis and to the desirability of assuring an economic employment of productive resources. it shall progressively relax any restrictions applied under this section as conditions improve, maintaining them only to the extent necessary under the terms of paragraph 9 of this article and shall eliminate them when conditions no longer justify such maintenance; provided that no contracting party shall be required to withdraw or modify restrictions on the ground that a change in its development policy would render unnecessary the restrictions which it is applying under this section.*12. (a) any contracting party applying new restrictions or raising the general level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification of the measures applied under this section, shall immediately after instituting or intensifying such restrictions (or, in circumstances in which prior consultation is practicable, before doing so) consult with the contracting parties as to the nature of its balance of payments difficulties, alternative corrective measures which may be available, and the possible effect of the restrictions on the economies of other contracting parties.(b) on a date to be determined by them,* the contracting parties shall review all restrictions still applied under this section on that date. beginning two years after that date, contracting parties applying restrictions under this section shall enter into consultations of the type provided for in sub-paragraph (a) above with the contracting parties at intervals of approximately, but not less than, two years according to a programme to be drawn up each year by the contracting parties; provided that no consultation under this sub-paragraph shall take place within two years after the conclusion of a consultation of a general nature under any other provision of this paragraph.(c) (i) if, in the course of consultations with a contracting party under sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph, the contracting parties find that the restrictions are not consistent with the provisions of this section or with those of article xiii (subject to the provisions of article xiv), they shall indicate the nature of the inconsistency and may advise that the restrictions be suitably modified.(ii) if, however, as a result of the consultations, the contracting parties determine that the restrictions are being applied in a manner involving an inconsistency of a serious nature with the provisions of this section or with those of article xiii (subject to the provisions of article xiv) and that damage to the trade of any contracting party is caused or threatened thereby, they shall so inform the contracting party applying the restrictions and shall make appropriate recommendations for securing conformity with such provisions within a specified period. if such contracting party does not comply with these recommendations within the specified period, the contracting parties may release any contracting party the trade of which is adversely affected by the restrictions from such obligations under this agreement towards the contracting party applying the restrictions as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.(d) the contracting parties shall invite any contracting party which is applying restrictions under this section to enter into consultations with them at the request of any contracting party which can establish a prima facie case that the restrictions are inconsistent with the provisions of this section or with those of article xiii (subject to the provisions of article xiv) and that its trade is adversely affected thereby. however, no such invitation shall be issued unless the contracting parties have ascertained that direct discussions between the contracting parties concerned have not been successful. if, as a result of the consultations with the contracting parties no agreement is reached and they determine that the restrictions are being applied inconsistently with such provisions, and that damage to the trade of the contracting party initiating the procedure is caused or threatened thereby, they shall recommend the withdrawal or modification of the restrictions. if the restrictions are not withdrawn or modified within such time as the contracting parties may prescribe, they may release the contracting party initiating the procedure from such obligations under this agreement towards the contracting party applying the restrictions as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.(e) if a contracting party against which action has been taken in accordance with the last sentence of sub-paragraph (c)(ii) or (d) of this paragraph, finds that the release of obligations authorized by the contracting parties adversely affects the operation of its programme and policy of economic development, it shall be free, not later than sixty days after such action is taken, to give written notice to the executive secretary[+] to the contracting parties of its intention to withdraw from this agreement and such withdrawal shall take effect on the sixtieth day following the day on which the notice is received by him.(f) in proceeding under this paragraph, the contracting parties shall have due regard to the factors referred to in paragraph 2 of this article. determinations under this paragraph shall be rendered expeditiously and, if possible, within sixty days of the initiation of the consultations.section c13. if a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4(a) of this article finds that governmental assistance is required to promote the establishment of a particular industry* with a view to raising the general standard of living of its people, but that no measure consistent with the other provisions of this agreement is practicable to achieve that objective, it may have recourse to the provisions and procedures set out in this section.*14. the contracting party concerned shall notify the contracting parties of the special difficulties which it meets in the achievement of the objective outlined in paragraph 13 of this article and shall indicate the specific measure affecting imports which it proposes to introduce in order to remedy these difficulties. it shall not introduce that measure before the expiration of the time-limit laid down in paragraph 15 or 17, as the case may be, or if the measure affects imports of a product which is the subject of a concession included in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement, unless it has secured the concurrence of the contracting parties in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 18; provided that, if the industry receiving assistance has already started production, the contracting party may, after informing the contracting parties, take such measures as may be necessary to prevent, during that period, imports of the product or products concerned from increasing substantially above a normal level.*15. if, within thirty days of the notification of the measure, the contracting parties do not request the contracting party concerned to consult with them,* that contracting party shall be free to deviate from the relevant provisions of the other articles of this agreement to the extent necessary to apply the proposed measure.16. if it is requested by the contracting parties to do so,* the contracting party concerned shall consult with them as to the purpose of the proposed measure, as to alternative measures which may be available under this agreement, and as to the possible effect of the measure proposed on the commercial and economic interests of other contracting parties. if, as a result of such consultation, the contracting parties agree that there is no measure consistent with the other provisions of this agreement which is practicable in order to achieve the objective outlined in paragraph 13 of this article, and concur* in the proposed measure, the contracting party concerned shall be released from its obligations under the relevant provisions of the other articles of this agreement to the extent necessary to apply that measure.17. if, within ninety days after the date of the notification of the proposed measure under paragraph 14 of this article, the contracting parties have not concurred in such measure, the contracting party concerned may introduce the measure proposed after informing the contracting parties.18. if the proposed measure affects a product which is the subject of a concession included in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement, the contracting party concerned shall enter into consultations with any other contracting party with which the concession was initially negotiated, and with any other contracting party determined by the contracting parties to have a substantial interest therein. the contracting parties shall concur* in the measure if they agree that there is no measure consistent with the other provisions of this agreement which is practicable in order to achieve the objective set forth in paragraph 13 of this article, and if they are satisfied:(a) that agreement has been reached with such other contracting parties as a result of the consultations referred to above, or(b) if no such agreement has been reached within sixty days after the notification provided for in paragraph 14 has been received by the contracting parties, that the contracting party having recourse to this section has made all reasonable efforts to reach an agreement and that the interests of other contracting parties are adequately safeguarded.*the contracting party having recourse to this section shall thereupon be released from its obligations under the relevant provisions of the other articles of this agreement to the extent necessary to permit it to apply the measure.19. if a proposed measure of the type described in paragraph 13 of this article concerns an industry the establishment of which has in the initial period been facilitated by incidental protection afforded by restrictions imposed by the contracting party concerned for balance of payments purposes under the relevant provisions of this agreement, that contracting party may resort to the provisions and procedures of this section; provided that it shall not apply the proposed measure without the concurrence* of the contracting parties.*20. nothing in the preceding paragraphs of this section shall authorize any deviation from the provisions of articles i, ii and xiii of this agreement. the provisos to paragraph 10 of this article shall also be applicable to any restriction under this section.21. at any time while a measure is being applied under paragraph 17 of this article any contracting party substantially affected by it may suspend the application to the trade of the contracting party having recourse to this section of such substantially equivalent concessions or other obligations under this agreement the suspension of which the contracting parties do not disapprove;* provided that sixty days' notice of such suspension is given to the contracting parties not later than six months after the measure has been introduced or changed substantially to the detriment of the contracting party affected. any such contracting party shall afford adequate opportunity for consultation in accordance with the provisions of article xxii of this agreement.section d22. a contracting party coming within the scope of sub-paragraph 4(b) of this article desiring, in the interest of the development of its economy, to introduce a measure of the type described in paragraph 13 of this article in respect of the establishment of a particular industry* may apply to the contracting parties for approval of such measure. the contracting parties shall promptly consult with such contracting party and shall, in making their decision, be guided by the considerations set out in paragraph 16. if the contracting parties concur* in the proposed measure the contracting party concerned shall be released from its obligations under the relevant provisions of the other articles of this agreement to the extent necessary to permit it to apply the measure. if the proposed measure affects a product which is the subject of a concession included in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement, the provisions of paragraph 18 shall apply.*23. any measure applied under this section shall comply with the provisions of paragraph 20 of this article ARTICLE xixemergency action on imports of particular products1. (a) if, as a result of unforeseen developments and of the effect of the obligations incurred by a contracting party under this agreement, including tariff concessions, any product is being imported into the territory of that contracting party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers in that territory of like or directly competitive products, the contracting party shall be free, in respect of such product, and to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such injury, to suspend the obligation in whole or in part or to withdraw or modify the concession.(b) if any product, which is the subject of a concession with respect to a preference, is being imported into the territory of a contracting party in the circumstances set forth in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, so as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of a contracting party which receives or received such preference, the importing contracting party shall be free, if that other contracting party so requests, to suspend the relevant obligation in whole or in part or to withdraw or modify the concession in respect of the product, to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such injury.2. before any contracting party shall take action pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, it shall give notice in writing to the contracting parties as far in advance as may be practicable and shall afford the contracting parties and those contracting parties having a substantial interest as exporters of the product concerned an opportunity to consult with it in respect of the proposed action. when such notice is given in relation to a concession with respect to a preference, the notice shall name the contracting party which has requested the action. in critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, action under paragraph 1 of this article may be taken provisionally without prior consultation, on the condition that consultation shall be effected immediately after taking such action.3. (a) if agreement among the interested contracting parties with respect to the action is not reached, the contracting party which proposes to take or continue the action shall, nevertheless, be free to do so, and if such action is taken or continued, the affected contracting parties shall then be free, not later than ninety days after such action is taken, to suspend, upon the expiration of thirty days from the day on which written notice of such suspension is received by the contracting parties, the application to the trade of the contracting party taking such action, or, in the case envisaged in paragraph 1(b) of this article, to the trade of the contracting party requesting such action, of such substantially equivalent concessions or other obligations under this agreement the suspension of which the contracting parties do not disapprove.(b) notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, where action is taken under paragraph 2 of this article without prior consultation and causes or threatens serious injury in the territory of a contracting party to the domestic producers of products affected by the action, that contracting party shall, where delay would cause damage difficult to repair, be free to suspend, upon the taking of the action and throughout the period of consultation, such concessions or other obligations as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the injury ARTICLE xxgeneral exceptionssubject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures:(a) necessary to protect public morals;(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;(c) relating to the importation or exportation of gold or silver;(d) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement, including those relating to customs enforcement, the enforcement of monopolies operated under paragraph 4 of article ii and article xvii, the protection of patents, trade marks and copyrights, and the prevention of deceptive practices;(e) relating to the products of prison labour;(f) imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value;(g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption;(h) undertaken in pursuance of obligations under any intergovernmental commodity agreement which conforms to criteria submitted to the contracting parties and not disapproved by them or which is itself so submitted and not so disapproved;*(i) involving restrictions on exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as part of a governmental stabilization plan; provided that such restrictions shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of this agreement relating to non-discrimination;(j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general or local short supply; provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that all contracting parties are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such measures, which are inconsistent with the other provisions of this agreement shall be discontinued as soon as the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist. the contracting parties shall review the need for this sub-paragraph not later than 30 june 1960 ARTICLE xxisecurity exceptionsnothing in this agreement shall be construed(a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or(b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests(i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;(ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment;(iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; or(c) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the united nations charter for the maintenance of international peace and security ARTICLE xxiiconsultation1. each contracting party shall accord sympathetic consideration to, and shall afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding, such representations as may be made by another contracting party with respect to any matter affecting the operation of this agreement.2. the contracting parties may, at the request of a contracting party, consult with any contracting party or parties in respect of any matter for which it has not been possible to find a satisfactory solution through consultation under paragraph 1 ARTICLE xxiiinullification or impairment1. if any contracting party should consider that any benefit accruing to it directly or indirectly under this agreement is being nullified or impaired or that the attainment of any objective of the agreement is being impeded as the result of(a) the failure of another contracting party to carry out its obligations under this agreement, or(b) the application by another contracting party of any measure, whether or not it conflicts with the provisions of this agreement, or(c) the existence of any other situation,the contracting party may, with a view to the satisfactory adjustment of the matter, make written representations or proposals to the other contracting party which it considers to be concerned. any contracting party thus approached shall give sympathetic consideration to the representations or proposals made to it.2. if no satisfactory adjustment is effected between the contracting parties concerned within a reasonable time, or if the difficulty is of the type described in paragraph 1(c) of this article, the matter may be referred to the contracting parties. the contracting parties shall promptly investigate any matter so referred to them and shall make appropriate recommendations to the contracting parties which they consider to be concerned, or give a ruling on the matter, as appropriate. the contracting parties may consult with contracting parties, with the economic and social council of the united nations and with any appropriate inter-governmental organization in cases where they consider such consultation necessary. if the contracting parties consider that the circumstances are serious enough to justify such action, they may authorize a contracting party or parties to suspend the application to any other contracting party or parties of such concessions or other obligations under this agreement as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances. if the application to any contracting party of any concession or other obligation is in fact suspended, that contracting party shall then be free, not later than sixty days after such action is taken, to give written notice to the executive secretary to the contracting parties of its intention to withdraw from this agreement and such withdrawal shall take effect upon the sixtieth day following the day on which such notice is received by him.part iii ARTICLE xxivterritorial application - frontier traffic - customs unions and free-trade areas1. the provisions of this agreement shall apply to the metropolitan customs territories of the contracting parties and to any other customs territories in respect of which this agreement has been accepted under article xxvi or is being applied under article xxxiii or pursuant to the protocol of provisional application. each such customs territory shall, exclusively for the purposes of the territorial application of this agreement, be treated as though it were a contracting party; provided that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to create any rights or obligations as between two or more customs territories in respect of which this agreement has been accepted under article xxvi or is being applied under article xxxiii or pursuant to the protocol of provisional application by a single contracting party.2. for the purposes of this agreement a customs territory shall be understood to mean any territory with respect to which separate tariffs or other regulations of commerce are maintained for a substantial part of the trade of such territory with other territories.3. the provisions of this agreement shall not be construed to prevent:(a) advantages accorded by any contracting party to adjacent countries in order to facilitate frontier traffic;(b) advantages accorded to the trade with the free territory of trieste by countries contiguous to that territory, provided that such advantages are not in conflict with the treaties of peace arising out of the second world war.4. the contracting parties recognize the desirability of increasing freedom of trade by the development, through voluntary agreements, of closer integration between the economies of the countries parties to such agreements. they also recognize that the purpose of a customs union or of a free-trade area should be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other contracting parties with such territories.5. accordingly, the provisions of this agreement shall not prevent, as between the territories of contracting parties, the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area or the adoption of an interim agreement necessary for the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area; provided that:(a) with respect to a customs union, or an interim agreement leading to the formation of a customs union, the duties and other regulations of commerce imposed at the institution of any such union or interim agreement in respect of trade with contracting parties not parties to such union or agreement shall not on the whole be higher or more restrictive than the general incidence of the duties and regulations of commerce applicable in the constituent territories prior to the formation of such union or the adoption of such interim agreement, as the case may be;(b) with respect to a free-trade area, or an interim agreement leading to the formation of a free-trade area, the duties and other regulations of commerce maintained in each of the constituent territories and applicable at the formation of such free-trade area or the adoption of such interim agreement to the trade of contracting parties not included in such area or not parties to such agreement shall not be higher or more restrictive than the corresponding duties and other regulations of commerce existing in the same constituent territories prior to the formation of the free-trade area, or interim agreement, as the case may be; and(c) any interim agreement referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) shall include a plan and schedule for the formation of such a customs union or of such a free-trade area within a reasonable length of time.6. if, in fulfilling the requirements of sub-paragraph 5(a), a contracting party proposes to increase any rate of duty inconsistently with the provisions of article ii, the procedure set forth in article xxviii shall apply. in providing for compensatory adjustment, due account shall be taken of the compensation already afforded by the reductions brought about in the corresponding duty of the other constituents of the union.7. (a) any contracting party deciding to enter into a customs union or free-trade area, or an interim agreement leading to the formation of such a union or area, shall promptly notify the contracting parties and shall make available to them such information regarding the proposed union or area as will enable them to make such reports and recommendations to contracting parties as they may deem appropriate.(b) if, after having studied the plan and schedule included in an interim agreement referred to in paragraph 5 in consultation with the parties to that agreement and taking due account of the information made available in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (a), the contracting parties find that such agreement is not likely to result in the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area within the period contemplated by the parties to the agreement or that such period is not a reasonable one, the contracting parties shall make recommendations to the parties to the agreement. the parties shall not maintain or put into force, as the case may be, such agreement if they are not prepared to modify it in accordance with these recommendations.(c) any substantial change in the plan or schedule referred to in paragraph 5(c) shall be communicated to the contracting parties, which may request the contracting parties concerned to consult with them if the change seems likely to jeopardize or delay unduly the formation of the customs union or of the free-trade area.8. for the purposes of this agreement:(a) a customs union shall be understood to mean the substitution of a single customs territory for two or more customs territories, so that(i) duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted under articles xi, xii, xiii, xiv, xv and xx) are eliminated with respect to substantially all the trade between the constituent territories of the union or at least with respect to substantially all the trade in products originating in such territories, and,(ii) subject to the provisions of paragraph 9, substantially the same duties and other regulations of commerce are applied by each of the members of the union to the trade of territories not included in the union;(b) a free-trade area shall be understood to mean a group of two or more customs territories in which the duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted under articles xi, xii, xiii, xiv, xv and xx) are eliminated on substantially all the trade between the constituent territories in products originating in such territories.9. the preferences referred to in paragraph 2 of article i shall not be affected by the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area but may be eliminated or adjusted by means of negotiations with contracting parties affected.* this procedure of negotiations with affected contracting parties shall, in particular, apply to the elimination of preferences required to conform with the provisions of paragraph 8(a)(i) and paragraph 8(b).10. the contracting parties may by a two-thirds majority approve proposals which do not fully comply with the requirements of paragraphs 5 to 9 inclusive, provided that such proposals lead to the formation of a customs union or a free-trade area in the sense of this article.11. taking into account the exceptional circumstances arising out of the establishment of india and pakistan as independent states and recognizing the fact that they have long constituted an economic unit, the contracting parties agree that the provisions of this agreement shall not prevent the two countries from entering into special arrangements with respect to the trade between them, pending the establishment of their mutual trade relations on a definitive basis.*12. each contracting party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure observance of the provisions of this agreement by the regional and local governments and authorities within its territory ARTICLE xxvjoint action by the contracting parties1. representatives of the contracting parties shall meet from time to time for the purpose of giving effect to those provisions of this agreement which involve joint action and, generally, with a view to facilitating the operation and furthering the objectives of this agreement.

convene the first meeting of the contracting parties, which shall take place not later than 1 march 1948.3. each contracting party shall be entitled to have one vote at all meetings of the contracting parties.4. except as otherwise provided for in this agreement, decisions of the contracting parties shall be taken by a majority of the votes cast.5. in exceptional circumstances not elsewhere provided for in this agreement, the contracting parties may waive an obligation imposed upon a contracting party by this agreement; provided that any such decision shall be approved by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast and that such majority shall comprise more than half of the contracting parties. the contracting parties may also by such a vote:(i) define certain categories of exceptional circumstances to which other voting requirements shall apply for the waiver of obligations, and(ii) prescribe such criteria as may be necessary for the application of this paragraph ARTICLE xxviacceptance, entry into force and registration1. the date of this agreement shall be 30 october 1947.2. this agreement shall be open for acceptance by any contracting party which, on 1 march 1955,

instrument of acceptance with the executive secretary to the contracting parties, who will inform all interested governments of the date of deposit of each instrument of acceptance and of the day on which this agreement enters into force under paragraph 6 of this article.5. (a) each government accepting this agreement does so in respect of its metropolitan territory and of the other territories for which it has international responsibility, except such separate customs territories as it shall notify to the executive secretary to the contracting parties at the time of its own acceptance.(b) any government, which has so notified the executive secretary under the exceptions in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, may at any time give notice to the executive secretary that its acceptance shall be effective in respect of any separate customs territory or territories so excepted and such notice shall take effect on the thirtieth day following the day on which it is received by the executive secretary.(c) if any of the customs territories, in respect of which a contracting party has accepted this agreement, possesses or acquires full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations and of the other matters provided for in this agreement, such territory shall, upon sponsorship through a declaration by the responsible contracting party establishing the above-mentioned fact, be deemed to be a contracting party.6. this agreement shall enter into force, as among the governments which have accepted it, on the thirtieth day following the day on which instruments of acceptance have been deposited with the executive secretary to the contracting parties on behalf of governments named in annex h, the territories of which account for 85 per centum of the total external trade of the territories of such governments, computed in accordance with the applicable column of percentages set forth therein. the instrument of acceptance of each other government shall take effect on the thirtieth day following the day on which such instrument has been deposited.7. the united nations is authorized to effect registration of this agreement as soon as it enters into force ARTICLE xxviiwithholding or withdrawal of concessionsany contracting party shall at any time be free to withhold or to withdraw in whole or in part any concession, provided for in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement, in respect of which such contracting party determines that it was initially negotiated with a government which has not become, or has ceased to be, a contracting party. a contracting party taking such action shall notify the contracting parties and, upon request, consult with contracting parties which have a substantial interest in the product concerned ARTICLE xxviii*modification of schedules1. on the first day of each three-year period, the first period beginning on 1 january 1958 (or on the first day of any other period* that may be specified by the contracting parties by two-thirds of the votes cast) a contracting party (hereafter in this article referred to as the "applicant contracting party") may, by negotiation and agreement with any contracting party with which such concession was initially negotiated and with any other contracting party determined by the contracting parties to have a principal supplying interest* (which two preceding categories of contracting parties, together with the applicant contracting party, are in this article hereinafter referred to as the "contracting parties primarily concerned"), and subject to consultation with any other contracting party determined by the contracting parties to have a substantial interest* in such concession, modify or withdraw a concession* included in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement.2. in such negotiations and agreement, which may include provision for compensatory adjustment with respect to other products, the contracting parties concerned shall endeavour to maintain a general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions not less favourable to trade than that provided for in this agreement prior to such negotiations.3. (a) if agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned cannot be reached before 1 january 1958 or before the expiration of a period envisaged in paragraph 1 of this article, the contracting party which proposes to modify or withdraw the concession shall, nevertheless, be free to do so and if such action is taken any contracting party with which such concession was initially negotiated, any contracting party determined under paragraph 1 to have a principal supplying interest and any contracting party determined under paragraph 1 to have a substantial interest shall then be free not later than six months after such action is taken, to withdraw, upon the expiration of thirty days from the date on which written notice of such withdrawal is received by the contracting parties, substantially equivalent concessions initially negotiated with the applicant contracting party.(b) if agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned is reached but any other contracting party determined under paragraph 1 of this article to have a substantial interest is not satisfied, such other contracting party shall be free, not later than six months after action under such agreement is taken, to withdraw, upon the expiration of thirty days from the day on which written notice of such withdrawal is received by the contracting parties, substantially equivalent concessions initially negotiated with the applicant contracting party.4. the contracting parties may, at any time, in special circumstances, authorize* a contracting party to enter into negotiations for modification or withdrawal of a concession included in the appropriate schedule annexed to this agreement subject to the following procedures and conditions:(a) such negotiations* and any related consultations shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this article.(b) if agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned is reached in the negotiations, the provisions of paragraph 3(b) of this article shall apply.(c) if agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned is not reached within a period of sixty days* after negotiations have been authorized, or within such longer period as the contracting parties may have prescribed, the applicant contracting party may refer the matter to the contracting parties.(d) upon such reference, the contracting parties shall promptly examine the matter and submit their views to the contracting parties primarily concerned with the aim of achieving a settlement. if a settlement is reached, the provisions of paragraph 3(b) shall apply as if agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned had been reached. if no settlement is reached between the contracting parties primarily concerned, the applicant contracting party shall be free to modify or withdraw the concession, unless the contracting parties determine that the applicant contracting party has unreasonably failed to offer adequate compensation.* if such action is taken, any contracting party with which the concession was initially negotiated, any contracting party determined under paragraph 4(a) to have a principal supplying interest and any contracting party determined under paragraph 4(a) to have a substantial interest, shall be free, not later than six months after such action is taken, to modify or withdraw, upon the expiration of thirty days from the day on which written notice of such withdrawal is received by the contracting parties, substantially equivalent concessions initially negotiated with the applicant contracting party.5. before 1 january 1958 and before the end of any period envisaged in paragraph 1 a contracting party may elect by notifying the contracting parties to reserve the right, for the duration of the next period, to modify the appropriate schedule in accordance with the procedures of paragraphs 1 to 3. if a contracting party so elects, other contracting parties shall have the right, during the same period, to modify or withdraw, in accordance with the same procedures, concessions initially negotiated with that contracting party ARTICLE xxviii bistariff negotiations1. the contracting parties recognize that customs duties often constitute serious obstacles to trade; thus negotiations on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis, directed to the substantial reduction of the general level of tariffs and other charges on imports and exports and in particular to the reduction of such high tariffs as discourage the importation even of minimum quantities, and conducted with due regard to the objectives of this agreement and the varying needs of individual contracting parties, are of great importance to the expansion of international trade. the contracting parties may therefore sponsor such negotiations from time to time.2. (a) negotiations under this article may be carried out on a selective product-by-product basis or by the application of such multilateral procedures as may be accepted by the contracting parties concerned. such negotiations may be directed towards the reduction of duties, the binding of duties at then existing levels or undertakings that individual duties or the average duties on specified categories of products shall not exceed specified levels. the binding against increase of low duties or of duty-free treatment shall, in principle, be recognized as a concession equivalent in value to the reduction of high duties.(b) the contracting parties recognize that in general the success of multilateral negotiations would depend on the participation of all contracting parties which conduct a substantial proportion of their external trade with one another.3. negotiations shall be conducted on a basis which affords adequate opportunity to take into account:(a) the needs of individual contracting parties and individual industries;(b) the needs of less-developed countries for a more flexible use of tariff protection to assist their economic development and the special needs of these countries to maintain tariffs for revenue purposes; and(c) all other relevant circumstances, including the fiscal,* developmental, strategic and other needs of the contracting parties concerned ARTICLE xxixthe relation of this agreement to the havana charter1. the contracting parties undertake to observe the fullest extent of their executive authority the general principles of chapters i to vi inclusive and of chapter ix of the havana charter pending their acceptance of it in accordance with their constitutional procedures.*2. part ii of this agreement shall be suspended on the day on

agreement shall be amended, supplemented or maintained.4. if at any time the havana charter should cease to be in force, the contracting parties shall meet as soon as practicable thereafter to agree whether this agreement shall be supplemented, amended or maintained. pending such agreement, part ii of this agreement shall again enter into force; provided that the provisions of part ii other than article xxiii shall be replaced, mutatis mutandis, in the form in which they then appeared in the havana charter; and provided further that no contracting party shall be bound by any provisions which did not bind it at the time when the havana charter ceased to be in force.5. if any contracting party has not accepted the havana charter by the date upon which it enters into force, the contracting parties shall confer to agree whether, and if so in what way, this agreement in so far as it affects relations between such contracting party and other contracting parties, shall be supplemented or amended. pending such agreement the provisions of part ii of this agreement shall, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this article, continue to apply as between such contracting party and other contracting parties.6. contracting parties which are members of the international trade organization shall not invoke the provisions of this agreement so as to prevent the operation of any provision of the havana charter. the application of the principle underlying this paragraph to any contracting party which is not a member of the international trade organization shall be the subject

may specify. the contracting parties may decide that any amendment made effective under this article is of such a nature that any contracting party which has not accepted it within a period specified by the contracting parties shall be free to withdraw from this agreement, or to remain a contracting party with the consent of the contracting parties ARTICLE xxxiwithdrawalwithout prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 12 of article xviii, of article xxiii or of paragraph 2 of article xxx, any contracting party may withdraw from this agreement, or may separately withdraw on behalf of any of the separate customs territories for which it has international responsibility and which at the time possesses full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations and of the other matters provided for in this agreement. the withdrawal shall take effect upon the expiration of six months from the day on which written notice of withdrawal is received by the secretary-general of the united nations ARTICLE xxxiicontracting parties1. the contracting parties to this agreement shall be understood to mean those governments which are applying the provisions of this agreement under

time either becomes a contracting party, does not consent to such application.2. the contracting parties may review the operation of this article in particular cases at the request of any contracting party and make appropriate recommendations.part ivtrade and development ARTICLE xxxviprinciples and objectives1.* the contracting parties:(a) recalling that the basic objectives of this agreement include the raising of standards of living and the progressive development of the economies of all contracting parties, and considering that the attainment of these objectives is particularly urgent for less-developed contracting parties;(b) considering that export earnings of the less-developed contracting parties can play a vital part in their economic development and that the extent of this contribution depends on the prices paid by the less-developed contracting parties for essential imports, the volume of their exports, and the prices received for these exports;(c) noting, that there is a wide gap between standards of living in less-developed countries and in other countries;(d) recognizing that individual and joint action is essential to further the development of the economies of less-developed contracting parties and to bring about a rapid advance in the standards of living in these countries;(e) recognizing that international trade as a means of achieving economic and social advancement should be governed by such rules and procedures - and measures in conformity with such rules and procedures - as are consistent with the objectives set forth in this article;(f) noting that the contracting parties may enable less-developed contracting parties to use special measures to promote their trade and development;agree as follows.2. there is need for a rapid and sustained expansion of the export earnings of the less-developed contracting parties.3. there is need for positive efforts designed to ensure that less-developed contracting parties secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development.4. given the continued dependence of many less-developed contracting parties on the exportation of a limited range of primary products,* there is need to provide in the largest possible measure more favourable and acceptable conditions of access to world markets for these products, and wherever appropriate to devise measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these products, including in particular measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices, thus permitting an expansion of world trade and demand and a dynamic and steady growth of the real export earnings of these countries so as to provide them with expanding resources for their economic development.5. the rapid expansion of the economies of the less-developed contracting parties will be facilitated by a diversification* of the structure of their economies and the avoidance of an excessive dependence on the export of primary products. there is, therefore, need for increased access in the largest possible measure to markets under favourable conditions for processed and manufactured products currently or potentially of particular export interest to less-developed contracting parties.6. because of the chronic deficiency in the export proceeds and other foreign exchange earnings of less-developed contracting parties, there are important inter-relationships between trade and financial assistance to development. there is, therefore, need for close and continuing collaboration between the contracting parties and the international lending agencies so that they can contribute most effectively to alleviating the burdens these less-developed contracting parties assume in the interest of their economic development.7. there is need for appropriate collaboration between the contracting parties, other intergovernmental bodies and the organs and agencies of the united nations system, whose activities relate to the trade and economic development of less-developed countries.8. the developed contracting parties do not expect reciprocity for commitments made by them in trade negotiations to reduce or remove tariffs and other barriers to the trade of less-developed contracting parties.*9. the adoption of measures to give effect to these principles and objectives shall be a matter of conscious and purposeful effort on the part of the contracting parties both individually and jointly ARTICLE xxxviicommitments1. the developed contracting parties shall to the fullest extent possible - that is, except when compelling reasons, which may include legal reasons, make it impossible - give effect to the following provisions:(a) accord high priority to the reduction and elimination of barriers to products currently or potentially of particular export interest to less-developed contracting parties, including customs duties and other restrictions which differentiate unreasonably between such products in their primary and in their processed forms;*(b) refrain from introducing, or increasing the incidence of, customs duties or non-tariff import barriers on products currently or potentially of particular export interest to less-developed contracting parties; and(c) (i) refrain from imposing new fiscal measures; and(ii) in any adjustments of fiscal policy accord priority to the reduction and elimination of fiscal measures,which would hamper, or which hamper, significantly the growth of consumption of primary products, in raw or processed form, wholly or mainly produced in the territories of less-developed contracting parties, and which are applied specifically to those products.2. (a) whenever it is considered that effect is not being given to any of the provisions of sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1, the matter shall be reported to the contracting parties either by the contracting party not so giving effect to the relevant provisions or by any other interested contracting party.(b) (i) the contracting parties shall, if requested so to do by any interested contracting party, and without prejudice to any bilateral consultations that may be undertaken, consult with the contracting party concerned and all interested contracting parties with respect to the matter with a view to reaching solutions satisfactory to all contracting parties concerned in order to further the objectives set forth in article xxxvi. in the course of these consultations, the reasons given in cases where effect was not being given to the provisions of sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c) or paragraph 1 shall be examined.(ii) as the implementation of the provisions of sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 by individual contracting parties may in some cases be more readily achieved where action is taken jointly with other developed contracting parties, such consultation might, where appropriate, be directed towards this end.(iii) the consultations by the contracting parties might also, in appropriate cases, be directed towards agreement on joint action designed to further the objectives of this agreement as envisaged in paragraph 1 of article xxv.3. the developed contracting parties shall:(a) make every effort, in cases where a government directly or indirectly determines the resale price of products wholly or mainly produced in the territories of less-developed contracting parties, to maintain trade margins at equitable levels;(b) give active consideration to the adoption of other measures* designed to provide greater scope for the development of imports from less-developed contracting parties and collaborate in appropriate international action to this end;(c) have special regard to the trade interests of less-developed contracting parties when considering the application of other measures permitted under this agreement to meet particular problems and explore all possibilities of constructive remedies before applying such measures where they would affect essential interests of those contracting parties.4. less-developed contracting parties agree to take appropriate action in implementation of the provisions of part iv for the benefit of the trade of other less-developed contracting parties, in so far as such action is consistent with their individual present and future development, financial and trade needs taking into account past trade developments as well as the trade interests of less-developed contracting parties as a whole.5. in the implementation of the commitments set forth in paragraphs 1 to 4 each contracting party shall afford to any other interested contracting party or contracting parties full and prompt opportunity for consultations under the normal procedures of this agreement with respect to any matter or difficulty which may arise ARTICLE xxxviiijoint action1. the contracting parties shall collaborate jointly, within the framework of this agreement and elsewhere, as appropriate, to further the objectives set forth in article xxxvi.2. in particular, the contracting parties shall:(a) where appropriate, take action, including action through international arrangements, to provide improved and acceptable conditions of access to world markets for primary products of particular interest to less-developed contracting parties and to devise measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these products including measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices for exports of such products;(b) seek appropriate collaboration in matters of trade and development policy with the united nations and its organs and agencies, including any institutions that may be created on the basis of recommendations by the united nations conference on trade and development;(c) collaborate in analysing the development plans and policies of individual less-developed contracting parties and in examining trade and aid relationships with a view to devising concrete measures to promote the development of export potential and to facilitate access to export markets for the products of the industries thus developed and, in this connexion, seek appropriate collaboration with governments and international organizations, and in particular with organizations having competence in relation to financial assistance for economic development, in systematic studies of trade and aid relationships in individual less-developed contracting parties aimed at obtaining a clear analysis of export potential, market prospects and any further action that may be required;(d) keep under continuous review the development of world trade with special reference to the rate of growth of the trade of less-developed contracting parties and make such recommendations to contracting parties as may, in the circumstances, be deemed appropriate;(e) collaborate in seeking feasible methods to expand trade for the purpose of economic development, through international harmonization and adjustment of national policies and regulations, through technical and commercial standards affecting production, transportation and marketing, and through export promotion by the establishment of facilities for the increased flow of trade information and the development of market research; and(f) establish such institutional arrangements as may be necessary to further the objectives set forth in article xxxvi and to give effect to the provisions of this part ANNEX alist of territories referred to in paragraph 2(a) of article iunited kingdom of great britain and northern irelanddependent territories of the united kingdom of

article iparagraph 1the obligations incorporated in paragraph 1 of article i by reference to paragraphs 2 and 4 of article iii and those incorporated in paragraph 2(b) of article ii by reference to article vi shall be considered as falling within part ii for the purposes of the protocol of provisional application.the cross-references, in the paragraph immediately above and in paragraph 1 of article i, to paragraphs 2 and 4 of article iii shall only apply after article iii has been modified by the entry into force of the amendment provided for in the protocol modifying part ii and article xxvi of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, dated 14 september 1948.[4]paragraph 4the term "margin of preference" means the absolute difference between the most-favoured-nation rate of duty and the preferential rate of duty for the like product, and not the proportionate relation between those rates. as examples:(1) if the most-favoured nation rate were 36 per cent ad valorem and the preferential rate were 24 per cent ad valorem, the margin of preference would be 12 per cent ad valorem, and not one-third of the most-favoured-nation rate;(2) if the most-favoured-nation rate were 36 per cent ad valorem and the preferential rate were expressed as two-thirds of the most-favoured-nation rate, the margin of preference would be 12 per cent ad valorem;(3) if the most-favoured-nation rate were 2 francs per kilogramme and the preferential rate were 1.50 francs per kilogramme, the margin of preference would be 0.50 franc per kilogramme.the following kinds of customs action, taken in accordance with established uniform procedures, would not be contrary to a general binding of margins of preference:(i) the re-application to an imported product of a tariff classification or rate of duty, properly applicable to such product, in cases in which the application of such classification or rate to such product was temporarily suspended or inoperative on 10 april 1947; and(ii) the classification of a particular product under a tariff item other than that under which importations of that product were classified on 10 april 1947, in cases in which the tariff law clearly contemplates that such product may be classified under more than one tariff item.ad article iiparagraph 2(a)the cross-reference, in paragraph 2(a) of article ii, to paragraph 2 of article iii shall only apply after article iii has been modified by the entry into force of the amendment provided for in the protocol modifying part ii and article xxvi of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, dated 14 september 1948.paragraph 2(b)see the note relating to paragraph 1 of article i.paragraph 4except where otherwise specifically agreed between the contracting parties which initially negotiated the concession, the provisions of this paragraph will be applied in the light of the provisions of article 31 of the havana charter.ad article iiiany internal tax or other internal charge, or any law, regulation or requirement of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 which applies to an imported product and to the like domestic product and is collected or enforced in the case of the imported product at the time or point of importation, is nevertheless to be regarded as an internal tax or other internal charge, or a law, regulation or requirement of the kind referred to in paragraph 1, and is accordingly subject to the provisions of article iii.paragraph 1the application of paragraph 1 to internal taxes imposed by local governments and authorities within the territory of a contracting party is subject to the provisions of the final paragraph of article xxiv. the term "reasonable measures" in the last-mentioned paragraph would not require, for example, the repeal of existing national legislation authorizing local governments to impose internal taxes which, although technically inconsistent with the letter of article iii, are not in fact inconsistent with its spirit, if such repeal would result in a serious financial hardship for the local governments or authorities concerned. with regard to taxation by local governments or authorities which is inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of article iii, the term "reasonable measures" would permit a contracting party to eliminate the inconsistent taxation gradually over a transition period, if abrupt action would create serious administrative and financial difficulties.paragraph 2a tax conforming to the requirements of the first sentence of paragraph 2 would be considered to be inconsistent with the provisions of the second sentence only in cases where competition was involved between, on the one hand, the taxed product and, on the other hand, a directly competitive or substitutable product which was not similarly taxed.paragraph 5regulations consistent with the provisions of the first sentence of paragraph 5 shall not be considered to be contrary to the provisions of the second sentence in any case in which all of the products subject to the regulations are produced domestically in substantial quantities. a regulation cannot be justified as being consistent with the provisions of the second sentence on the ground that the proportion or amount allocated to each of the products which are the subject of the regulation constitutes an equitable relationship between imported and domestic products.ad article vparagraph 5with regard to transportation charges, the principle laid down in paragraph 5 refers to like products being transported on the same route under like conditions.ad article viparagraph 11. hidden dumping by associated houses (that is, the sale by an importer at a price below that corresponding to the price invoiced by an exporter with whom the importer is associated, and also below the price in the exporting country) constitutes a form of price dumping with respect to which the margin of dumping may be calculated on the basis of the price at which the goods are resold by the importer.2. it is recognized that, in the case of imports from a country which has a complete or substantially complete monopoly of its trade and where all domestic prices are fixed by the state, special difficulties may exist in determining price comparability for the purposes of paragraph 1, and in such cases importing contracting parties may find it necessary to take into account the possibility that a strict comparison with domestic prices in such a country may not always be appropriate.paragraphs 2 and 31. as in many other cases in customs administration, a contracting party may require reasonable security (bond or cash deposit) for the payment of anti-dumping or countervailing duty pending final determination of the facts in any case of suspected dumping or subsidization.2. multiple currency practices can in certain circumstances constitute a subsidy to exports which may be met by countervailing duties under paragraph 3 or can constitute a form of dumping by means of a partial depreciation of a country's currency which may be met by action under paragraph 2. by "multiple currency practices" is meant practices by governments or sanctioned by governments.paragraph 6(b)waivers under the provisions of this sub-paragraph shall be granted only on application by the contracting party proposing to levy an anti-dumping or countervailing duty, as the case may be.ad article viiparagraph 1the expression "or other charges" is not to be regarded as including internal taxes or equivalent charges imposed on or in connexion with imported products.paragraph 21. it would be in conformity with article vii to presume that "actual value" may be represented by the invoice price, plus any non-included charges for legitimate costs which are proper elements of "actual value" and plus any abnormal discount or other reduction from the ordinary competitive price.2. it would be in conformity with article vii, paragraph 2(b), for a contracting party to construe the phrase " in the ordinary course of trade . . . under fully competitive conditions", as excluding any transaction wherein the buyer and seller are not independent of each other and price is not the sole consideration.3. the standard of "fully competitive conditions" permits a contracting party to exclude from consideration prices involving special discounts limited to exclusive agents.4. the wording of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) permits a contracting party to determine the value for customs proposes uniformly either (1) on the basis of a particular exporter's prices of the imported merchandise, or (2) on the basis of the general price level of like merchandise.ad article viii1. while article viii does not cover the use of multiple rates of exchange as such, paragraphs 1 and 4 condemn the use of exchange taxes or fees as a device for implementing multiple currency practices; if, however, a contracting party is using multiple currency exchange fees for balance of payments reasons with the approval of the international monetary fund, the provisions of paragraph 9(a) of article xv fully safeguard its position.2. it would be consistent with paragraph 1 if, on the importation of products from the territory of a contracting party into the territory of another contracting party, the production of certificates of origin should only be required to the extent that is strictly indispensable.ad articles xi, xii, xiii, xiv and xviiithroughout articles xi, xii, xiii, xiv and xviii, the terms "import restrictions" or "export restrictions" include restrictions made effective through state-trading operations.ad article xiparagraph 2(c)the term "in any form" in this paragraph covers the same products when in an early stage of processing and still perishable, which compete directly with the fresh product and if freely imported would tend to make the restriction on the fresh product ineffective.paragraph 2, last sub-paragraphthe term "special factors" includes changes in relative productive efficiency as between domestic and foreign producers, or as between different foreign producers, but not changes artificially brought about by means not permitted under the agreement.ad article xiithe contracting parties shall make provision for the utmost secrecy in the conduct of any consultation under the provisions of this article.paragraph 3(c)(i)contracting parties applying restrictions shall endeavour to avoid causing serious prejudice to exports of a commodity on which the economy of a contracting party is largely dependent.paragraph 4(b)it is agreed that the date shall be within ninety days after the entry into force of the amendments of this article effected by the protocol amending the preamble and parts ii and iii of this agreement. however, should the contracting parties find that conditions were not suitable for the application of the provisions of this sub-paragraph at the time envisaged, they may determine a later date; provided that such date is not more than thirty days after such time as the obligations of article viii, sections 2, 3 and 4, of the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund become applicable to contracting parties, members of the fund, the combined foreign trade of which constitutes at least fifty per centum of the aggregate foreign trade of all contracting parties.paragraph 4(e)it is agreed that paragraph 4(e) does not add any new criteria for the imposition or maintenance of quantitative restrictions for balance of payments reasons. it is solely intended to ensure that all external factors such as changes in the terms of trade, quantitative restrictions, excessive tariffs and subsidies, which may be contributing to the balance of payments difficulties of the contracting party applying restrictions, will be fully taken into account.ad article xiiiparagraph 2(d)no mention was made of "commercial considerations" as a rule for the allocation of quotas because it was considered that its application by governmental authorities might not always be practicable. moreover, in cases where it is practicable, a contracting party could apply these considerations in the process of seeking agreement, consistently with the general rule laid down in the opening sentence of paragraph 2.paragraph 4see note relating to "special factors" in connexion with the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 2 of article xi.ad article xivparagraph 1the provisions of this paragraph shall not be so construed as to preclude full consideration by the contracting parties, in the consultations provided for in paragraph 4 of article xii and in paragraph 12 of article xviii, of the nature, effects and reasons for discrimination in the field of import restrictions.paragraph 2one of the situations contemplated in paragraph 2 is that of a contracting party holding balances acquired as a result of current transactions which it finds itself unable to use without a measure of discrimination.ad article xvparagraph 4the word "frustrate" is intended to indicate, for example, that infringements of the letter of any article of this agreement by exchange action shall not be regarded as a violation of that article if, in practice, there is no appreciable departure from the intent of the article. thus, a contracting party which, as part of its exchange control operated in accordance with the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund, requires payment to be received for its exports in its own currency or in the currency of one or more members of the international monetary fund will not thereby be deemed to contravene article xi or article xiii. another example would be that of a contracting party which specifies on an import licence the country from which the goods may be imported, for the purpose not of introducing any additional element of discrimination in its import licensing system but of enforcing permissible exchange controls.ad article xvithe exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for domestic consumption, or the remission of such duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have accrued, shall not be deemed to be a subsidy.section b1. nothing in section b shall preclude the use by a contracting party of multiple rates of exchange in accordance with the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund.2. for the purposes of section b, a "primary product" is understood to be any product of farm, forest or fishery, or any mineral, in its natural form or which has undergone such processing as is customarily required to prepare it for marketing in substantial volume in international trade.paragraph 31. the fact that a contracting party has not exported the product in question during the previous representative period would not in itself preclude that contracting party from establishing its right to obtain a share of the trade in the product concerned.2. a system for the stabilization of the domestic price or of the return to domestic producers of a primary product independently of the movements of export prices, which results at times in the sale of the product for export at a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic market, shall be considered not to involve a subsidy on exports within the meaning of paragraph 3 if the contracting parties determine that:(a) the system has also resulted, or is so designed as to result, in the sale of the product for export at a price higher than the comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic market; and(b) the system is so operated, or is designed so to operate, either because of the effective regulation of production or otherwise, as not to stimulate exports unduly or otherwise seriously to prejudice the interests of other contracting parties.notwithstanding such determination by the contracting parties, operations under such a system shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 where they are wholly or partly financed out of government funds in addition to the funds collected from producers in respect of the product concerned.paragraph 4the intention of paragraph 4 is that the contracting parties should seek before the end of 1957 to reach agreement to abolish all remaining subsidies as from 1 january 1958; or, failing this, to reach agreement to extend the application of the standstill until the earliest date thereafter by which they can expect to reach such agreement.ad article xviiparagraph 1the operations of marketing boards, which are established by contracting parties and are engaged in purchasing or selling, are subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b).the activities of marketing boards which are established by contracting parties and which do not purchase or sell but lay down regulations covering private trade are governed by the relevant articles of this agreement.the charging by a state enterprise of different prices for its sales of a product in different markets is not precluded by the provisions of this article, provided that such different prices are charged for commercial reasons, to meet conditions of supply and demand in export markets.paragraph 1(a)government measures imposed to ensure standards of quality and efficiency in the operation of external trade, or privileges granted for the exploitation of national natural resources but which do not empower the government to exercise control over the trading activities of the enterprise in question, do not constitute "exclusive or special privileges".paragraph 1(b)a country receiving a "tied loan" is free to take this loan into account as a "commercial consideration" when purchasing requirements abroad.paragraph 2the term "goods" is limited to products as understood in commercial practice, and is not intended to include the purchase or sale of services.paragraph 3negotiations which contracting parties agree to conduct under this paragraph may be directed towards the reduction of duties and other charges on imports and exports or towards the conclusion of any other mutually satisfactory arrangement consistent with the provisions of this agreement. (see paragraph 4 of article ii and the note to that paragraph.)paragraph 4(b)the term "import mark-up" in this paragraph shall represent the margin by which the price charged by the import monopoly for the imported product (exclusive of internal taxes within the purview of article iii, transportation, distribution, and other expenses incident to the purchase, sale or further processing, and a reasonable margin of profit) exceeds the landed cost.ad article xviiithe contracting parties and the contracting parties concerned shall preserve the utmost secrecy in respect of matters arising under this article.paragraphs 1 and 41. when they consider whether the economy of a contracting party "can only support low standards of living", the contracting parties shall take into consideration the normal position of that economy and shall not base their determination on exceptional circumstances such as those which may result from the temporary existence of exceptionally favourable conditions for the staple export product or products of such contracting party.2. the phrase "in the early stages of development" is not meant to apply only to contracting parties which have just started the economic development, but also to contracting parties the economies of which are undergoing a process of industrialization to correct an excessive dependence on primary production.paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 13 and 22the reference to the establishment of particular industries shall apply not only to the establishment of a new industry, but also to the establishment of a new branch of production in an existing industry and to the substantial transformation of an existing industry, and to the substantial expansion of an existing industry supplying a relatively small proportion of the domestic demand. it shall also cover the reconstruction of an industry destroyed or substantially damaged as a result of hostilities or natural disasters.paragraph 7(b)a modification or withdrawal, pursuant to paragraph 7(b), by a contracting party, other than the applicant contracting party, referred to in paragraph 7(a), shall be made within six months of the day on which the action is taken by the applicant contracting party, and shall become effective on the thirtieth day following the day on which such modification or withdrawal has been notified to the contracting parties.paragraph 11the second sentence in paragraph 11 shall not be interpreted to mean that a contracting party is required to relax or remove restrictions if such relaxation or removal would thereupon produce conditions justifying the intensification or institution, respectively, of restrictions under paragraph 9 of article xviii.paragraph 12(b)the date referred to in paragraph 12(b) shall be the date determined by the contracting parties in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4(b) of article xii of this agreement.paragraphs 13 and 14it is recognized that, before deciding on the introduction of a measure and notifying the contracting parties in accordance with paragraph 14, a contracting party may need a reasonable period of time to assess the competitive position of the industry concerned.paragraphs 15 and 16it is understood that the contracting parties shall invite a contracting party proposing to apply a measure under section c to consult with them pursuant to paragraph 16 if they are requested to do so by a contracting party the trade of which would be appreciably affected by the measure in question.paragraphs 16, 18, 19 and 221. it is understood that the contracting parties may concur in a proposed measure subject to specific conditions or limitations. if the measure as applied does not conform to the terms of the concurrence it will to that extent be deemed a measure in which the contracting parties have not concurred. in cases in which the contracting parties have concurred in a measure for a specified period, the contracting party concerned, if it finds that the maintenance of the measure for a further period of time is required to achieve the objective for which the measure was originally taken, may apply to the contracting parties for an extension of that period in accordance with the provisions and procedures of section c or d, as the case may be.2. it is expected that the contracting parties will, as a rule, refrain from concurring in a measure which is likely to cause serious prejudice to exports of a commodity on which the economy of a contracting party is largely dependent.paragraphs 18 and 22the phrase "that the interests of other contracting parties are adequately safeguarded" is meant to provide latitude sufficient to permit consideration in each case of the most appropriate method of safeguarding those interests. the appropriate method may, for instance, take the form of an additional concession to be applied by the contracting party having recourse to section c or d during such time as the deviation from the other articles of the agreement would remain in force or of the temporary suspension by any other contracting party referred to in paragraph 18 of a concession substantially equivalent to the impairment due to the introduction of the measure in question. such contracting party would have the right to safeguard its interests through such a temporary suspension of a concession; provided that this right will not be exercised when, in the case of a measure imposed by a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4(a), the contracting parties have determined that the extent of the compensatory concession proposed was adequate.paragraph 19the provisions of paragraph 19 are intended to cover the cases where an industry has been in existence beyond the "reasonable period of time" referred to in the note to paragraphs 13 and 14, and should not be so construed as to deprive a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4(a) of article xviii, of its right to resort to the other provisions of section c, including paragraph 17, with regard to a newly established industry even though it has benefited from incidental protection afforded by balance of payments import restrictions.paragraph 21any measure taken pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 21 shall be withdrawn forthwith if the action taken in accordance with paragraph 17 is withdrawn or if the contracting parties concur in the measure proposed after the expiration of the ninety-day time limit specified in paragraph 17.ad article xxsub-paragraph (h)the exception provided for in this sub-paragraph extends to any commodity agreement which conforms to the principles approved by the economic and social council in its resolution 30(iv) of 28 march 1947.ad article xxivparagraph 9it is understood that the provisions of article i would require that, when a product which has been imported into the territory of a member of a customs union or free-trade area at a preferential rate of duty is re-exported to the territory of another member of such union or area, the latter member should collect a duty equal to the difference between the duty already paid and any higher duty that would be payable if the product were being imported directly into its territory.paragraph 11measures adopted by india and pakistan in order to carry out definitive trade arrangements between them, once they have been agreed upon, might depart from particular provisions of this agreement, but these measures would in general be consistent with the objectives of the agreement.ad article xxviiithe contracting parties and each contracting party concerned should arrange to conduct the negotiations and consultations with the greatest possible secrecy in order to avoid premature disclosure of details of prospective tariff changes. the contracting parties shall be informed immediately of all changes in national tariffs resulting from recourse to this article.paragraph 11. if the contracting parties specify a period other than a three-year period, a contracting party may act pursuant to paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 of article xxviii on the first day following the expiration of such other period and, unless the contracting parties have again specified another period, subsequent periods will be three-year periods following the expiration of such specified period.2. the provision that on 1 january 1958, and on other days determined pursuant to paragraph 1, a contracting party "may . . . modify or withdraw a concession" means that on such day, and on the first day after the end of each period, the legal obligation of such contracting party under article ii is altered; it does not mean that the changes in its customs tariff should necessarily be made effective on that day. if a tariff change resulting from negotiations undertaken pursuant to this article is delayed, the entry into force of any compensatory concessions may be similarly delayed.3. not earlier than six months, not later than three months, prior to 1 january 1958, or to the termination date of any subsequent period, a contracting party wishing to modify or withdraw any concession embodied in the appropriate schedule, should notify the contracting parties to this effect. the contracting parties shall then determine the contracting party or contracting parties with which the negotiations or consultations referred to in paragraph 1 shall take place. any contracting party so determined shall participate in such negotiations or consultations with the applicant contracting party with the aim of reaching agreement before the end of the period. any extension of the assured life of the schedules shall relate to the schedules as modified after such negotiations, in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of article xxviii. if the contracting parties are arranging for multilateral tariff negotiations to take place within the period of six months before 1 january 1958, or before any other day determined pursuant to paragraph 1, they shall include in the arrangements for such negotiations suitable procedures for carrying out the negotiations referred to in this paragraph.4. the object of providing for the participation in the negotiations of any contracting party with a principal supplying interest, in addition to any contracting party with which the concession was initially negotiated, is to ensure that a contracting party with a larger share in the trade affected by the concession than a contracting party with which the concession was initially negotiated shall have an effective opportunity to protect the contracting right which it enjoys under this agreement. on the other hand, it is not intended that the scope of the negotiations should be such as to make negotiations and agreement under article xxviii unduly difficult nor to create complications in the application of this article in the future to concessions which result from negotiations thereunder. accordingly, the contracting parties should only determine that a contracting party has a principal supplying interest if that contracting party has had, over a reasonable period of time prior to the negotiations, a larger share in the market of the applicant contracting party than a contracting party with which the concession was initially negotiated or would, in the judgment of the contracting parties, have had such a share in the absence of discriminatory quantitative restrictions maintained by the applicant contracting party. it would therefore not be appropriate for the contracting parties to determine that more than one contracting party, or in those exceptional cases where there is near equality more than two contracting parties, had a principal supplying interest.5. notwithstanding the definition of a principal supplying interest in note 4 to paragraph 1, the contracting parties may exceptionally determine that a contracting party has a principal supplying interest if the concession in question affects trade which constitutes a major part of the total exports of such contracting party.6. it is not intended that provision for participation in the negotiations of any contracting party with a principal supplying interest, and for consultation with any contracting party having a substantial interest in the concession which the applicant contracting party is seeking to modify or withdraw, should have the effect that it should have to pay compensation or suffer retaliation greater than the withdrawal or modification sought, judged in the light of the conditions of trade at the time of the proposed withdrawal or modification, making allowance for any discriminatory quantitative restrictions maintained by the applicant contracting party.7. the expression "substantial interest" is not capable of a precise definition and accordingly may present difficulties for the contracting parties. it is, however, intended to be construed to cover only those contracting parties which have, or in the absence of discriminatory quantitative restrictions affecting their exports could reasonably be expected to have, a significant share in the market of the contracting party seeking to modify or withdraw the concession.paragraph 41. any request for authorization to enter into negotiations shall be accompanied by all relevant statistical and other data. a decision on such request shall be made within thirty days of its submission.2. it is recognized that to permit certain contracting parties, depending in large measure on a relatively small number of primary commodities and relying on the tariff as an important aid for furthering diversification of their economies or as an important source of revenue, normally to negotiate for the modification or withdrawal of concessions only under paragraph 1 of article xxviii, might cause them at such a time to make modifications or withdrawals which in the long run would prove unnecessary. to avoid such a situation the contracting parties shall authorize any such contracting party, under paragraph 4, to enter into negotiations unless they consider this would result in, or contribute substantially towards, such an increase in tariff levels as to threaten the stability of the schedules to this agreement or lead to undue disturbance of international trade.3. it is expected that negotiations authorized under paragraph 4 for modification or withdrawal of a single item, or a very small group of items, could normally be brought to a conclusion in sixty days. it is recognized, however, that such a period will be inadequate for cases involving negotiations for the modification or withdrawal of a larger number of items and in such cases, therefore, it would be appropriate for the contracting parties to prescribe a longer period.4. the determination referred to in paragraph 4(d) shall be made by the contracting parties within thirty days of the submission of the matter to them unless the applicant contracting party agrees to a longer period.5. in determining under paragraph 4(d) whether an applicant contracting party has unreasonably failed to offer adequate compensation, it is understood that the contracting parties will take due account of the special position of a contracting party which has bound a high proportion of its tariffs at very low rates of duty and to this extent has less scope than other contracting parties to make compensatory adjustment.ad article xxviii bisparagraph 3it is understood that the reference to fiscal needs would include the revenue aspect of duties and particularly duties imposed primarily for revenue purpose, or duties imposed on products which can be substituted for products subject to revenue duties to prevent the avoidance of such duties.ad article xxixparagraph 1 ARTICLE s vii and viii of the havana charter have been excluded form paragraph 1 because they generally deal with the organization, functions and procedures of the international trade organization.ad part ivthe words "developed contracting parties" and the words "less-developed contracting parties" as used in part iv are to be understood to refer to developed and less-developed countries which are parties to the general agreement on tariffs and trade.ad article xxxviparagraph 1this article is based upon the objectives set forth in article i as it will be amended by section a of paragraph 1 of the protocol amending part i and articles xxix and xxx when that protocol enters into force.[5]paragraph 4the term "primary products" includes agricultural products, vide paragraph 2 of the note ad article xvi, section b.paragraph 5a diversification programme would generally include the intensification of activities for the processing of primary products and the development of manufacturing industries, taking into account the situation of the particular contracting party and the world outlook for production and consumption of different commodities.paragraph 8it is understood that the phrase "do not expect reciprocity" means, in accordance with the objectives set forth in this article, that the less-developed contracting parties should not be expected, in the course of trade negotiations, to make contributions which are inconsistent with their individual development, financial and trade needs, taking into consideration past trade developments.this paragraph would apply in the event of action under section a of article xviii, article xxviii, article xxviii bis (article xxix after the amendment set forth in section a of paragraph 1 of the protocol amending part i and articles xxix and xxx shall have become effective), article xxxiii, or any other procedure under this agreement.ad article xxxviiparagraph 1(a)this paragraph would apply in the event of negotiations for reduction or elimination of tariffs or other restrictive regulations of commerce under articles xxviii, xxviii bis (xxix after the amendment set forth in section a of paragraph 1 of the protocol amending part i and articles xxix and xxx shall have become effective), and article xxxiii, as well as in connexion with other action to effect such reduction or elimination which contracting parties may be able to undertake.paragraph 3(b)the other measures referred to in this paragraph might include steps to promote domestic structural changes, to encourage the consumption of particular products, or to introduce measures of trade promotion.[1] following is text of agreement, as annexed to the final act adopted at the conclusion of the second session of the preparatory committee of the united
