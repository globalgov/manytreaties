through water, through the atmosphere or directly from the coast ARTICLE iiigeneral obligationsthe high contracting parties shall, either individually or through bilateral or multilateral cooperation. endeavour to adopt appropriate measures in accordance with the provisions of this protocol to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from land-based sources, which results or is likely to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine life, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea, impairment of quality for the use of sea water and reduction of amenities.the high contracting parties shall adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine
