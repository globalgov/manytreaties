treaty between the united states and great britain relating to boundary waters, and questions arising between the united states and canadasource: unofficialthe united states of america and his majesty the king of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the seas, emperor of india, being equally desirous to prevent disputes regarding the use of boundary waters and to settle all questions which are now pending between the united states and the dominion of canada involving the rights, obligations, or interests of either in relation to the other or to the inhabitants of the other, along their common frontier, and to make provision for the adjustment and settlement of all such questions as may hereafter arise, have resolved to conclude a treaty in furtherance of these ends, and for that purpose have appointed as their respective plenipotentiaries:the president of the united states of america, elihu root, secretary of state of the united states; and his britannic majesty, the right honourable james bryce, o.m., his ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary at washington;who, after having communicated to one another their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:preliminary articlefor the purpose of this treaty boundary waters are defined as the waters from main shore to main shore of the lakes and rivers and connecting waterways, or the portions thereof, along which the international boundary between the united states and the dominion of canada passes, including all bays, arms, and inlets thereof, but not including tributary waters which in their natural channels would flow into such lakes, rivers, and waterways, or waters flowing from such lakes, rivers, and waterways, or the waters of rivers flowing across the boundary ARTICLE ithe high contracting parties agree that the navigation of all navigable boundary waters shall forever continue free and open for the purposes of commerce to the inhabitants and to the ships, vessels, and boats of both countries equally, subject, however, to any laws and regulations of either country, within its own territory, not inconsistent with such privilege of free navigation and applying equally and without discrimination to the inhabitants, ships, vessels, and boats of both countries.it is further agreed that so long as this treaty shall remain in force, this same right of navigation shall extend to the waters of lake michigan and to all canals connecting boundary waters, and now existing or which may hereafter be constructed on either side of the line. either of the high contracting parties may adopt rules and regulations governing the use of such canals within its own territory and may charge tolls for the use thereof, but all such rules and regulations and all tolls charged shall apply alike to the subjects or citizens of the high contracting parties and the ships, vessels, and boats of both of the high contracting parties, and they shall be placed on terms of equality in the use thereof ARTICLE iieach of the high contracting parties reserves to itself or to the several state governments on the one side and the dominion or provincial governments on the other as the case may be, subject to any treaty provisions now existing with respect thereto, the exclusive jurisdiction and control over the use and diversion, whether temporary or permanent, of all waters on its own side of the line which in their natural channels would flow across the boundary or into boundary waters; but it is agreed that any interference with or diversion from their natural channel of such waters on either side of the boundary, resulting in any injury on the other side of the boundary, shall give rise to the same rights and entitle the injured parties to the same legal remedies as if such injury took place in the country where such diversion or interference occurs; but this provision shall not apply to cases already existing or to cases expressly covered by special agreement between the parties hereto. it is understood however, that neither of the high contracting parties intends by the foregoing provision to surrender any right, which it may have, to object to any interference with or diversions of waters on the other side of the boundary the effect of which would be productive of material injury to the navigation interests on its own side of the boundary ARTICLE iiiit is agreed that, in addition to the uses, obstructions, and diversions heretofore permitted or hereafter provided for by special agreement between the parties hereto, no further or other uses or obstructions or diversions, whether temporary or permanent, of boundary waters on either side of the line, affecting the natural level or flow of boundary waters on the other side of the line shall be mae except by authority of the united states or the dominion of canada within their respective jurisdictions and with the approval, as hereinafter provided, of a joint commission, to be known as the international joint commission.the foregoing provisions are not intended to limit or interfere with the existing rights of the government of the united states on the one side and the government of the dominion of canada on the other, to undertake and carry on governmental works in boundary waters for the deepening of channels, the construction of breakwaters, the improvement of harbours, and other governmental works for the benefit of commerce and navigation, provided that such works are wholly on its own side of the line and do not materially affect the level or flow of the boundary waters on the other, nor are such provisions intended to interfere with the ordinary use of such waters for domestic and sanitary purposes ARTICLE ivthe high contracting parties agree that, except in cases provided for by special agreement between them, they will not permit the construction of maintenance on their respective sides of the boundary of any remedial or protective works or any dams or other obstructions in waters flowing from boundary waters or in waters at a lower level than the boundary in rivers flowing across the boundary, the effect of which is to raise the natural level of waters on the other side of the boundary unless the construction or maintenance thereof is approved by the aforesaid international joint commission.it is further agreed that the waters herein defined as boundary waters and waters flowing across the boundary shall not be polluted on either side to the injury of health or property on the other ARTICLE vthe high contracting parties agree that it is expedient to limit the diversion of waters from the niagara river so that the level of lake erie and the flow of the stream shall not be appreciably affected. it is the desire of both parties to accomplish this object with the least possible injury to investments which have already been made in the construction of power plants on the united states side of the river under grants of authority from state of new york, and on the canadian side of the river under licences authorized by the dominion of canada and the province of ontario.so long as this treaty shall remain in force, no diversion of the waters of the niagara river above the falls from the natural course and stream thereof shall be permitted except for the purposes and to the extent hereinafter provided.the united states may authorize and permit the diversion within the state of new york of the waters of said river above the falls of niagara, for power purposes, not exceeding in the aggregate a daily diversion at the rate of twenty thousand cubic feet of water per second.the united kingdom, by the dominion of canada, or the province of ontario, may authorize and permit the diversion within the province of ontario of the waters of said rive above the falls of niagara, for the power purposes, not exceeding in the aggregate a daily diversion at the rate of thirty-six thousand cubic feet of water per second.the prohibitions of this article shall not apply to the diversion of water for sanitary or domestic purposes, or for the service of canals for the purposes of navigation.note: the third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of article v were terminated by the canada-united states treaty of february 27, 1950 concerning the diversion of the niagara river ARTICLE vithe high contracting parties agree that the st. mary and milk rivers and their tributaries (in the state of montana and the provinces of alberta and saskatchewan) are to be treated as one stream for the purposes of irrigation and power, and the waters thereof shall be apportioned equally between the two countries, but in making such equal apportionment more than half may be taken from one river and less than half from the other by either country so as to afford a more beneficial use to each. it is further agreed that in the division of such waters during the irrigation season, between the 1st of april and 31st of october, inclusive, annually, the united states is entitled to a prior appropriation of 500 cubic feet per second of the waters of the milk river, or so much of such amount as constitutes three-fourths of its natural flow, and that canada is entitled to a prior appropriation of 500 cubic feet per second of the flow of st. mary river, or so much of such amount as constitutes three-fourths of its natural flow.the channel of the milk river in canada may be used at the convenience of the united states for the conveyance, while passing through canadian territory, of waters diverted from the st. mary river. the provisions of article ii of this treaty shall apply to any injury resulting to property in canada from the conveyance of such waters through the milk river.the measurement and apportionment of the water to be used by each country shall from time to time be made jointly by the properly constituted reclamation officers of the united states and the properly constituted irrigation officers of his majesty under the direction of the international joint commission ARTICLE viithe high contracting parties agree to establish and maintain an international joint commission of the untied states and canada composed of six commissioners, three on the part of the united states appointed by the president thereof, and three on the part of the united kingdom appointed by his majesty on the recommendation of the governor in council of the dominion of canada ARTICLE viiithis international joint commission shall have jurisdiction over and shall pass upon all cases involving the use or obstruction or diversion of the waters with respect to which under article iii or iv of this treaty the approval shall be governed by the following rules of principles which are adopted by the high contracting parties for this purpose:the high contracting parties shall have, each on its own side of the boundary, equal and similar rights in the use of the waters hereinbefore defined as boundary waters.the following order of precedence shall be observed among the various uses enumerated hereinafter for these waters, and no use shall be permitted which tends materially to conflict with or restrain any other use which is given preference over it in this order of precedence:1. uses for domestic and sanitary purposes;2. uses for navigation, including the service of canals for the purposes of navigation;3. uses for power and for irrigation purposes.the foregoing provisions shall not apply to or disturb any existing uses of boundary waters on either side of the boundary. the requirement for an equal division may in the discretion of the commission be suspended in cases of temporary diversions along boundary waters at points where such equal division can not be made advantageously on account of local conditions, and where such diversion does not diminish elsewhere the amount available for use on the other side.the commission in its discretion may make its approval in any case conditional upon the construction of remedial or protective works to compensate so far as possible for the particular use or diversion proposed, and in such cases may require that suitable and adequate provision, approved by the commission, be made for the protection and indemnity against injury of all interests on the other side of the line which may be injured thereby.in cases involving the elevation of the natural level of waters on either side of the line as a result of the construction or maintenance on the other side of remedial or protective works or dams or other obstructions in boundary waters flowing there from or in waters below the boundary in rivers flowing across the boundary, the commission shall require, as a condition of its approval thereof, that suitable and adequate provision, approved by it, be made for the protection and indemnity of all interests on the other side of the line which may be injured thereby.the majority of the commissioners shall have power to render a decision. in case the commission is evenly divided upon any question or matter presented to it for decision, separate reports shall be made by the commissioners on each side to their own government. the high contracting parties shall thereupon endeavour to agree upon an adjustment of the question or matter of difference, and if an agreement is reached between them, it shall be reduced to writing in the form of a protocol, and shall be communicated to the commissioners, who shall take such further proceedings as may be necessary to carry out such agreement ARTICLE ixthe high contracting parties further agree that any other questions or matters of difference arising between them involving the rights, obligations, or interests of either in relation to the other or to the inhabitants of the other, along the common frontier between the united states and the dominion of canada,

shall request that such questions or matters of difference be so referred.the international joint commission is authorized in each case so referred to examine into and report upon the facts and circumstances of the particular questions and matters referred, together with such conclusions and recommendations as may be appropriate, subject, however, to any restrictions or exceptions which may

and shall in no way have the character of an arbitral award.the commission shall make a joint report to both governments in all cases in which all or a majority of the commissioners agree, and in case of disagreement the minority may make a joint report to both governments, or separate reports to their respective governments.in case the commission is evenly divided upon any question or matter
