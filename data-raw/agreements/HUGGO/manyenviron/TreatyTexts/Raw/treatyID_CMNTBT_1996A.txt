aspects,underlining the importance of the full and prompt implementation of such agreements and measures,convinced that the present international situation provides an opportunity to take further effective measures towards nuclear disarmament and against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, and declaring their intention to take such measures,stressing therefore the need for continued systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons, and of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control,recognizing that the cessation of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, constitutes an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects,further recognizing that an end to all such nuclear explosions will thus constitute a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament,convinced that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing is through the conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, which has long been one of the highest priority objectives of the international community in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation,noting the aspirations expressed by the parties to the 1963 treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of nuclear weapons for all time,noting also the views expressed that this treaty could contribute to the protection of the environment,affirming the purpose of attracting the adherence of all states to this treaty and its objective to contribute effectively to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace and security,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE ibasic

for international data centre standard event screening1. the international data centre standard event screening criteria shall be based on the standard event characterisation parameters determined during the combined processing of data from all the monitoring technologies in the international monitoring system. standard event screening shall make use of both global and supplementary screening criteria to take account of regional variations where applicable.2. for events detected by the international monitoring system seismic component, the following parameters, inter alia, may be used:location of the event;depth of the event;ratio of the magnitude of surface waves to body waves;signal frequency content;spectral ratios of phases;spectral scalloping;first motion of the p-wave;focal mechanism;relative excitation of seismic phases;comparative measures to other events and groups of events; andregional discriminants where applicable.3. for events detected by the international monitoring system hydroacoustic component, the following parameters, inter alia, may be used:signal frequency content including corner frequency, wide-band energy and mean centre frequency and bandwidth;frequency-dependent duration of signals;spectral ratio; andindications of bubble-pulse signals and bubble-pulse delay.4. for events detected by the international monitoring system infrasound component, the following parameters, inter alia, may be used:signal frequency content and dispersion;signal duration; andpeak amplitude.5. for events detected by the international monitoring system radionuclide component, the following parameters, inter alia, may be used:concentration of background natural and man-made radionuclides;concentration of specific fission and activation products outside normal observations; andratios of one specific fission and activation product to another.
