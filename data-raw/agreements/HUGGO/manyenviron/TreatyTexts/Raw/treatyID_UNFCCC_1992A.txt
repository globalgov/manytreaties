united nations framework convention on climate changesource: the parties to this convention,acknowledging that change in the earth's climate and its adverse effects are a common concern of humankind,concerned that human activities have been substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, that these increases enhance the natural greenhouse effect, and that this will result on average in an additional warming of the earth's surface and atmosphere and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and humankind,noting that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs,aware of the role and importance in terrestrial and marine ecosystems of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases,noting that there are many uncertainties in predictions of climate change, particularly with regard to the timing, magnitude and regional patterns thereof,acknowledging that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions,recalling the pertinent provisions of the declaration of the united nations conference on the human environment, adopted at stockholm on 16 june 1972,recalling also that states have, in accordance with the charter of the united nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,reaffirming the principle of sovereignty of states in international cooperation to address climate change,recognizing that states should enact effective environmental legislation, that environmental standards, management objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply, and that standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular developing countries,recalling the provisions of general assembly resolution 44/ 228 of 22 december 1989 on the united nations conference on environment and development, and resolutions 43/ 53 of 6 december 1988, 44/ 207 of 22 december 1989, 45/ 212 of 21 december 1990 and 46/ 169 of 19 december 1991 on protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind,recalling also the provisions of general assembly resolution 44/ 206 of 22 december 1989 on the possible adverse effects of sea-level rise on islands and coastal areas, particularly low-lying coastal areas and the pertinent provisions of general assembly resolution 44/ 172 of 19 december 1989 on the implementation of the plan of action to combat desertification,recalling further the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer, 1985, and the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, 1987, as adjusted and amended on 29 june 1990,noting the ministerial declaration of the second world climate conference adopted on 7 november 1990,conscious of the valuable analytical work being conducted by many states on climate change and of the important contributions of the world meteorological organization, the united nations environment programme and other organs, organizations and bodies of the united nations system, as well as other international and intergovernmental bodies, to the exchange of results of scientific research and the coordination of research,recognizing that steps required to understand and address climate change will be environmentally, socially and economically most effective if they are based on relevant scientific, technical and economic considerations and continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in these areas,recognizing that various actions to address climate change can be justified economically in their own right and can also help in solving other environmental problems,recognizing also the need for developed countries to take immediate action in a flexible manner on the basis of clear priorities, as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies at the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels that take into account all greenhouse gases, with due consideration of their relative contributions to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect,recognizing further that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,recognizing the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation, as a consequence of action taken on limiting greenhouse gas emissions,affirming that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty,recognizing that all countries, especially developing countries, need access to resources required to achieve sustainable social and economic development and that, in order for developing countries to progress towards that goal, their energy consumption will need to grow taking into account the possibilities for achieving greater energy efficiency and for controlling greenhouse gas emissions in general, including through the application of new technologies on terms which make such an application economically and socially beneficial,determined to protect the climate system for present and future generations,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1definitionsfor the purposes of this convention:1. "adverse effects of climate change" means changes in the physical environment or biota resulting from climate change which have significant deleterious effects on the composition, resilience or productivity of natural and managed ecosystems or on the operation of socio-economic systems or on human health and welfare.2. "climate change" means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.3. "climate system" means the totality of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and geosphere and their interactions.4. "emissions" means the release of greenhouse gases and/ or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time.5. "greenhouse gases" means those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation.6. "regional economic integration organization" means an organization constituted by sovereign states of a given region which has competence in respect of matters governed by this convention or its protocols and has been duly authorized, in accordance with its internal procedures, to sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to the instruments concerned.7. "reservoir" means a component or components of the climate system where a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored.8. "sink" means any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.9. "source" means any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere ARTICLE 2objectivethe ultimate objective of this convention and any related legal instruments that the conference of the parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner ARTICLE 3principlesin their actions to achieve the objective of the convention and to implement its provisions, the parties shall be guided, inter alia, by the following:1. the parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. accordingly, the developed country parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.2. the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those parties, especially developing country parties, that would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the convention, should be given full consideration.3. the parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that policies and measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost. to achieve this, such policies and measures should take into account different socio-economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors. efforts to address climate change may be carried out cooperatively by interested parties.4. the parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development. policies and measures to protect the climate system against human-induced change should be appropriate for the specific conditions of each party and should be integrated with national development programmes, taking into account that economic development is essential for adopting measures to address climate change.5. the parties should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development in all parties, particularly developing country parties, thus enabling them better to address the problems of climate change. measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones,should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade ARTICLE 4commitments1. all parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances, shall:(a) develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the conference of the parties, in accordance with article 12, national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol, using comparable methodologies to be agreed upon by the conference of the parties;(b) formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where

take corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs. these policies and measures will demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the convention, recognizing that the return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol would contribute to such modification, and taking into account the differences in these parties' starting points and approaches, economic structures and resource bases, the need to maintain strong and sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual circumstances, as well as the need for equitable and appropriate contributions by each of these parties to the global effort regarding that objective. these parties may implement such policies and measures jointly with other parties and may assist other parties in contributing to the achievement of the objective of the convention and, in particular, that of this subparagraph;(b) in order to promote progress to this end, each of these parties shall communicate, within six months of the entry into force of the convention for it and periodically thereafter, and in accordance with article 12, detailed information on its policies and measures referred to in subparagraph (a) above, as well as on its resulting projected anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol for the period referred to in subparagraph (a), with the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol. this information will be reviewed by the conference of the parties, at its first session and periodically thereafter, in accordance with article 7;(c) calculations of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases for the purposes of subparagraph (b) above should take into account the best available scientific knowledge, including of the effective capacity of sinks and the respective contributions of such gases to

the adoption of amendments to the commitments in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. the conference of the parties, at its first session, shall also take decisions regarding criteria for joint implementation as indicated in subparagraph (a) above. a second review of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall take place not later than 31 december 1998, and thereafter at regular intervals determined by the conference of the parties, until the objective of the convention is met;(e) each of these parties shall :(i) coordinate as appropriate with other such parties, relevant economic and administrative instruments developed to achieve the objective of the convention; and(ii) identify and periodically review its own policies and practices which encourage activities that lead to greater levels of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol than would otherwise occur;(f) the conference of the parties shall review, not later than 31 december 1998, available information with a view to taking decisions regarding such amendments to the lists in annexes i and ii as may be appropriate, with the approval of the party concerned;(g) any party not included in annex i may, in its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any time thereafter, notify the depositary that it intends to be bound by subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. the depositary shall inform the other signatories and parties of any such notification.3. the developed country parties and other developed parties included in annex ii shall provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing country parties in complying with their obligations under article 12, paragraph 1. they shall also provide such financial resources, including for the transfer of technology, needed by the developing country parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures that are covered by paragraph 1 of this article and that are agreed between a developing country party and the international entity or entities referred to in article 11, in accordance with that article. the implementation of these commitments shall take into account the need for adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds and the importance of appropriate burden sharing among the developed country parties.4. the developed country parties and other developed parties included in annex ii shall also assist the developing country parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.5. the developed country parties and other developed parties included in annex ii shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other parties, particularly developing country parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the convention. in this process, the developed country parties shall support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country parties. other parties and organizations in a position to do so may also assist in facilitating the transfer of such technologies.6. in the implementation of their commitments under paragraph 2 above, a certain degree of flexibility shall be allowed by the conference of the parties to the parties included in annex i undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, in order to enhance the ability of these parties to address climate change, including with regard to the historical level of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the montreal protocol chosen as a reference.7. the extent to which developing country parties will effectively implement their commitments under the convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country parties of their commitments under the convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country parties.8. in the implementation of the commitments in this article, the parties shall give full consideration to what actions are necessary under the convention, including actions related to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology, to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country parties arising from the adverse effects of climate change and/ or the impact of the implementation of response measures, especially on:(a) small island countries;(b) countries with low-lying coastal areas;(c) countries with
