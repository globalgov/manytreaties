fish stocks in order to protect the living marine resources and preserve the marine environment.2. states shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. the absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.3. in implementing the precautionary approach, states shall:(a) improve decision-making for fishery resource conservation and management by obtaining and sharing the best scientific information available and implementing improved techniques for dealing with risk and uncertainty;(b) apply the guidelines set out in annex ii and determine, on the basis of the best scientific information available, stock-specific reference points and the action to be taken if they are exceeded;(c) take into account inter alia, uncertainties relating to the size and productivity of the stocks, reference points, stock condition in relation to such reference points, levels and distributions of fishing mortality and the impact of fishing activities on non-target and associated or dependent species, as well as existing and predicted oceanic, environmental and

violation.6. the flag state shall respond to the notification referred to under paragraph 5 within three working days of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2, and shall either:(a) fulfil, without delay, its obligations under article 19 to investigate and, if evidence so warrants, take enforcement action with respect to the vessel, in which case it shall promptly inform the inspecting state of the results of the investigation and of any enforcement action taken; or(b) authorize the inspecting state to investigate.7. where the flag state authorizes the inspecting state to investigate an alleged violation, the inspecting state shall, without delay, communicate the results of that investigation to the flag state. the flag state shall, if evidence so warrants, fulfil its obligations to take enforcement action with respect to the vessel. alternatively, the flag state may authorize the inspecting state to take such enforcement action as the flag state may specify with respect to the vessel, consistent with the rights and obligations of the flag state under this agreement.8. where, following a boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a serious violation, and the flag state has either failed to respond or failed to take action as required under paragraphs 6 or 7, the inspectors may remain on board and secure evidence and may require the master to assist in further investigation including, where appropriate, by bringing the vessel without delay to the nearest appropriate port, or to such other port as may be specified in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2. the inspecting state shall immediately inform the flag state of the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. the inspecting state and the flag state and, as appropriate, the port state shall take all necessary steps to ensure the well-being of the crew regardless of their nationality.9. the inspecting state shall inform the flag state and the relevant organization or the participants in the relevant arrangement of the results of any further investigation.10. the inspecting state shall require its inspectors to observe international rules and generally accepted practices and procedures relating to the safety of the vessel and the crew, minimize interference with fishing operations and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. inspecting states shall ensure that boarding and inspection is not conducted in a manner that would constitute harassment of any fishing vessel.11. for the purposes of this article, a serious violation means:(a) fishing without a valid licence, authorization or permit issued by the flag state in accordance with article 18, paragraph 3(a);(b) failing to maintain accurate records of catch and catch-related data, as required by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, or serious misreporting of catch, contrary to the catch reporting requirements of such organization or arrangement;(c) fishing in a closed area, fishing during a closed season or fishing without, or after attainment of, a quota established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement;(d) directed fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;(e) using prohibited fishing gear;(f) falsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;(g) concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;(h) multiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures; or(i) such other violations as may be specified in procedures established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement.12. notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the flag state may, at any time, take action to fulfil its obligations under article 19 with respect to an alleged violation. where the vessel is under the direction of the inspecting state, the inspecting state shall, at the request of the flag state, release the vessel to the flag state along with full information on the progress and outcome of its investigation.13. this article is without prejudice to the right of the flag state to take any measures, including proceedings to impose penalties, according to its laws.14. this article applies mutatis mutandis to boarding and inspection by a state party which is a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement and which has clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel flying the flag of another state party has engaged in any activity contrary to relevant conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1 in the high seas area covered by such organization or arrangement, and such vessel has subsequently, during the same fishing trip, entered into an area under the national jurisdiction of the inspecting state.15. where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement has established an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligation under this agreement of the members of such organization or the participants in such an arrangement to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by the organization or arrangement, members of, or participants in, such organization or arrangement may agree to limit the application of paragraph 1 as between themselves in respect of the conservation and management measures which have been established in the relevant high seas area.16. action taken by states other than the flag state in respect of vessels having engaged in activities contrary to subregional or regional conservation and management measures shall be proportional to the seriousness of the violation.17. where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a fishing vessel on the high seas is without nationality, a state may board and inspect the vessel. where evidence so warrants, the state may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law.18. states shall be liable for damage or loss attributable to them arising from action taken pursuant to this article when such action is unlawful or exceeds that reasonably required in the light of available information to implement the provisions of this article ARTICLE 22basic procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to article 211. the inspecting state shall ensure that its duly authorized inspectors:(a) present credentials to the master of the vessel and produce a copy of the text of the relevant conservation and management measures or rules and regulations in force in the high seas area in question pursuant to those measures;(b) initiate notice to the flag state at the time of the boarding and inspection;(c) do not interfere with the master's ability to communicate with the authorities of the flag state during the boarding and inspection;(d) provide a copy of a report on the boarding and inspection to the master and to the authorities of the flag state, noting thereon any objection or statement which the master wishes to have included in the report;(e) promptly leave the vessel following completion of the inspection if they find no evidence of a serious violation; and(f) avoid the use of force except when and to the degree necessary to ensure the safety of the inspectors and where the inspectors are obstructed in the execution of their duties. the degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances.2. the duly authorized inspectors of an inspecting state shall have the authority to inspect the vessel, its licence, gear, equipment, records, fish products and any relevant documents necessary to verify compliance with the relevant conservation and management measures.3. the flag state shall ensure that vessel masters:(a) accept and facilitate prompt and safe boarding by the inspectors;(b) cooperate with and assist in the inspection of the vessel conducted pursuant to these procedures;(c) do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the inspectors in the performance of their duties;(d) allow the inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag state and the inspecting state during the boarding and inspection;(e) provide reasonable facilities, including, where appropriate, food and accommodation, to the inspectors; and(f) facilitate safe disembarkation by the inspectors.4. in the event that the master of a vessel refuses to accept boarding and inspection in accordance with this article and article 21, the flag state shall, except in circumstances where, in accordance with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to safety at sea, it is necessary to delay the boarding and inspection, direct the master of the vessel to submit immediately to boarding and inspection and, if the master does not comply with such direction, shall suspend the vessels authorization to fish and order the vessel to return immediately to port. the flag state shall advise the inspecting state of the action it has taken when the circumstances referred to in this paragraph arise ARTICLE 23measures taken by a port state1. a port state has the right and the duty to take measures, in accordance with international law, to promote the effectiveness of subregional, regional and global conservation and management measures. when taking such measures a port state shall not discriminate in form or in fact against the vessels of any state.2. a port state may, inter alia, inspect documents, fishing gear and catch on board fishing vessels, when such vessels are voluntarily in its ports or at its offshore terminals.3. states may adopt regulations empowering the relevant national authorities to prohibit landings and transshipments where it has been established that the catch has been taken in a manner which undermines the effectiveness of subregional, regional or global conservation and management measures on the high seas.4. nothing in this article affects the exercise by states of their sovereignty over ports in their territory in accordance with international law.part viirequirements of developing states

french, russian and spanish languages ANNEX istandard requirements for collection and sharing of data ARTICLE 1general principles1. the timely collection, compilation and analysis of data are fundamental to effective conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. to this end, data from fisheries for these stocks on the high seas and those in areas under national jurisdiction are required and should be collected and compiled in such a way as to enable statistically meaningful analysis for the purposes of fishery resource conservation and management. these data include catch and fishing effort statistics and other fishery-related information, such as vessel-related and other data for standardizing fishing effort. data collected should also include information on non-target and associated and dependent species. all data should be verified to ensure accuracy. confidentiality of non-aggregated data shall be maintained. the dissemination of such data shall be subject to the terms on which they have been provided.2. assistance, including training and financial and technical assistance, shall be provided to developing states in order to build capacity in the field of conservation and management of living marine resources. assistance should focus on enhancing capacity to implement data collection and verification, observer programmes, data analysis and research projects supporting stock assessments. the fullest possible involvement of developing state scientists and managers in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks should be promoted ARTICLE 2principles of data collection, compilation and exchangethe following general principles should be considered in defining the parameters for collection, compilation and exchange of data from fishing operations for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks:(a) states should ensure that data are collected from vessels flying their flag on fishing activities according to the operational characteristics of each fishing method (e.g. each individual tow for trawl, each set for long-line and purse-seine, each school fished for pole-and-line and each day fished for troll) and in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment;(b) states should ensure that fishery data are verified through an appropriate system;(c) states should compile fishery-related and other supporting scientific data and provide them in an agreed format and in a timely manner to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement where one exists. otherwise, states should cooperate to exchange data directly or through such other cooperative mechanisms as may be agreed among them;(d) states should agree, within the framework of subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, or otherwise, on the specification of data and the format in which they are accordance with this annex and taking into account the nature of the stocks and the fisheries for those stocks in the region. such organizations or arrangements should request non-members or non-participants to provide data concerning relevant fishing activities by vessels flying their flag;(e) such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and in an agreed format to all interested states under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement; and(f) scientists of the flag state and from the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement should analyze the data separately or jointly, as appropriate ARTICLE 3basic fishery data1. states shall collect and make available to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement the following types of data in sufficient detail to facilitate effective stock assessment in accordance with agreed procedures:(a) time series of catch and effort statistics by fisheries and fleet;(b) total catch in number, nominal weight, or both, by species (both target and non-target) as is appropriate to each fishery. [nominal weight is defined by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations as the live-weight equivalent of the landings];(c) discard statistics, including estimates where necessary, reported as number or nominal weight by species, as is appropriate to each fishery;(d) effort statistics appropriate to each fishing method; and(e) fishing location, date and time fished and other statistics on fishing operations as appropriate.2. states shall also collect where appropriate and provide to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement information to support stock assessment, including:(a) composition of the catch according to length, weight and sex;(b) other biological information supporting stock assessments such as information on age, growth, recruitment, distribution and stock identity; and(c) other relevant research, including surveys of abundance, biomass surveys, hydro-acoustic surveys, research on environmental factors affecting stock abundance, and oceanographic and ecological studies ARTICLE 4vessel data and information1. states should collect the following types of vessel-related data for standardizing fleet composition and vessel fishing power and for converting between different measures of effort in the analysis of catch and effort data:(a) vessel identification, flag and port of registry;(b) vessel type;(c) vessel specifications (e.g. material of construction, date built, registered length, gross registered tonnage, power of main engines, hold capacity and catch storage methods); and(d) fishing gear description (e.g. types, gear specifications and quantity).2. the flag state will collect the following information:(a) navigation and position fixing aids;(b) communication equipment and international radio call sign; and(c) crew size ARTICLE 5reportinga state shall ensure that vessels flying its flag send to its national fisheries administration and, where agreed, to the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement, log book data on catch and effort, including data on fishing operations on the high seas, at sufficiently frequent intervals to meet national requirements and regional and international obligations. such data shall be transmitted, where necessary, by radio, telex, facsimile or satellite transmission or by other means ARTICLE 6data verificationstates or, as appropriate, subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements should establish mechanisms for verifying fishery data, such as:(a) position verification through vessel monitoring systems;(b) scientific observer programmes to monitor catch, effort, catch composition (target and non-target) and other details of fishing operations;(c) vessel trip, landing and transshipment reports; and(d) port sampling ARTICLE 7data exchange1. data collected by flag states must be shared with other flag states and relevant coastal states through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements. such organizations or arrangements shall compile data and make them available in a timely manner and n an agreed format to all interested states under the terms and conditions established by the organization or arrangement, while maintaining confidentiality of non-aggregated data, and should, to the extent feasible, develop database systems which provide efficient access to data.2. at the global level, collection and dissemination of data should be effected through the food and agriculture organization of the united nations. where a subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement does not exist, that organization may also do the same at the subregional or regional level by arrangement with the states concerned ANNEX iiguidelines for application of precautionary reference points in conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.1. a precautionary reference point is an estimated value derived through an agreed scientific procedure, which corresponds to the state of the resource and of the fishery, and which can be used as a guide for fisheries management2. two types of precautionary reference points should be used: conservation, or limit, reference points and management, or target, reference points. limit reference points set boundaries which are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits within which the stocks can produce maximum sustainable yield. target reference points are intended to meet management objectives.3. precautionary reference points should be stock-specific to account, inter alia, for the reproductive capacity, the resilience of each stock and the characteristics of fisheries exploiting the stock, as well as other sources of mortality and major sources of uncertainty.4. management strategies shall seek to maintain or restore populations of harvested stocks, and where necessary associated or dependent species, at levels consistent with previously agreed precautionary reference points. such reference points shall be used to trigger pre-agreed conservation and management action. management strategies shall include measures which can be implemented when precautionary reference points are approached.5. fishery management strategies shall ensure that the risk of exceeding limit reference points is very low. if a stock falls below a limit reference point or is at risk of falling below such a reference point, conservation and management action should be initiated to facilitate stock recovery. fishery management strategies shall ensure that target reference points are not exceeded on average.6. when information for determining reference points for a fishery is poor or absent, provisional reference points shall be set. provisional reference points may be established by analogy to similar and better-known stocks. in such situations, the fishery shall be subject to enhanced monitoring so as to enable revision of provisional reference points as improved information becomes available.7. the fishing mortality rate which generates maximum sustainable yield should be regarded as a minimum standard for limit reference points. for stocks which are not over-fished, fishery management strategies shall ensure that fishing mortality does not exceed that which corresponds to maximum sustainable yield, and that the biomass does not fall below a pre-defined threshold. for over-fished stocks, the biomass which would produce maximum sustainable yield can serve as a rebuilding target.
