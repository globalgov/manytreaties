with lawful fishing:a) in the case of a pipeline, or other sub-sea apparatus immediately following completion of the work of installation;b) in the case of a production platform, immediately following its removal;c) in any case when the competent state authority might reasonably require survey and clean-up ARTICLE vieach contracting state shall take all practicable measures to ensure that every offshore installation to be used in that part of the protocol area within its jurisdiction is certified by a certifying authority or its designer that it is safe and fit for the purpose for which it is to be used so as to ensure that it will not cause accidental damage to the marine environment ARTICLE viieach contracting state shall take all practicable measures to ensure the following:1. operators shall at all times have available to their offshore installations, in good working order, equipment and devices to minimize the risk of accidental pollution and to facilitate prompt response to a pollution emergency, in accordance with good oilfield or other relevant industry practice.2. any such plant or equipment not included as part of an installation for the purposes of article vi
