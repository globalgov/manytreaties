centre of concerns to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of
drought,
Reflecting the urgent concern of the international community, including
States and international organizations, about the adverse impacts of
desertification and drought,
Aware that arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas together account for a
significant proportion of the Earth's land area and are the habitat and source
of livelihood for a large segment of its population,
Acknowledging that desertification and drought are problems of global
dimension in that they affect all regions of the world and that joint action of
the international community is needed to combat desertification and/or mitigate
the effects of drought,
Noting the high concentration of developing countries, notably the least
developed countries, among those experiencing serious drought and/or
desertification, and the particularly tragic consequences of these phenomena in
Africa,
Noting also that desertification is caused by complex interactions among
physical, biological, political, social, cultural and economic factors,
Considering the impact of trade and relevant aspects of international
economic re1ations on the ability of affected countries to combat
desertification adequately,
Conscious that sustainable economic growth, social development and poverty
eradication are priorities of affected developing countries, particularly in
Africa, and are eeeentia1 to meeting sustainabi1ity objectives,
Mindful that desertification and drought affect sustainable development
through their interrelationships with important social problems such as poverty,
poor health and nutrition, lack of food security, and those arising from
migration, displacement of persons and demographic dynamics,
Appreciating the significance of the past efforts and experience of States
and international organizations in combating desertification and mitigating the
effects of drought, particularly in implementing the Plan of Action to Combat
Desertification which was adopted at the united Nations Conference on
Desertification in 1977,
Realizing that, despite efforts in the past, progress in combating
desertification and mitigating the effects of drought has not met expectations
and that a new and more effective approach is needed at all levels within the
framework of sustainable development,
Recognizing the validity and relevance of decisions adopted at the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development, particularly of Agenda 21 and
its chapter 12, which provide a basis for combating desertification,
Reaffirming in this light the commitments of developed countries as
contained in paragraph 13 of chapter 33 of Agenda 21,

it prescribed for Africa, and all other relevant United Nations resolutions,
decisions and programmes on desertification and drought, as well as relevant
declarations by African countries and those from other regions,
Reaffirming the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development which
states, in its Principle 2, that States have, in accordance with the Charter of
the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right
to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and
developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within
their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other
States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,
Recognizing that national Governments play a critical role in combating
desertification and mitigating the effects of drought and that progress in that
respect dep~nds on local implementation of action programmes in affected areas,
Recognizing also the importance and necessity of international cooperation
and partnership in combating desertification and mitigating the effects of
drought,
Recognizing further the importance of the prov~s~on to affecte~ developing
countries, particularly in Africa, of effective means, inter alia substantial
financial resources, including new and additional funding, and access to
technology, without which it will be difficult for them to implement fully their
commitments under this Convention,
EXpressing concern over the impact of desertification and drought on
affected countries in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus,
Stressing the important role played by women in regions affected by
desertification and/or drought, particularly in rural areas of developing
countries, and the importance of ensuring the full participation of both men and
women at all levels in programmes to combat desertification and mitigate the
effects of drought,
Emphasizing the special role of non-governmental organizations and other
major groups in programmes to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of
drought,
Bearing in mind the relationship between desertification and other
environmental problems of global dimension facing the international and national
communities,
Bearing also in mind the contribution that combating desertification can
make to achieving the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity and other related
environmental conventions,
Believing that strategies to combat desertification and mitigate the
effects of drought will be most effective if they are based on sound systematic
observation and rigorous scientific knowledge and if they are continuously reevaluated,
Recognizing the urgent need to improve the effectiveness and coordination
of international cooperation to facilitate the implementation of national plans
and priorities,
Determined to take appropriate action in combating desertification and
mitigating the effects of drought for the benefit of present and future
generations~
Have agreed as follows:
