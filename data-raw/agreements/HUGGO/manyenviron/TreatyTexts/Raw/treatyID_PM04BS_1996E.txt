potential impairment of marine ecosystems and sea-water uses1. effects on human health through pollution impact on:(a) edible marine organisms;(b) bathing waters;(c) aesthetics.2. effects on marine ecosystems, in particular living resources, endangered species and critical habitats.3. effects on other legitimate uses of the sea ANNEX iiiconditions of application to pollution transported through the atmospherethis annex defines the conditions of application of this protocol to pollution from land-based sources transported by the atmosphere in terms of article 4.1( b) are the following:1. this protocol shall apply to polluting discharges into the atmosphere under the following conditions:(a) the discharged substance is or could be transported to the mediterranean sea area under prevailing meteorological conditions;(b) the input of the substance into the mediterranean sea area is hazardous for the environment in relation to the quantities of the same substance reaching the area by other means.2. this protocol shall also apply to polluting discharges into the atmosphere affecting the mediterranean sea area from land-based sources within the territories of the parties and from fixed man-made offshore structures, subject to the provisions of article 4.2 of this protocol.3. in the case of pollution of the mediterranean sea area from land-based sources through the atmosphere, the provisions of articles 5 and 6 of this protocol shall apply progressively to appropriate substances and sources listed in annex i to this protocol as will be agreed by the parties.4. subject to the conditions specified in paragraph 1 of this annex, the provisions of article 7.1 of this protocol shall also apply to:(a) discharges -quantity and rate -of substances emitted to the atmosphere, on the basis of the information available to the contracting parties concerning the location and distribution of air pollution sources;(b) the content of hazardous substances in fuel and raw materials;(c) the efficiency of air pollution control technologies and more efficient manufacturing and fuel burning processes;(d) the application of hazardous substances in agriculture and forestry.5. the provisions of annex ii to this protocol shall apply to pollution through the atmosphere whenever appropriate. air pollution monitoring and modelling using acceptable common emission factors and methodologies shall be carried out in the assessment of atmospheric deposition of substances, as well as in the compilation of inventories of quantities and rates of pollutant emissions into the atmosphere from land-based sources.6. all articles, including parts thereof to this protocol not mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 5 above shall apply equally to pollution from land-based sources transported by the atmosphere wherever applicable and subject to the conditions specified in paragraph 1 of this annex ANNEX ivcriteria for the definition of best available techniques and best environmental practicea. best available techniques1. the use of the best available techniques shall emphasize the use of non-waste technology, if available.2. the term "best available techniques" means the latest stage of development (state of the art) of processes, of facilities or of methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a particular measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste. in determining whether a set of processes, facilities and methods of operation constitute the best available techniques in general or individual cases, special consideration shall be given to:(a) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have recently been successfully tried out;(b) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(c) the economic feasibility of such techniques;(d) time limits for installation in both new and existing plants;(e) the nature and volume of the discharges and emissions concerned.3. it therefore follows that what is "best available techniques" for a particular process will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.4. if the reduction of discharges and emissions resulting from the use of best available techniques does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.5. "techniques" include both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built, maintained, operated and dismantled.b. best environmental practice6. the term "best environmental practice" means the application of the most appropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies. in making a selection for individual cases, at least the following graduated range of measures should be considered:(a) the provision of information and education to the public and to users about the environmental consequences of choice of particular activities and choice of products, their use and ultimate disposal;(b) the development and application of codes of good environmental practice which cover all aspects of the activity in the product's life;(c) the mandatory application of labels informing users of environmental risks related to a product, its use and ultimate disposal;(d) saving resources, including energy;(e) making collection and disposal systems available to the public;(f) avoiding the use of hazardous substances or products and the generation of hazardous waste;(g) recycling, recovery and re-use;(h) the application of economic instruments to activities, products or groups of products;(i) establishing a system of licensing, involving a range of restrictions or a ban.7. in determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practice, in general or individual cases, particular consideration should be given to:(a) the environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ultimate disposal;(b) the substitution by less polluting activities or substances;(c) the scale of use;(d) the potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute materials or activities;(e) advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;(f) time limits for implementation;(g) social and economic implications.8. it therefore follows that best environmental practice for a particular source will change with time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.9. if the reduction of inputs resulting from the use of best environmental practice does not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied and best environmental practice redefined.
