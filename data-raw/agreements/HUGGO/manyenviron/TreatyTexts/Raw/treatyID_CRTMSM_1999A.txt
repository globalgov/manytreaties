conservation of migratory species of wild fauna and the on the conservation of european wildlife and habitats,- the international convention for the regulation of whaling and the agreement for the conservation of cetaceans of the mediterranean and black seas and contiguous atlantic areas,- the convention for the protection of the marine environment and the coastal region of the mediterranean, and its relative protocols,wishing to take action for the conservation of mediterranean marine mammals,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1with respect to the present agreement:a) conservation status is deemed to be "favourable" when the knowledge on the populations indicate that the marine mammal species of the region are maintaining themselves as a viable component of their ecosystem.b) the term "habitat" means any part of the range area of marine mammals, temporarily or permanently occupied by them, and utilized in particular for reproductive, birthing or feeding activities as well as a migration route.c) the term "taking" means the hunting, the capturing, the killing and the harassment of marine mammals including the attempt to conduct such activities ARTICLE 21. the parties establish a marine sanctuary within the area of the mediterranean sea as defined in article 3, whose biological diversity and richness represent an indispensable attribute for the protection of marine

status of marine mammals, by protecting both them and their habitat, from any negative direct or indirect impacts resulting from human activities ARTICLE 5the parties shall cooperate with the intent of periodically assessing marine mammal population status, the causes of mortality and the threats to their habitat and in particular on their biological functions such as feeding and reproductive activities ARTICLE 61. taking into account their international obligations, the parties shall conduct monitoring activities within the sanctuary and shall intensify the fight against any form of pollution, whether of maritime or land-based origin having or likely to have a direct or indirect impact on the conservation status of marine mammals.2. the parties will adopt national strategies aimed at phasing out the release of toxic compounds within the sanctuary, giving priority to substances listed in annex i of the protocol against pollution from land based sources and activities of the barcelona convention for the protection of the mediterranean sea against pollution ARTICLE 7within the sanctuary the parties:a) shall prohibit any deliberate take or intentional disturbance of marine mammals; nevertheless the non-lethal take of individuals shall be authorized in case of emergency situations or within the scope of scientific activities carried out "in situ" and in compliance with the terms of this agreement,b) shall comply with international regulations and those of the european community, regarding the use and the keeping of fishing equipment known as "pelagic drift net",c) shall exchange views, as deemed necessary, to promote in the appropriate fora and after scientific evaluation, the adoption of regulations relating to the use of new fishing equipment that could result in the indirect capture of marine mammals or that could endanger their sources of prey, while also considering the risk of loss of or deliberate disposal of fishing equipment at sea ARTICLE 8in the sanctuary, parties shall regulate the watching of marine mammals for touristic purposes ARTICLE 9the parties shall exchange views with the aim of regulating and if appropriate,

step towards a real and effective protection of mammals in the western mediterranean.without waiting for the ratification procedures, the signatory parties will as from today endeavour to facilitate the application of the agreement by establishing the bases for the management of the sanctuary.the signatory parties may rely on the work already accomplished by themselves at the state and the territorial entities level. in particular, the experience gained within the ramoge agreement will positively contribute to the establishment and management of the sanctuary.the parties hope that, besides the rapid fulfilment of the undertakings embodied in the agreement by the competent authorities of the state and territorial entities, studies on a certain number of points that may complete the substance of the agreement be conducted, applying the precautionary principle. this refers in particular to the consequences on marine mammals of the use of means for seismic and acoustic prospection and detection, as well as the possible exploitation of non-living natural resources. lastly, the question of noise and speed of vessels, already addressed in the agreement with regard to high-speed motorboat races, will need to be also examined.
