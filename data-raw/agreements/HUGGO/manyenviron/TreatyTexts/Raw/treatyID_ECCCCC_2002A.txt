agreement establishing the caribbean community climate change centre (ccccc)source: the contracting parties:recalling that the united nations conference on environment and development held in rio, brazil in 1992 called for "periodic regional and global meetings on sustainable development of small island developing states ...";recalling further that the united nations conference on small island developing states (sids) which was convened in bridgetown, barbados in 1994 concluded that small island developing states (sids) have very specific environmental and developmental needs due to their ecological fragility and vulnerability as well as their peculiar constraints in attempting to achieve sustainable development, in particular, limited availability of human resources and inadequate financial resources for developing and strengthening institutions and their mechanisms;acknowledging that the constraints on sustainable development of sids are also peculiar to other developing countries in the caribbean region, in particular the least developed among them;recognising that the most serious environmental challenge confronting caribbean sids and low-lying developing coastal states in the caribbean region is that of global climate change;recognising further that the adverse effects in the caribbean region of global climate change are likely to be aggravated by the studied response to globalisation / liberalisation as evidenced in aggressive coastal zone development, point source pollution and over-fishing, resulting in the destruction of ecologically fragile and valuable marine eco-systems.concerned that human activities in developed countries substantially increase anthropogenic gaseous emissions which augment atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases thereby increasing the earth's surface and atmospheric temperature with negative impact on human kind and natural eco-systems;convinced that the global nature of climatic change requires the widest co-operation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities, respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions;noting the provisions of united nations general assembly resolutions 43/53 of 6 december 1988; 44/207 of 22 december 1989; 45/212 of 21 december 1990, and 46/169 of 19 december 1991 on the protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind;noting also the provisions of united nations general assembly resolution 44/206 of 22 december 1989 on the possible adverse effects of sea-level rise on developing islands and coastal areas, particularly low-lying coastal areas;noting further the vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer, 1985 and the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, 1987, as amended on 29 june 1990;believing that small island developing states and such others with low-lying coastal areas susceptible to floods or with fragile mountainous eco-systems are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of global climate change;believing also that steps required to understand and respond effectively to the negative effects of global climate change must be based on relevant scientific, technical and economic considerations and continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in these areas;affirming that responses to climate change should be co-ordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impact on the latter, taking fully into account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty;determined to contribute positively to the protection of the climate system for present and future generations;recalling also that the conference of heads of government of the caribbean community at its twenty-first meeting held in canouan, st. vincent and the grenadines on 2-5 july 2000, agreed to support the initiatives towards the establishment of a regional climate change centre;convinced also that the project entitled caribbean planning for adaptation to global climate change (cpacc) has made a significant contribution in sensitising states of the caribbean region of the importance of adjusting to the negative consequences of climate change,have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1 use of termsin this agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:"adverse/negative effects of climate
