experience from and facilitate the use of joint implementation (ji) under article 6 and emissions trading (et) under article 17 of the kyoto protocol and to implement projects generating emission reductions prior to and during the commitment period commencing in 2008, in order to reduce anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases cost-effectively ARTICLE 3objectives of testing ground cooperationfor the purposes of this agreement, the objectives of testing ground cooperation are:a) to build capacity and competence to use the kyoto mechanisms and promote common understanding of concepts, rules and guidelines for use of the flexible mechanisms of the kyoto protocol, to promote realisation of high quality projects in the energy sector generating emissions reductions;b) to gain experience with the joint implementation (ji) mechanism under the kyoto protocol in the energy sector, especially with projects in the fields of energy saving, energy efficiency, fuel switching in combination with energy efficiency or saving, and renewable energy sources;c) to develop methods and procedures in conformity with the rules and guidelines of the kyoto protocol with a view to ensuring the environmental integrity of projects;d) to collaborate in addressing administrative and financial barriers and the level of transaction costs, especially regarding small-scale ji projects;e) to facilitate generation, ensure issuance and transfer of erus and aaus related to or accruing from ji projects and emissions trading andf) to implement projects early and offer credit for emission reductions prior to 2008 ARTICLE 4participationparticipation in the activities on the testing ground for the baltic sea region is open to public and private legal entities in baltic sea region states that are parties to this agreement ARTICLE 5project implementationthe parties encourage business, industries, energy utilities, financial institutions, regional and local authorities to take an active role in identification and implementation of joint implementation projects within the framework of the testing ground. such projects are to be carried out in the baltic sea region.in order to foster and contribute to the implementation of ji projects and to fulfil the objectives of this agreement, a testing ground facility (tgf) is being established. the testing ground facility will serve as a multilateral financing instrument for ji projects under this agreement ARTICLE 6criteria, approval and registration of projectsall projects implemented under this agreement shall be carried out in the baltic sea region and shall be approved by the investor party and host party in accordance with the kyoto protocol and the relevant rules, decisions and guidelines thereunder. a written approval shall be issued either by the testing ground facility and the host party or by the investor party/parties and the host party. before a written approval is issued, project owners shall demonstrate how the proposed project will contribute to the objectives of the testing ground.the co-operation within the testing ground shall focus on energy-related climate change mitigation projects especially in the fields of energy saving, energy efficiency, fuel switching in combination with energy efficiency or saving and renewable energy sources.the testing ground shall also be open to the projects implemented by legal entities in parties without financing through the tgf, under the precondition that they are compatible with this agreement and contribute to the objectives of this agreement by participating in capacity building and exchange of information. after the written approval has been issued, participating projects shall be registered with the testing ground committee to be established under article 11 of this agreement.it is recommended that all the projects to be implemented under this agreement to the extent appropriate follow the guidance given in the basrec regional handbook on procedures for joint implementation in the baltic sea region developed for the testing ground of the baltic sea region ARTICLE 7project validation and verificationemission reductions generated by the projects shall be subject to verification in accordance with the kyoto protocol and the relevant rules, decisions and guidelines hereunder. the verification process entails

under the kyoto protocol either by an independent entity under the testing ground committee or by the host party. emission reductions generated by the projects prior to the first commitment period under the kyoto protocol shall be verified by an independent entity. verification by a host party may be conducted during the first commitment period of the kyoto protocol and thereafter provided that the host party meets the eligibility requirements under the kyoto protocol and the relevant rules, decisions and guidelines thereunder.whenever the host party is entitled to verify the emission reductions, the investor party/parties may still require that emission reductions are verified by an independent entity.the parties to this agreement shall undertake the necessary steps for issuance of erus and aaus corresponding to the verified amount of emissions reductions ARTICLE 8transfer of creditsthe parties shall ensure the timely transfer of erus and aaus accruing from the projects from

agreed/indicated by the project participants ARTICLE 9capacity buildingthe parties agree to work together to build capacity and competence regarding the kyoto mechanisms in the public and private sectors to facilitate co-operation in this field, i.e. through arranging workshops, seminars and conferences. the basrec regional handbook on procedures for joint implementation in the baltic sea region has been developed as a contribution to common understanding of ji concepts, the ji project cycle and to capacity building ARTICLE 10sharing experiencethe parties are encouraged to share information and experience of ji activities. such information should include information relating to the ji project cycle, credit issuance and transfer of credits. exchange of views and experiences on
