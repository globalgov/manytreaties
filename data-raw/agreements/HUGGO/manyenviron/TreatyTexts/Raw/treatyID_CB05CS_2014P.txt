duly authorized, have signed this protocol.done at the city of ashgabat on the thirtieth day of may of 2014 ANNEX icategories for the identification of threatened speciesextinct (ex)a taxon is extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. a taxon is presumed extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.extinct in the wild (ew)a taxon is extinct in the wild when it is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population (or populations) well outside the past range. a taxon is presumed extinct in the wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.critically endangered (cr)a taxon is critically endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria a to e* for critically endangered, and it is therefore considered to be facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.endangered (en)a taxon is endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria a to e* for endangered and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.vulnerable (vu)a taxon is vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria a to e* for vulnerable, and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.near threatened (nt)a taxon is near threatened when it has been evaluated against the criteria* but does not qualify for critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable now, but is close to qualifying for or is likely to qualify for a threatened category in the near future.least concern (lc)a taxon is least concern when it has been evaluated against the criteria* and does not qualify for critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near threatened. widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category.data deficient (dd)a taxon is data deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. a taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. data deficient is therefore not a category of threat. listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that threatened classification is appropriate. it is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. in many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between dd and a threatened status. if the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed, and a considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.not evaluated (ne)a taxon is not evaluated when it is has not yet been evaluated against the criteria.* the criteria can be found in the "iucn red list and criteria" (latest version 3.1) ANNEX iicommon criteria for inclusion in the pacs lista. site selection criteria1. to be eligible for inclusion in the pacs list, an area must comply with at least one of the subparagraphs set out in article 9, paragraph 1 of this protocol. several of these sub-paragraphs can be complied with by the same area in certain cases, and such circumstances only strengthen the case for the inclusion of the area in the list.2. no limit is imposed on the total number of areas included in the list or on the number of areas any individual party can propose for inscription. nevertheless, the parties agree that sites will be selected on a scientific basis and included in the list according to their qualities; therefore they will have to fulfil the requirements set out by this protocol and the present criteria.3. the contracting parties agree that besides the fundamental criteria of national administrative status of protected areas, the following criteria will guide their site selection for inclusion in the pacs list:(a) global significance:the site is a particularly good example of a natural or near-natural ecosystem, characteristics of the appropriate bio-geographical region; it supports an appreciable assemblage of rare, vulnerable or endangered species or subspecies of plant or animal, or an appreciable number of individuals of any one or more of these species; it is of special value for maintaining the genetic and ecological diversity of a region because of the quality and peculiarities of its flora and fauna; it is of special value as the habitat of plants or animals at a critical stage of their biological cycle; it regularly supports 20,000 waterfowl; it regularly supports 1% of the population of one species or subspecies of waterfowl;(b) regional value:the site has a regional value and highly representative of the caspian region and its biological diversity;(c) national status:the site has the administrative status of national protected area, protection measures and a financed management plan;(d) uniqueness:the site contains unique or rare ecosystems, and or rare; threatened; endangered or endemic species;(e) natural representativeness:the site is highly representative of ecological systems, community or habitat types or other natural characteristics;(f) biological diversity:the site has a high diversity of species, communities, habitats or ecosystems;(g) manageable anthropogenic stressors:sites with less human-induced stressors are preferred;(h) manageable natural stressors:sites with minimum degree of natural stressors are preferred;(i) availability of adequate baseline data:the site has a minimal information gap and some degree of reliable baseline data available;(j) cultural representativeness:the site has high representative value with respect to cultural heritage, due to the existence of environmentally sound traditional activities integrated with nature, which support the well being of local populations;(k) scientific, educational and aesthetic values:the site has scientific, educational or aesthetic value and does not face threats likely to immediately impair its ecological, biological, aesthetic or cultural values;(l) civil society involvement:there is an ongoing involvement and active participation of the public, particularly of local communities, in the process of planning and management of the area.b. criteria for inclusion in the pacs listto be included in the pacs list, the contracting parties agree to undertake the following planning and management measures within their proposed areas:(a) submission of relevant baseline data including environmental, socio- economic and cultural aspects and a plan of fulfilling the identified information gaps;(b) submission of a well defined short and long-term objectives of the conservation management plan;(c) submission of relevant information on the competent authority/authorities and status of multiple stakeholder involvement;(d) application of measures including environmental impact assessment, to prevent, control and mitigate all sources of pollution that might have adverse impact on the conservation status of species, community, ecosystem or habitats, cultural, or aesthetic value of the area proposed for inclusion in the pacs list;(e) fully cooperate in implementation of provisions of this protocol, especially in connection with the introduction and or re-introduction of any species;(f) to be included in the pacs list an area will have to be endowed with a management plan. the main rules of this management plan are to be defined from the time of inclusion and implemented immediately. a detailed management plan must be presented within three years of the time of inclusion. failure to respect this obligation entails the removal of the site from the list;(g) the competence and responsibility with regard to administration and implementation of conservation measures for areas proposed for inclusion in the pacs list must be clearly defined in the texts governing each area;(h) in order to be included in the pacs list, a protected area must have a management body with sufficient powers as well as the means and human resources to prevent and/or control activities which are likely to be contrary to the aims of the protected area;(i) to be included in the pacs list, an area will have to be endowed with a monitoring programme. this programme should include the identification and monitoring of a certain number of significant parameters for the area in question, in order to allow the assessment of the condition and evolution of the area, as well as the effectiveness of protection and management measures implemented, so that they may be adapted if need be. submission of regular monitoring reports of the area from the date of inclusion in the pacs list.c. implementation of protection, planning and management measures1. conservation and management objectives must be clearly defined in the text relating to each site, and will constitute the basis for assessment of the adequacy of the adopted measures and the effectiveness of their implementation during the revisions of the pacs list.2. protection, planning and management measures applicable to each area must be adequate for the achievement of the conservation and management objectives set forth in the management plan for the site in the short and long term, and take in particular into account the threats upon it.3. protection, planning and management measures must be based on an adequate knowledge of the elements of the natural environment and of socio-economic and cultural factors that characterize each area. in case of shortcomings in basic knowledge, an area accepted for inclusion in the pacs list must actively initiate the collection of the missing data and information.4. in the respect of the specificity characterizing each protected site, the protection measures for a pacs must take account of the following basic aspects:(a) the strengthening of the regulation pertaining to the release or dumping of wastes and other substances likely directly or indirectly to impair the integrity of the area;(b) the strengthening of the regulation of the introduction or reintroduction of any species into the area;(c) the regulation of any activity or act likely to harm or disturb the species, or that might endanger the conservation status of the ecosystems or species or might impair the natural, cultural or aesthetic characteristics of the area;(d) the regulation applicable to the zones surrounding the area in question.5. periodic reporting of the monitoring and evaluation of the site, and appropriate revisions of the management plan should be undertaken in accordance with this protocol.6. failure to meet these criteria will result in the removal from the pacs list.
