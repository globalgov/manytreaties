convention on the continental shelfsource: the states parties to this conventionhave agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1for the purpose of these articles, the term "continental shelf" is used as referring(a) to the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said area;(b) to the seabed and subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of islands ARTICLE 21. the coastal state exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.2. the rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are exclusive in the sense that if the coastal state does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities, or make a claim to the continental shelf, without the express consent of the coastal state.3. the rights of the coastal state over the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, effective or notional, or on any express proclamation.4. the natural resources referred to in these articles consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the sea-bed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species that is to say, organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil ARTICLE 3the rights of the coastal state over the continental shelf do not affect the legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas, or that of the airspace above those waters ARTICLE 4subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources, the coastal state may not impede the laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipe lines on the continental shelf ARTICLE 51. the exploration of the continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources must not result in any unjustifiable interference with navigation, fishing or the conservation of the living resources of the sea, nor result in any interference with fundamental oceanographic or other scientific research carried out with the intention of open publication.2. subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 6 of this article, the coastal state is entitled to construct and maintain or operate on the continental shelf installations and other devices necessary for its exploration and the exploitation of its natural resources, and to establish safety zones around such installations and devices and to take in those zones measures necessary for their protection.3. the safety zones referred to in paragraph 2 of this article may extend to a distance of 500 metres around the installations and other devices which have been erected, measured from each point of their outer edge. ships of all nationalities must respect these safety zones.4. such installations and devices, though under the jurisdiction of the coastal state, do not possess the status of islands. they have no territorial sea of their own, and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea of the coastal state.5. due notice must be given of the construction of any such installations, and permanent means for giving warning of their presence must be maintained. any installations which are abandoned or disused must be entirely removed.6. neither the installations or devices, nor the safety zones around them, may be established where interference may be caused to the use of recognized sea lanes essential to international navigation.7. the coastal state is obliged to undertake, in the safety zones, all appropriate measures for the protection of the living resources of the sea from harmful agents.8. the consent of the coastal state shall be obtained in respect of any research concerning the continental shelf and undertaken there. nevertheless, the coastal state shall not normally withhold its consent if the request is submitted by a qualified institution with a view to purely scientific research into the physical or biological characteristics of the continental shelf, subject to the proviso that the coastal state shall have the right, if it so desires, to participate or to be represented in the research, and that in any event the results shall be published ARTICLE 61. where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two or more states whose coasts are opposite each other, the boundary of the continental shelf appertaining to such states shall be determined by agreement between them. in the absence of agreement, and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances, the boundary is the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each state is measured.2. where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two adjacent states, the boundary of the continental shelf shall be determined by agreement between them. in the absence of agreement, and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances, the boundary shall be determined by application of the principle of equidistance from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each state is measured.3. in delimiting the boundaries of the continental shelf, any lines which are drawn in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article should be defined with reference to charts and geographical features as they exist at a particular date, and reference should be made to fixed permanent identifiable points on the land ARTICLE 7the provisions of these articles shall not prejudice the right of the coastal state to exploit the subsoil by means of tunnelling irrespective of the depth of water above the subsoil ARTICLE 8this convention shall, until 31 october 1958, be open for signature by all states members of the united nations or of any of the specialized agencies, and by any other state invited by the general assembly of the united nations to become a party to the convention ARTICLE 9this convention is subject to ratification. the instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the secretary-general of the united nations ARTICLE 10this convention shall be open for accession by any states belonging to any of the categories mentioned in article 8. the instruments of accession shall be deposited with the secretary-general of the united nations ARTICLE 111. this convention shall come into force on the thirtieth day following the date of deposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification or accession with the secretary-general of the united nations.2. for each state ratifying or acceding to the convention after the deposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification or accession, the convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after deposit by such state of its instrument of ratification or accession ARTICLE 121. at the time of signature, ratification or accession, any state may make reservations to articles of the convention other than to articles 1 to 3 inclusive.2. any contracting state making a reservation in accordance with the preceding paragraph may at any time withdraw the reservation by a communication to that effect addressed to the secretary-general of the united nations ARTICLE 131. after the expiration of a period of five years from the date on which this convention shall enter into force, a request for the revision of this convention may be made at any time by any contracting party by means of a notification in writing addressed to the secretary-general of the united nations.2. the general assembly of the united nations shall decide upon the steps, if any, to be taken in respect of such request ARTICLE 14the secretary-general of the united nations shall inform all states members of the united nations and the other states referred to in article 8:(a) of signatures to this convention and of the deposit of instruments of ratification or accession, in accordance with articles 8,
