agreement creating the eastern pacific tuna fishing organizationsource: the contracting parties:recognizing that coastal states have sovereign rights over all fishing resources, including species denominated as highly migratory, in the seas adjacent to and within 200 miles of their coastlines, for the benefit of their peoples and mainly for exploration and proper exploitation, conservation and management purposes;aware that the conservation, protection and optimum utilization of highly migratory species should be the fundamental objective of any regional agreement on this matter;believing that the purpose of optimum utilization of highly migratory species is to ensure that the maximum sustainable yield be produced by rational exploitation of same;aware that the eastern pacific coastal states have different degrees of tuna fishing development at different technical levels, and that it is therefore necessary to promote international cooperation leading to a strengthening of national capacities and the transfer of technology to countries requiring same in order to achieve harmonious development within the region;recognizing that, in order to achieve these ends, it is necessary to establish a system of international cooperation in research, conservation, protection and optimum utilization of the tuna fish in the eastern pacific ocean, under an international agreement;bearing in mind that the tuna species are highly migratory and cover a wide haunt in the eastern pacific ocean and that, as a result, in order to ensure their conservation and to control their exploitation it is necessary to create a regional organization which, for this purpose and based on the sovereign rights of maritime states, shall comprise an integrated body of all members, empowered to take decisions by consensus;convinced that the international agreement's area of application should of necessity be that of the haunts of the highly migratory species found in the eastern pacific;emphasizing the joint purpose of the latin american fisheries development organization - oldepesca, and of the permanent commission for the south pacific - cpps, to achieve promptly a valid international agreement guaranteeing conservation, protection and optimum utilization of tuna in the eastern pacific;recognizing that the present agreement does not prejudge nor affect the position maintained by the states parties hereto regarding matters arising from the law of the seas;bearing in mind the principles and norms of ocean rights relating to the management and conservation of live resources, including highly migratory species;based on the fourteen (14) fundamental principles approved by the working group on regional coordination for benefitting fully from tuna resources, at its first extraordinary meeting held in mexico city in february 1964, and which form an integral part of the present agreement, the text of which in attached (1);have agreed the following: ARTICLE 1 the organization's name,

season.2. the fishing access records mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall not be applicable to domestic vessels fishing exclusively in the seas adjacent to and within 200 miles of their own coastal state ARTICLE 18 fixing fishing season dates1. the scientific committee, following the governing board's guidelines, shall establish the opening and closing of the fishing season for the agreement's total area of application, in order that the maximum permissible total catch be respected for species which require said methods of conservation.should an eastern pacific coastal member state, based on its scientific evidence, believe that the closing date established by the scientific committee should be modified, the executive secretary shall convene the governing board immediately in order to hold the corresponding extraordinary meeting.the executive secretary shall notify member states of the opening and closing dates of each fishing season.2. in accordance with the terms of the previous point, when fixing the opening and closing dates for each season, priority consideration shall be given to ensure that each coastal member state has sufficient time to fish in the seas adjacent to and within 200 miles of its coastline.following shall be the effects of closing the fishing season.a. on the closing date the fleets of non-coastal states parties shall cease to fish in

territorial waters, including species denominated as highly migratory, for the primary benefit of their peoples and in order that rational exploitation be developed in order to ensure their conservation.2. the conservation, protection and optimum utilization of the resources should be the fundamental objective of a regional agreement on tuna matters.3. for the effects of the agreement, optimum utilization is understood to mean the rational exploitation of resources in order to ensure the maximum sustainable yield.4. tuna fish are migratory species deploying a wide area of the eastern pacific ocean and therefore, in order to ensure their conservation and control the exploitation thereof, it is necessary to promote the creation of a regional organization to this effect, which same shall have a board to adopt decisions by consensus.5. the regional organization shall have the necessary mechanisms to obtain and, exchange between its members the scientific data required to comply with its objectives, especially for conserving the resources.6. the agreement's area of application shall be that deployed in the eastern pacific by the controlled species, within the territorial waters of member states, as well as in the high seas area adjacent thereto.7. the highly migratory species covered by the agreement shall be primarily those where, based on the best available scientific data, the volume of fish makes necessary their urgent conservation.8. parties to this agreement may be all eastern pacific coastal states, and those states that have been fishing these species in the region. the board shall decide on the admission of other members through their adherence to the agreement, respecting the principles of saturation fishing when this in applicable.9. in application of the coastal states' sovereign rights over the mentioned resources, same may grant access licences or permits for fishing the surplus volumes of these species in their territorial waters, according to a regional conservation system.10. coastal states shall communicate to the respective regional body the surplus fish that they make available to other states. the regional organization, to be created by the respective agreement, shall grant fishing permits or access licences for the utilization of these resources in international waters.11. the need to ensure conservation, in order to determine the permissible global catch in the area in question, according to the best available scientific information. the overall quota shall incorporate the respective national quotas according to the concentrations of resources in each zone.12. with the constant objective of guarantying the conservation of the species, the coastal states shall report on the volume of fishing carried out in their territorial waters, and through their respective plans will gather information on catches in international waters.13. any agreed upon system must include firm provisions for fiscal supervision and control.14. the referred to agreement shall pay due attention to the need to promote development of the fishing capacity of those coastal states that have still not been able to catch the existing concentrations of resources in their waters, bearing in mind the needs of disadvantaged vessels.attachment [2]species c0vered by the present agreementyellowfin tuna
