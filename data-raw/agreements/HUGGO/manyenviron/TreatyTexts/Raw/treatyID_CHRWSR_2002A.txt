an aim of:- to fix the principles and the methods of the distribution of water of the senegal river enters the various sectors of use. the various uses of water of the river can relate to agriculture, the breeding, continental fishing, pisciculture, sylviculture, fauna and the flora, hydroelectric energy, the water supply of the urban and rural populations, health, industry, navigation and the environment, by taking account of the domestic uses;- to define the methods of examination and approval of the new users projects of water or affecting the quality of water;- to determine the rules relating to the safeguarding and the environmental protection, particularly with regard to fauna, the flora, the ecosystems of the easily flooded plains and the wetlands;- to define the framework and the methods of participation of the users of water in the catch of the decisions of stock management out of water of the senegal river ARTICLE 3the present charter applies to the whole of the catchment area of the senegal river including the affluents, the distributaries and the associated depressions ARTICLE 3principles and methods for the distribution of water between the various sectors of use ARTICLE 4the use of water of the river is opened in each coastal state, like with the people being on her territory in accordance with the principles and methods defined by the present charter.the distribution of water between the uses is in particular founded on the following general principles:- obligation to guarantee the balanced management of the water resource;- the equitable and reasonable use of water of the river;- obligation to preserve the environment;- obligation to negotiate in the event of conflict;- obligation for each coastal state to inform the other coastal states before undertaking any action or any project which could have an impact on the availability of water and/or the possibility of implementing future projects.the guiding principles of any distribution of water of the river aim at ensuring the populations of the coastal states, the full pleasure of the resource, in the respect of the safety of the people and the works, as well as basic human rights to a salubrious water, from the point of view of a durable development ARTICLE 5any distribution of water between the uses is fixed by taking in consideration the availability of the resource and integrating the following elements:1) the sous-regionale co-operation, which takes into account:- the safety and improvement of the incomes of the populations of the basin of the senegal river;- the fight counters the rural migration;- food safety and the fight for the reduction of poverty;- reinforcement of the economies of the coastal states compared to the climatic changes;- the quantitative and qualitative development of the production agricultural, energy, mining and industrial;- the development integrated thanks to the infrastructures carried out.2) the integrated management of the resource, which takes into account:- the availability and the continuity of the resource;- the integration of the dimension of the environment in the management of water and the durable maintenance of the favorable ecological conditions in the basin of the river;- the irrigation of a maximum quantity of surfaces according to the availability of the resource;- permanent navigability of the river;- optimal exploitation of the hydroelectric potential energy available;- the creation of the hydraulic conditions necessary to the flood of the valley and the traditional cultures of fall;- the rolling of the exceptional natural risings with manantali, and the reduction of the risks of flood;- improvement of the filling of the lakes guiers and the r' kiz, as well as natural depressions;- reasonable character of the requests by economic sector and their implications ARTICLE 6the technical principles aimed to article 7 are secondary compared to the principle of nondiscrimination, the obligation to satisfy the vital needs and with safety for the people.they are appreciated according to three different contexts:- the normal situation corresponding to the situation where the reasonable satisfaction of all the needs is possible;- the situation corresponding to the floods or natural disasters;- the situation of shortage corresponding to one period of general or partial insufficiency, or to a case of absolute necessity.in these the last two cases, the standing committee of water is seized. however, if a state is brought to take emergency measures in a unilateral way, it will hold immediately informed the other states of them ARTICLE 7the principles used in the distribution of water, such as defined in the appendices, take account of the following essential elements:- storage capacity;- the division of information on water flows of the river for the taking into account of the constraints of use;- the safety of the works;- water supply (urban, and rural);- the safeguarding and environmental protection;- the support for agriculture (of fall, irrigated), for the livestock and continental fishing;- hydroelectric production;- the freedom of navigation.the economic principles used in the distribution of water, take account of the following essential aspects:- reassignment of the revenues from taxes resulting from the tax on the users responsible for pollution to the financing for ecological management for the resource;- the taking into account of the financial contribution of each use to the financing of the investments, the recurring loads and to the refunding of the contracted debts ARTICLE 8the use of the water resource aims at satisfying in a way right:- requirements out of drinking water for the populations, in particular most vulnerable;- needs for agriculture, the breeding, sylviculture, pisciculture, fishing, fauna, the flora and the environment;- requirements out of water for the energy production;- requirements out of water for industry;- requirements out of water for navigation ARTICLE 9the organization, according to the requests of the users, fixes the priorities between the needs, as well as the water consumption necessary. no use profits from a priority compared to the others in accordance with the principles of the international law.however, in the event of shortage of the resource, a detailed attention will be given to the supply drinking water and the domestic uses of water ARTICLE 10except the domestic uses which are free, the collecting of water of the river is subjected to a preliminary declaration or authorization arrangement.the operations subjected to the authorization arrangement are:- the construction or the operation of the installations or the works;- the realization of work or various activities (taking away, discharges or rejections), likely to present dangers to health or public safety, to harm the free water run-off, to reduce the water resource, to affect the bed of the river, or to attack the quality or to the biodiversity of the aquatic environment.the other operations are subjected to simple declaration. the authorities exerting the powers of police force and administration of water within each state have the obligation to transmit the declarations to the high commissionership.a nomenclature of the thresholds of authorization and declaration will be worked out and implemented in accordance with the provisions of this charter. on the quantitative level, the thresholds of authorization or declaration of the operations are a function of the flow taken compared to the minimum flow.on the qualitative level, they take account of the brittleness of the zones of taking away or rejection.this nomenclature is elaborate by taking

prospective evaluation of the quantity of water and the quality of the water of the catchment area of the river.in complement with the general rules enacted above, the contracting states will be able to adopt other provisions together determining in particular the conditions under which the rules of police force of water are applicable to divided water.with regard to subsoil waters, it is carried out a cartographic census of the aquiferous zones of refill, in order to inventory them, to delimit the zones of food and collecting, and to know the interactions between surface water and subsoil waters ARTICLE 18the taxes instituted by the states against the users pollutants of the environment are assigned to the financing of the ecologically rational management of the resource.the states begin to set up tax incentives intended to help the economic operators who practise respectful methods of use of the resource of the environment.the states will take care that the principle
