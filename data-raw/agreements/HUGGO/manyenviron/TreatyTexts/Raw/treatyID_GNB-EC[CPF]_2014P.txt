After completion of the technical inspection, Guinea-Bissau shall issue a certificate of compliance to the master of the vessel immediately, and send a copy to the EU.

11.5.

The certificate of compliance shall be valid for a period of one year. However, any change of fishing to or from the shrimp fishing category shall require a new certification of compliance. Furthermore, a new certificate of compliance shall be required if the vessel leaves the Guinea-Bissau exclusive economic zone for a period greater than 45 days.

11.6.

The certificate of compliance must be kept on board at all times.

11.7.

The costs of the technical inspection shall be borne by the vessel owner and shall be the amount determined by the rates set out by Guinea-Bissau law. These costs may not exceed the amounts paid for the same service by national vessels or vessels flying the flag of a third State.

  In the case of transhipment, the master must ensure that the receiving vessel has an authorisation issued by the authorities competent for such an operation.
  
  3.
  
  The transhipment operation must be carried out within a Guinea-Bissau port. Transhipment at sea is prohibited.
  
  4.
  
  Non-compliance with these provisions shall lead to the application of the relevant penalties provided for under Guinea-Bissau's legislation.

CHAPTER VI

Satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS)

1.   Vessel position messages - VMS system

1.1.

While they are in the Guinea-Bissau zone, EU vessels holding a fishing authorisation must be equipped with a satellite monitoring system (Vessel Monitoring System - VMS) to enable automatic and continuous communication of their position, at all times, to the fisheries monitoring centre (FMC) of their flag State.

1.2.

Each position message must

(i)

include:

(a)

the vessel identification

(b)

the most recent geographical position of the vessel (longitude, latitude), with a position error of less than 500 metres, and with a confidence interval of 99 %

(c)

the date and time the position is recorded

(d)

the speed and the course of the vessel

(ii)

be configured in accordance with the format set out in the Appendix.

1.3.

The position recorded after entry into the Guinea-Bissau zone shall be identified by the code 'ENT'. All subsequent positions shall be identified by the code 'POS', with the exception of the first position recorded after departure from the Guinea-Bissau zone, which shall be identified by the code 'EXI'.

1.4.

The FMC of the flag State shall ensure the automatic processing and, if necessary, the electronic transmission of the position messages. The position messages shall be recorded in a secure manner and kept for a period of three years.

2.   Transmission by the vessel in the event of breakdown of the VMS system

2.1.

The master shall ensure at all times that the VMS system of his vessel is fully operational and that the position messages are correctly transmitted to the FMC of the flag State.

2.2.

In the event of breakdown, the VMS system of the vessel shall be repaired or replaced within one month. If it is not repaired within that time, the vessel shall no longer be authorised to fish in the Guinea-Bissau zone.

2.3.

Vessels fishing in the Guinea-Bissau zone with a defective VMS system must communicate their position messages by e-mail, radio or fax to the FMC of the flag State, at least every four hours, and must provide all the information stipulated in paragraph 1.2.

3.   Secure communication of position messages to the Guinea-Bissau FMC

3.1.

As soon as Guinea-Bissau has established an operational FMC, the FMC of the flag State shall automatically send the position messages of the relevant vessels to the Guinea-Bissau FMC. The FMC of the flag State and the FMC of Guinea-Bissau shall exchange their contact e-mail addresses and inform each other immediately of any change to these addresses.

3.2.

The transmission of position messages between the FMCs of the flag State and Guinea-Bissau shall be carried out electronically using a secure communication system.

3.3.

The FMC of Guinea-Bissau and the FMC of the flag State shall inform each other immediately of any interruption in the receiving of consecutive position messages from a vessel holding a fishing authorisation, where the vessel concerned has not notified its departure from the zone.

4.   Malfunction of the communication system

4.1.

Guinea-Bissau shall ensure the compatibility of its electronic equipment with that of the FMC of the flag State and inform the EU immediately of any malfunction as regards the communication and receiving of position messages with a view to finding a technical solution as soon as possible. The Joint Committee shall deal with any possible dispute arising.

4.2.

The master shall be considered to be responsible for any proven manipulation of a vessel's VMS system aimed at disturbing its operation or falsifying its position messages. Any infringement shall be subject to the penalties provided for by the Guinea-Bissau legislation in force.
  
  5.   Revision of the frequency of position messages
  
  5.1.
  
  On the basis of documentary evidence proving an infringement, Guinea-Bissau may ask the FMC of the flag State, copying in the EU, to reduce the interval for sending position messages from a vessel to every thirty minutes for a set period of investigation. This documentary evidence must be sent by Guinea-Bissau to the FMC of the flag State and to the EU. The FMC of the flag State shall immediately send the position messages to Guinea-Bissau at the reduced frequency. The FMC of Guinea-Bissau shall immediately notify the FMC of the flag State and the EU of the end of the investigation procedure.
  
  5.2.
  
  At the end of the investigation period, Guinea-Bissau shall inform the FMC of the flag State and the EU of any monitoring which is required.
  
  CHAPTER VII
  
  Check
  
  1.   Entering and leaving the zone
  
  1.1.
  
  Any entry into or departure from the Guinea-Bissau fishing zone by an EU vessel holding a fishing authorisation must be notified to Guinea-Bissau within 24 hours of the entry or departure. This period is reduced to 6 hours for tuna-fishing vessels and surface longliners.
  
  1.2.
  
  When notifying its entry or departure, the vessel shall notify in particular:
    
    (i)
  
  the date, time and point of passage scheduled
  
  (ii)
  
  the quantity of each species held on board, as identified by its FAO alpha 3 code and expressed in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish
  
  (iii)
  
  the product presentation.
  
  1.3.
  
  Notification shall be given preferably by e-mail or, failing that, by fax or radio, to an e-mail address, a telephone number or a frequency communicated by Guinea-Bissau. Guinea-Bissau shall immediately inform the vessels concerned and the EU of any change to the e-mail addresses, telephone number or transmission frequency.
  
  1.4.
  
  Any vessel found to be fishing in the Guinea-Bissau fishing zone without having previously notified its presence shall be considered to be an unauthorised fishing vessel.
  
  2.   Inspections
  
  2.1.
  
  Masters of EU fishing vessels engaged in fishing activities in Guinea-Bissau waters shall allow and facilitate boarding and the discharge of their duties by any authorised Guinea-Bissau official responsible for the inspection of fishing activities.
  
  2.2.
  
  These officials shall not remain on board for longer than is necessary for the discharge of their duties.
  
  2.3.
  
  Once the inspection has been completed, an official control report shall be issued to the master of the vessel.
  
  CHAPTER VIII
  
  Infringements
  
  1.   Treatment of infringements
  
  1.1.
  
  Any infringement of the provisions of this Annex by an EU vessel holding a fishing authorisation must be referred to in an inspection report.
  
  1.2.
  
  The signature of the inspection report by the master shall be without prejudice to the vessel owner's right of defence in respect of an infringement.

2.   Detention of a vessel - information meeting

2.1.

Where permitted under the national legislation for the reported infringement, any EU vessel having committed an infringement may be forced to cease its fishing activity and, where the vessel is at sea, to return to a Guinea-Bissau port.

2.2.

Guinea-Bissau shall notify the EU within 48 hours of any detention of an EU vessel holding a fishing authorisation. This notification shall be accompanied by documentary evidence of the infringement.

2.3.

Before taking any measure against the vessel, the master, the crew or the cargo, with the exception of measures aimed at protecting evidence, Guinea-Bissau shall organise, at the request of the EU, within one working day of notification of the detention of the vessel, an information meeting to clarify the facts which have led to the vessel being detained and to explain what further action may be taken. A representative of the flag State of the vessel may attend this information meeting.

3.   Penalties for infringements - Compromise procedure

3.1.

The penalty for the infringement shall be set by Guinea-Bissau according to the provisions of the national legislation in force.

3.2.

Where settling the infringement involves legal proceedings, before these are launched, a compromise procedure shall be undertaken between Guinea-Bissau and the EU to determine the terms and level of the penalty. A representative of the flag State of the vessel may participate in this compromise procedure. The compromise procedure shall finish at the latest four days after the notification of the detention of the vessel.

4.   Legal proceedings - Bank security

4.1.

If the compromise procedure fails and the infringement is brought before the competent court, the owner of the vessel which committed the infringement shall deposit a bank security at a bank designated by Guinea-Bissau, the amount of which, as set by Guinea-Bissau, covers the costs linked to the detention of the vessel, the estimated fine and any compensation. The bank security may not be recovered until the legal proceedings have been concluded.

4.2.

The bank security shall be released and returned to the vessel owner immediately after the judgment has been given

(a)

in full, if no penalty has been imposed

(b)

for the amount of the remaining balance, if the penalty is a fine which is lower than the amount of the bank security.

4.3.

Guinea-Bissau shall inform the EU of the outcome of the legal proceedings within eight days of the judgement being given.

5.   Release of the vessel

The vessel and its master shall be authorised to leave the port once the penalty has been paid in a compromise procedure, or once the bank security has been deposited.

An EU vessel that is not equipped with an ERS system, or whose ERS system is not working, is not authorised to begin a fishing operation in Guinea-Bissau waters.
  
  2.
  
  The flag Member State and Guinea-Bissau shall both ensure that their national fisheries monitoring centres (FMC) are equipped with the necessary IT equipment and software for automatically transmitting the ERS data in the XML format available on http://ec.europa.eu/cfp/control/codes/index_en.htm and saving the ERS data for at least 3 years. Any amendment or update of the format must be identified and dated and enter into force after a 6-month period.
  
  3.
  
  The ERS data shall be transmitted using the electronic means of communication operated by the European Commission on behalf of the EU.
  
  4.
  
  The Parties shall ensure that the ERS data are registered sequentially.
  
  5.
  
  The flag Member State and Guinea-Bissau shall ensure that their FMCs exchange the relevant names, e-mail addresses and telephone and fax numbers. Any later changes to this data shall be communicated without delay.
  
  Transmission of ERS data
  
  6.
  
  All EU vessels fishing under this Protocol:
    
    (a)
  
  shall keep an electronic logbook for each day they are in Guinea-Bissau waters. Each species shall be identified by its FAO alpha 3 code, in kilograms of live weight or, if necessary, the number of individual fish;
  
  (b)
  
  shall communicate the quantities held on board for each of the species identified on the fishing authorisation, on each entry into and departure from Guinea-Bissau waters, the provisions of Chapter VII notwithstanding;
  
  (c)
  
  shall record the catches made in Guinea-Bissau waters by species and for each haul, identifying the quantities caught and the discarded catches. For the species identified on the fishing authorisation, the master must also indicate the absence of catches;
  
  (d)
  
  shall record by species the quantities transhipped and/or unloaded, notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter V;
  
  (e)
  
  shall send the ERS data electronically to the FMC of its flag State before 23:59 UTC.
  
  7.
  
  The master shall be responsible for the accuracy of the ERS data recorded and sent.
  
  8.
  
  The flag State shall ensure that its FMC sends the ERS data to the Guinea-Bissau FMC immediately in accordance with the procedures and format indicated in paragraph 2.
  
  9.
  
  The Guinea-Bissau FMC:
    
    (a)
  
  shall process all the ERS data in a confidential manner;
  
  (b)
  
  shall send the ERS data to the FMC of the vessel's flag State within 48 hours of each transhipment and/or unloading operation.

Technical failure

10.

The flag State of an EU vessel shall ensure that the master, the owner, or his representative, is informed immediately of any technical failure of the ERS system installed on his vessel.

11.

In the event of a technical failure of the ERS system, the master and/or the owner shall ensure that the ERS system is repaired or replaced within a period of one month of the breakdown.

12.

Every EU vessel fishing with a defective ERS system shall send the ERS data to the FMC of its flag State each day before 23:59 UTC by any other available electronic means of communication.

Non-receipt of ERS data

13.

The Guinea-Bissau FMC shall notify the FMC of the competent flag State and the EU without delay of any interruption in the transmission of ERS data from an EU vessel fishing under this Protocol.

14.

Following receipt of this notification, the FMC of the flag State shall immediately identify the reasons for which the ERS data could not be sent and take the appropriate measures to resolve the problem. The FMC of the flag State shall immediately inform the FMC of Guinea-Bissau and the EU of the causes identified and the corresponding corrective measures.

15.

The missing ERS data shall be sent by the FMC of the flag State to the FMC of Guinea-Bissau without delay.

16.

In the event of the FMC of Guinea-Bissau not working, the European Union shall send Guinea-Bissau the aggregate ERS data of the EU vessels which had been fishing in its waters, on a monthly basis.
