In taking measures under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, a Party will, consistent with its obligations under the WTO Agreement, consider to exclude imports of an originating product from one or several Parties if such imports do not in and of themselves cause or threaten to cause serious injury. ARTICLE 2.17. Bilateral Safeguard Measures 1. Where, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, any product originating in a Party is being imported into the territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry of like or directly competitive goods in the territory of the importing Party, the importing Party may take bilateral safeguard measures to the minimum extent necessary to remedy or prevent the injury, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 to 11. 2. If the conditions set out in paragraph 1 are met, the importing Party may take measures consisting in: (a) suspending the further reduction of any rate of customs duty for the product provided for under this Agreement; or (b) increasing the rate of customs duty for the product to a level not to exceed the lesser of: (i) the MFN rate of duty applied at the time the bilateral safeguard measure is taken; or (ii) the MFN rate of duty applied on the day immediately preceding the date of the entry into force of this Agreement. 3. Bilateral safeguard measures shall be taken for a period not exceeding one year. In exceptional circumstances, after consultations pursuant to paragraph 7, measures may be taken up to a total maximum period of three years. After a period of non-application of three years and in an emergency situation only, a Party may apply another bilateral safeguard measure in accordance with this Article. 4. Bilateral safeguard measures shall only be taken upon clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury pursuant to an investigation in accordance with the procedures laid down in the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. 5. A Party intending to take a bilateral safeguard measure under this Article shall immediately, and in any case before taking such measure, notify the other Parties. The notification shall contain all pertinent information, which shall include evidence of serious injury or threat thereof caused by increased imports, a precise description of the product involved, and the proposed measure, as well as the proposed date of introduction, expected duration and timetable for the progressive removal of the measure. 6. A Party that may be affected by a bilateral safeguard measure may request any adequate means of trade compensation in the form of substantially equivalent trade liberalisation in relation to its imports. 7. The Party intending to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure shall provide adequate opportunity for prior consultations with the Party that may be affected by the measure, with a view to reviewing the information arising from the investigation referred to in paragraph 4, exchanging views on the intended application or extension of a bilateral safeguard measure and reaching an understanding on compensation. The consultations shall take place in the Joint Committee if the Parties agree. 8. In the absence of a mutually acceptable solution within 30 days from the first day of consultations pursuant to paragraph 7, the importing Party may adopt a bilateral safeguard measure pursuant to paragraph 2 to remedy the problem, and, in the absence of mutually agreed compensation, the Party against whose product the bilateral safeguard measure is taken may take compensatory action. The bilateral safeguard measure and the compensatory action shall be immediately notified to the other Parties. In the selection of the bilateral safeguard measure and the compensatory action, priority must be given to the action which least disturbs the functioning of this Agreement. The Party taking compensatory action shall apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects and in any event, only while the measure according to paragraph 2 is being applied. 9. Upon the termination of the measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate which would have been in effect but for the bilateral safeguard measure. 10. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage, which would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a provisional bilateral safeguard measure in accordance with paragraph 2, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The Party intending to take such measure shall immediately notify the other Parties. Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notification, the procedures set out in this Article shall be initiated. Any compensation shall be based on the total period of application of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure and of the bilateral safeguard measure. 11. Any provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be terminated within 200 days at the latest. The period of application of any such provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be counted as part of the duration, and any extension thereof, of the measure, set out in paragraphs 3 and 7 respectively. Any tariff increases shall be promptly refunded if the investigation described in paragraph 4 does not result in a finding that the conditions of paragraph 1 are met. 12. The Parties shall, upon request of a Party, exchange views about the application of this Article and its effect on trade between the Parties at the meetings of the Joint Committee. ARTICLE 2.18.

A Party adopting such measure shall do so in accordance with the conditions established under the GATT 1994 and the Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement. 2.

Such treatment shall be extended to the commercial presence through which the service is supplied or sought to be supplied and need not be extended to any other parts of the service supplier located outside the territory where the service is supplied or sought to be supplied. ARTICLE 3.3. Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment 1. Without prejudice to measures taken in accordance with Article VII of the GATS, and except as provided for in its List of MFN-Exemptions contained in Annex VII. (Lists of MFN-Exemptions), each Party shall accord immediately and unconditionally, with respect to all measures affecting the supply of services, to services and service suppliers of another Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment it accords to like services and service suppliers of any non-party. 2. Treatment granted under other existing or future agreements concluded by a Party and notified under Article V or Article Vbis of the GATS shall not be subject to paragraph 1. 3. If a Party concludes an agreement of the type referred to in paragraph 2, it shall notify the other Parties without delay. The Party concluding such an agreement shall, upon request by another Party, afford adequate opportunity to negotiate the incorporation into this Agreement of a treatment no less favourable than that provided under that agreement. 4. For the purposes of this Chapter, with regard to the rights and obligations of the Parties in respect of advantages accorded to adjacent countries, paragraph 3 of Article I of the GATS shall apply and is hereby incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. ARTICLE 3.4. Market Access 1. With respect to market access through the modes of supply identified in subparagraph (r) of Article 3.2 (Definitions), each Party shall accord services and service suppliers of another Party treatment no less favourable than that provided for under the terms, limitations and conditions agreed and specified in its Schedule of Specific Commitments. (5) 2. In sectors where market access commitments are undertaken, the measures which a Party shall not maintain or adopt either on the basis of a regional subdivision or on the basis of its entire territory, unless otherwise specified in its Schedule, are defined as: (a) limitations on the number of service suppliers whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirements of an economic needs test; (b) limitations on the total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; (c) limitations on the total number of service operations or the total quantity of service output expressed in terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; (6) (d) limitations on the total number of natural persons that may be employed in a particular service sector or that a service supplier may employ and who are necessary for, and directly related to, the supply of a specific service in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; (e) measures which restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier may supply a service; and (f) limitations on the participation of foreign capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on foreign shareholding or the total value of individual or aggregate foreign investment. (5) If a Party undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in Article 3.2 (Definitions) and if the cross-border movement of capital is an essential part of the service itself, that Party is thereby committed to allow such movement of capital. (6) This subparagraph does not cover measures of a Party, which limit inputs for the supply of services. ARTICLE 3.5. National Treatment 1. In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule of Specific Commitments, and subject to the conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of another Party, in respect of all measures affecting the supply of services, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers. (7) 2. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to services and service suppliers of another Party, either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers. 3. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of a Party compared to like services or service suppliers of another Party. (7) Specific commitments assumed under this Article shall not be construed to require any Party to compensate for any inherent competitive disadvantages, which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or service suppliers. ARTICLE 3.6. Additional Commitments Parties may negotiate commitments with respect to measures affecting trade in services not subject to scheduling under Article 3.4 (Market Access) or 3.5 (National Treatment), including those regarding qualifications, standards or licensing matters. Such commitments shall be inscribed in a Party's Schedule. ARTICLE 3.7. Domestic Regulation 1. In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner. 2. (a) Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service supplier of another Party, for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services. Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review. (b) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system. 3. Where a Party requires authorisation for the supply of a service, on which a specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of that Party shall, within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application is considered complete under that Party's domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application. At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities of that Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application. 4. In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures, are based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to supply the service. 5. Upon conclusion of the multilateral negotiations on the disciplines on Domestic Regulation pursuant to Article VI:4 of the GATS, the Parties shall conduct a review for the purpose of discussing appropriate amendments to this Chapter based on the result of such multilateral negotiations. 6. (a) In sectors in which a Party has undertaken specific commitments, pending the entry into force of a decision incorporating WTO disciplines for these sectors pursuant to paragraph 5, that Party shall not apply qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures that nullify or impair such specific commitments in a manner which is: (i) more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service; or (ii) in the case of licensing procedures, in itself a restriction on the supply of the service; (b) In determining whether a Party is in conformity with the obligation under subparagraph (a), account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations (8) applied by that Party. 7. Each Party shall provide for adequate procedures to verify the competence of professionals of another Party. (8) The term \"relevant international organisations\" refers to international bodies whose membership is open to the relevant bodies of at least all Parties. ARTICLE 3.8.. Recognition 1. For the purposes of the fulfilment of its relevant standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, each Party shall give due consideration to requests by another Party to recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted in that Party. Such recognition may be based upon an agreement or arrangement with the requesting Party, or be accorded autonomously. 2. Where a Party recognises, by agreement or arrangement, the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of a non-party, that Party shall afford another Party adequate opportunity to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for another Party to demonstrate that the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of that Party should also be recognised. 3. Any such agreement or arrangement or autonomous recognition shall be in conformity with the relevant provisions of the WTO Agreement, in particular paragraph 3 of Article VI of the GATS. ARTICLE 3.9. Movement of Natural Persons 1. This Article applies to measures affecting natural persons who are service suppliers of a Party, and natural persons of a Party who are employed by a service supplier of a Party, in respect of the supply of a service. 2. This Chapter shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of a Party, nor shall it apply to measures regarding nationality, residence or employment on a permanent basis. 3. Natural persons covered by a specific commitment shall be allowed to supply the service in accordance with the terms of that commitment. 4. This Chapter shall not prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons of another Party into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across, its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Party under the terms of a specific commitment. (9) (9) The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under a specific commitment. ARTICLE 3.10. Transparency 1. Each Party shall publish promptly and, except in emergency situations, at the latest by the time of their entry into force, all relevant measures of general application which pertain to or affect the operation of this Chapter. International agreements pertaining to or affecting trade in services to which a Party is a signatory shall also be published. 2. Where publication as referred to in paragraph 1 is not practicable, such information shall be made otherwise publicly available. 3. Nothing in this Chapter shall require any Party to disclose confidential information, which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or that would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private. 4. Each Party shall treat as confidential the information submitted by another Party, which has been designated as confidential by the Party submitting the information. ARTICLE 3.11. Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers 1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with that Party's obligations under Article 3.3 (Most-FavouredNation Treatment) and specific commitments. 2. Where a Party's monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to that Party's specific commitments, that Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments. 3. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect: (a) authorises or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and (b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory. ARTICLE 3.12. Business Practices 1. The Parties recognise that certain business practices of service suppliers, other than those falling under Article 3.11 (Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers), may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in services. 2. Each Party shall, at the request of another Party, enter into consultations with a view to eliminating practices referred to in paragraph 1. The Party addressed shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall cooperate through the supply of publicly available non-confidential information of relevance to the matter in question. The Party addressed shall also provide other information available to the requesting Party, subject to its domestic laws and regulations and to the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting Party. ARTICLE 3.13. Payments and Transfers 1. Subject to its specific commitments and except under the circumstances referred to in Article 3.14 (Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments), no Party shall apply restrictions on international transfers and payments for current transactions with another Party. 2. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties under the Articles of Agreement of the IMF, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the IMF, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on capital transactions inconsistent with its specific commitments regarding such transactions, except under Article 3.14 (Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments) or at the request of the IMF. ARTICLE 3.14. Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments For the purposes of this Chapter, paragraphs 1 to 3 of Article XII of the GATS, shall apply and are hereby incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. ARTICLE 3.15. Consultation on Implementation If, after the entry into force of this Agreement, difficulties arise in a services sector of a Party where that Party has undertaken a specific commitment, that Party may request consultations with the other Parties, regardless whether such difficulties arise from liberalisation or not, for the purposes of exchanging information, data or experience, or exchanging views on possible ways and means to address such difficulties, taking into account the circumstances of the case at hand. ARTICLE 3.16. General Exceptions Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade in services, nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from the adoption or enforcement of measures: (a) necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order (10); (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; (c) necessary to secure compliance with domestic laws and regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter including those relating to: (i) the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or dealing with the effects of a default on services contracts; (ii) the protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and accounts; (iii) safety; (d) inconsistent with Article 3.5 (National Treatment), provided that the difference in treatment is aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective (11) imposition or collection of direct taxes with respect to services or service suppliers of the other Parties; (e) inconsistent with Article 3.3 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), provided that the difference in treatment is the result of an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation or provisions on the avoidance of double taxation in any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Party is bound. (10) The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society. (11) Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a Party under its taxation system which: (i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Party's territory; or (ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party's territory; or (iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures; or (iv) apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of another Party in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the Party's territory; or (v) distinguish service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or (vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Party's tax base. Tax terms or concepts in subparagraph (d) of this Article and in this footnote are determined according to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic laws and regulations of the Party taking the measure. ARTICLE 3.17. Security Exceptions Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to: (a) require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or (b) prevent a Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests: (i) relating to the supply of services as carried out directly or indirectly for the purposes of provisioning a military establishment; (ii) relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; (iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations; or (c) prevent a Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.

The first such review shall take place no later than five years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. ARTICLE 3.21.

The Parties may cooperate to exchange information relating to the development of competition policy, subject to their domestic laws and regulations and available resources.
