1. A good that does not satisfy a change in tariff classification requirement
pursuant to Annex 2 (Product Specific Rules Schedule) shall nonetheless be treated
as an originating good if:

requirement for the good.
Article 3.6
Accessories, Spare Parts, Tools and Instructional or other Information
Materials
1. For the purposes of determining the origin of a good, accessories, spare parts,
tools and instructional or other information materials presented with the good shall be
considered originating goods and shall be disregarded in determining whether all the
non-originating materials used in the production of the originating good have
undergone the applicable change in tariff classification or production process.
2. If the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of the
accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information materials
presented with the good is to be taken into account as originating or non-originating,
as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.
- 14 -
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall only apply provided that:
(a) the accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or other information
materials presented with the good are not invoiced separately from the

materials presented with the good are not customary for the good or are invoiced
separately from the good, they shall be treated as separate goods for the purpose of
origin determination.
Article 3.7
Fungible Materials
1. The determination of whether fungible materials are originating goods shall be
made either by physical segregation of each of the materials, or through the use of
an inventory management method recognised in the generally accepted accounting
principles of the Party in which the production is performed or otherwise accepted by
that Party.
2. The inventory management method used under paragraph 1 for a particular
fungible material shall continue to be used for that material throughout the fiscal year.
Article 3.8

1. Packing materials and containers for transportation and shipment of a good
shall not be taken into account for determining the origin of any good.
2. Packing materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale,
when classified together with that good shall not be taken into account in determining
whether all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good have
met the applicable change in tariff classification or production process requirements
as set out in Annex 2 (Product Specific Rules Schedule).
3. If a good is subject to a regional value content requirement then the value of
the packaging materials and containers in which the good is packaged for retail sale
shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case
may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.
4. Where the packaging material and container is not customary for the good, its
value shall not be included as originating in a regional value content calculation for
the good.
- 15 -
Article 3.9
Indirect Material
An indirect material shall be treated as an originating material without regard to
where it is produced and its value shall be the cost registered in the accounting
records of the producer of the good.

Regional Value Content
1. Where Annex 2 (Product Specific Rules Schedule) refers to a regional value
content requirement, the regional value content of that good shall be calculated using
one of the following methods:
Build-down Method/ Indirect Method
RVC =
V - VNM
----------------
V
x 100
or
Build-up Method
RVC =
VOM
----------------

earliest ascertainable price paid or payable for the material; or
- 17 -
(c) for a material that is self-produced, the sum of all expenses incurred in
the production of the material, including general expenses, and an
amount for profit equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of
trade.
2. The value of materials may be adjusted as follows:
(a) for originating materials, the following expenses may be added to the

technical standards that nullify or impair such specific commitments under this
Agreement in a manner which:
(a) does not comply with the criteria outlined in subparagraphs 2(a), (b) or
(c); and
(b) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the
specific commitments in those sectors were made.
4. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations under
subparagraph 3(a), account shall be taken of international standards of relevant
international organisations applied by that Party10
.

reasonable timeframe;
(b) within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an
application considered complete under laws and regulations, inform the
applicant of the decision concerning the application;

Recognition
1. A Party may recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements
met, or licences or certification granted in the other Party for purposes of the
fulfilment, in whole or in part, of its standards or criteria for the authorisation,
licensing, or certification of service suppliers of the other Party, subject to the
requirements of paragraph 4.
2. Recognition referred to in paragraph 1, which may be achieved through
harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement
between the Parties or may be accorded unilaterally.

education or experience obtained, requirements met or licences or certifications
granted in the territory of a non-Party, a Party that is a party to an agreement or
arrangement of the type referred to in paragraph 2, whether existing or future, shall
afford adequate opportunity for the other Party, if the other Party is interested, to
negotiate accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to negotiate a
comparable one with it. Where a Party accords recognition unilaterally, it shall afford
the other Party an adequate opportunity to demonstrate that the education or
experience obtained, requirements met or licences or certifications obtained in the
other Party should also be recognised.
4. A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which could constitute a
means of discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or
criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers or a
disguised restriction on trade in services.
Article 8.11
Monopoly and Exclusive Services Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory
does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a
manner inconsistent with that Party‟s obligations under Article 8.3 (National
Treatment) and Article 8.5 (Market Access).
2. Where a Party's monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an
affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights
and which is subject to that Party's specific commitments the Party shall ensure that 
- 57 -
such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner
inconsistent with such commitments.
3. If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of the
other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, it may request
the Party establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to provide specific
information concerning the relevant operations in its territory.
4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service
suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect:
(a) authorises or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and
(b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.
Article 8.12
Business Practices
1. Parties recognise that certain business practices of service suppliers, other
than those falling under Article 8.11 (Monopoly and Exclusive Services Suppliers),
may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in services.
2. Each Party shall, at the request of the other Party, enter into consultations
with a view to eliminating practices referred to in paragraph 1. The Party addressed
shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall
cooperate through the supply of publicly available non-confidential information
available to the requesting Party. The requested Party may also provide other
information available to the requesting Party, subject to its laws and regulations and
to the conclusion of satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding of its
confidentiality by the requesting Party.

by a specific commitment in Annex 3 (Schedules of Specific Services
Commitments) or Annex 4 (Schedules of Movement of Natural Persons
Commitments); and
(b) a Party provides for more favourable treatment under this Agreement
than the Party is obliged to provide to services and service suppliers of
the other Party under GATS or the AANZFTA Agreement at the time
this Agreement enters into force,
- 58 -
the affected Party may request consultations with the other Party to deal with such
situation and the requested Party shall respond to the request in good faith.

mutually acceptable solution within a reasonable time.
Article 8.14
Payments and Transfers
1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 18.4 (Measures to
Safeguard the Balance-of-Payments) of Chapter 18 (General Provisions and
Exceptions), a Party shall not apply restrictions on international transfers and
payments for current transactions relating to its specific commitments.
2. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties as
members of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the IMF Articles of
Agreement, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the
IMF Articles of Agreement, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any
capital transactions inconsistently with its commitments under this Chapter regarding
such transactions, except under Article 18.4 (Measures to Safeguard the Balance-ofPayments) of Chapter 18 (General Provisions and Exceptions), or at the request of
the IMF.

prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment in financial institutions or trade in
financial services.

telecommunications regulatory body provides the access seeker with a clear and
transparent explanation of its decision to deny such access.
SECTION D
Other Measures
Article 9.19
Independent Regulatory Bodies and Government Ownership
1. Each Party shall ensure that any telecommunications regulatory body that it
establishes or maintains is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of

telecommunications regulatory body shall be fair and impartial and shall be made
and implemented without undue delay.

frequencies allocated for specific government uses.
3. A Party‟s measures allocating and assigning spectrum and managing
frequency are not measures that are per se inconsistent with Article 8.5 (Market
Access) of Chapter 8 (Trade in Services). Accordingly, each Party retains the right to
establish and apply spectrum and frequency management policies that may have the 
- 78 -
effect of limiting the number of suppliers of public telecommunications networks or
services, provided it does so in a manner consistent with other provisions of this
Agreement. This includes the ability to allocate frequency bands, taking into account
current and future needs and spectrum availability.
4. When making a spectrum allocation for non-government telecommunications

relief (on an interim or final basis), or the modification, suspension, and revocation of
licenses.

and Use of Scarce Resources), each Party shall ensure that:
(a) regulatory decisions, including the basis for such decisions of its
telecommunications regulatory body, are promptly published or
otherwise made available to all interested persons; and
(b) its measures relating to public telecommunications networks or services
are made publicly available, including measures relating to:

services, subject to requirements necessary to satisfy legitimate public policy
interests15
.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may apply measures that limit the
technologies or standards that a supplier of public telecommunications networks or

which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between
Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment flows,
nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by

- 98 -
ANNEX ON EXPROPRIATION
1. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation
unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in a
covered investment.
2. Article 12.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) addresses two situations:
(a) the first is direct expropriation, where a covered investment is
nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of
title or outright seizure;
(b) the second is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions
by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal
transfer of title or outright seizure.
3. The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a
specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case,
fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:
(a) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an
action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the
economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish
that an indirect expropriation has occurred;
(b) whether the government action breaches the government‟s prior binding
written commitment, where applicable, to the investor whether by
contract, licence or other legal document; and
(c) the character of the government action, including, its objective and
whether the action is disproportionate to the public purpose27
.
4. Non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied
to achieve legitimate public welfare objectives, such as the protection of public
health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.

27 “Public purpose” shall be read with reference to subparagraph (1)(a) of Article 12.8 (Expropriation
and Compensation).

Complaining Party shall apply the following principles:
(a) the Complaining Party should first seek to suspend concessions or
other obligations in the same sector or sectors as that affected by the

that the principles set forth in paragraph 6 have not been followed, the Responding
Party may request the arbitral tribunal to reconvene to make findings on the matter.

reached.

exercised under this Article, if the Responding Party considers that:
(a) the level of concessions or other obligations suspended by the
Complaining Party is not equivalent to the level of the nullification and
impairment; or
(b) it has complied with the obligation in paragraph 1 of Article 20.14
(Implementation),
