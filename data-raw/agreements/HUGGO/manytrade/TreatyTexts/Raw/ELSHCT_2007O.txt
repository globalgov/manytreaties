(a) request information about the origin of a good from the certifying authority of the
exporting Party; and,
(b) request its Embassy in the territory of the other Party for assistance in those matters.
5-5 
2. For purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the
territory of the other Party under preferential tariff treatment according to this agreement
qualifies as originating, a Party may verify the origin of the good through its competent
authority by means of:

(a) written questionnaires or requests for information sent directly to the importer in its
territory or the exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party;
(b) verification visits to the exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party to
review the records and documents referred to in Article 5.05 (a), and to inspect the
materials and facilities used in the production of the good in question;
(c) delegating its Embassy in the territory of the other Party to conduct the verification
visit; or
(d) other procedures as the Parties may agree to.
3. For the purposes of this Article, the questionnaires, requests, official letters,
determinations of origin, notifications or any other written communications sent by the
competent authority to the importer, exporter or the producer for origin verification, shall
be considered valid, provided that they are done by the following means:
(a) certified mails with receipts of acknowledgement or other ways that confirm that the
importer, exporter or producer has received the documents;

importer, exporter or producer does not duly complete and return the questionnaire
or does not provide the information requested within such time period.
5. The importer, exporter or producer who receives a questionnaire or request for
information according to paragraph 2 (a) shall duly complete and return the
questionnaire or respond to the request for information within the time period established
in paragraph 4 (a) from the date of receipt. During that time period, the importer,
5-6 
exporter or producer may make a written request to the competent authority of the
importing Party for an extension of no more than thirty (30) days. A Party shall not deny
the preferential tariff treatment based solely on the request of an extension for
completing and returning the questionnaire or responding to the information request.
6. Each Party shall provide that, even if the answered questionnaire or information
requested referred to in paragraph 5 has been received within the specified time period,
it may still request, through its competent authority, additional information from the
importer, exporter or producer, by means of a subsequent questionnaire or request. In
such cases the importer, exporter or producer shall answer the questionnaire or respond
to the request within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt.
7. If the importer, exporter or producer does not duly complete a questionnaire, or does
not return the questionnaire or provide the information requested within the time period
established in paragraphs 4 (a), 5 and 6 above, the importing Party may deny
preferential tariff treatment to the goods subject to verification, by issuing a written
determination of origin, including facts and the legal basis for that determination, to the
importer, exporter or producer.
8. Prior to conducting a verification visit according to paragraph 2 (b), the importing Party
shall, through its competent authority, provide a written notification of its intention to
conduct the visit. The notification shall be sent to the exporter or producer to be visited,
the importer, to the certifying authority and the competent authority of the Party in whose
territory the visit will be conducted, and, if necessary, to the embassy of the other Party
in the territory of the importing Party. The competent authority of the importing Party
shall request the written consent from the exporter or producer to be visited, to make a
verification visit.
9. The notification referred to in paragraph 8 shall include:
(a) the name of the competent authority that sends the notification;
(b) the name of the exporter or producer to be visited;

(d) the objective and scope of the verification visit, including the specific reference to the
good subject to verification;
(e) the names and positions of the officers conducting the verification visit; and
(f) the legal basis for carrying out the verification visit.
Any modification of the information referred to in this paragraph shall also be notified
according to paragraph 8.
5-7 
10. If the exporter or producer has not given his written consent for the making of the
proposed verification visit within the thirty (30) days of the written notification as provided
in paragraphs 8 and 9, the importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the
good by notifying in writing to the importer, exporter or producer the determination of
origin, including facts and the legal basis for such denial.
11. When the exporter or producer receives a notification according to paragraphs 8 and
9, within the fifteen (15) days from the date on which the notification was received may,
one time only, request in writing the postposition of the visit with the corresponding
justifications, for a period no longer than thirty (30) days from the date on which the
notification was received, or for a longer term the competent authority of the importing
Party and the exporter or producer may agree. For these purposes, the competent
authority of the importing Party shall notify the postposition of the visit to the importer,
exporter or producer of the good, the competent authority and the certifying authority of
the exporting Party.
12. A Party shall not deny the preferential tariff treatment based solely on the request to
postpone the verification visit, according to paragraph 11.
13. Each Party shall permit an exporter or producer who is subject to a verification visit
to designate two observers to be present during the visit, provided that the observers
only participate in that manner. Nevertheless, the failure to designate the observers shall
not be a cause for postponing the visit.
14. Each Party shall require that an exporter or a producer provides the records and
documents referred to in Article 5.05(a) to the competent authority of the importing Party
conducting a verification visit. If the records and documents are not in possession of the
exporter or producer, the exporter may request to the producer of the good or the
producer may request the supplier of the materials, to deliver these to the competent
authority of the importing Party.
15. A Party may deny the preferential tariff treatment to an imported good subject to an
origin verification, if the exporter or producer:
(a) fails to provide the records or documents for determining the origin of the good, in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and of Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin); or
(b) denies access to the records or documents.
16. Each Party, through its competent authority, shall verify the compliance of the
requirements of regional value content, De Minimis, or any other provision contained in
Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) in compliance with the generally accepted accounting
principles that apply in the territory of the Party from which the good was exported.
5-8 
17. Once the verification visit has been concluded, the competent authority of the
importing Party shall prepare a minute of the visit, which shall include the facts
confirmed by it. The exporter or producer, subject to the verification visit, may sign this
minute.
18. Within a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days from the conclusion of the
verification of origin, the competent authority of the importing Party shall issue a
determination of origin, in writing, in which it is determined if the good qualifies or not as
originating, which shall include the factual findings and legal basis for the determination
of origin and notify the importer, exporter or producer, as well as the competent authority
and certifying authority of the exporting Party the determination of origin.
19. When the period established in paragraph 18 concludes and the competent authority
of the importing Party does not issue a determination of origin, the good subject to the
verification of origin shall receive the same preferential tariff treatment as if it were an
originating good.
20. Where through a verification the importing Party determines that an importer,
exporter or a producer has provided more than once, a false or unfounded certificate of
origin or stating that a good qualifies as originating, the importing Party may suspend
preferential tariff treatment to the identical goods imported, exported or produced by that
person, until it is proved that such person is in compliance with all the requirements
under Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) and this Chapter.
21. When the competent authority of the importing Party determines that a good
imported into its territory does not qualify as originating, the importer must pay any
custom duties owed and other applicable charges according to the legislation of each
Party.
22. In case the preferential tariff treatment is resumed, the competent authority of the
importing Party shall issue a written determination of origin in which the competent
authority of the importing Party establishes the resumption of the preferential tariff
treatment for the good, shall be notified to the importer, exporter or producer and the
competent authority and certifying authority of the exporting Party; which shall include
the factual findings and the legal basis of its determination.
23. A Party shall not apply a determination of origin issued under paragraph 18 to an
importation made before the date of entry into force of the determination origin where:
(a) the customs authority of the exporting Party issued an advance ruling regarding the
tariff classification or valuation of one or more materials used in the good under
Article 5.07;
5-9 
(b) the importing Party‚Äôs determination is based on a tariff classification or valuation for
such materials that is different than that provided for in the advance ruling referred to
in subparagraph (a); and

advance ruling, prior to the importation of a good into its territory. The advance ruling
shall be issued in response to a written application made by an importer in its territory or

circumstances stated by such importer, exporter or producer of the good, with respect
to:

Party, according to the norms and principles of the Customs Valuation Agreement, to
calculate the transaction value of a good or of the materials used in the production of
the good, with respect to which an advance ruling is being requested, is adequate for
demonstrating whether the good satisfies a regional value content requirement
according to Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) and in Annex 4.03 (Specific Rules of Origin);

(e) such other matters as the Parties may agree.
2. Each Party shall establish directives for the issuance of advance rulings, including:

issuing authority, a judicial decision or to adjust to a change in the national legislation
of the Party that issued the advance ruling.
6. Each Party shall provide that any modification or revocation of an advance ruling shall
enter into force from the date on which the modification or revocation is issued, or on
such later date as may be specified therein, and shall not be applied to the importation
5-11 
of a good having occurred prior to that date, unless the person to whom the advance
ruling was issued has not acted according to its terms and conditions.
7. Each Party shall provide that, when its competent authority verifies the origin of a

Article 6.03 Global Safeguard Measures
1. Each Party shall reserve its rights and obligations in accordance with Article

Article.
2. Any Party applying a safeguard measure in accordance with paragraph 1 shall
exclude from this measure, goods imported from the other Party, unless:
(a) imports from the other Party account for a substantial share of total imports.
Those imports normally shall not be considered to be substantial if that Party is
not among the top three suppliers of the good subject to the proceeding,
measured in terms of its import share during the most recent three (3) year
period; and
 6- 3
(b) imports from the other Party contribute importantly to the serious injury, or
threat thereof, caused by total imports. To determine this, the investigating
authority shall consider factors such as the change in the import share of the
other Party in the total imports, as well as the import volume of the other Party
and the changes in that volume. Normally, the imports from a Party shall not be
considered to contribute importantly to serious injury, or threat thereof, if its
growth rate of imports from a Party, during the period in which the injurious
surge in imports occurred, is appreciably lower than the growth rate of total
imports from all sources during the same period.

other Party mutually agreed trade liberalization compensation, in the form of
concessions, having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the
additional customs tariff expected to result from the safeguard measure.

whose good the safeguard measure is applied may impose measures which have
trade effects substantially equivalent to the effects of the safeguard measure
applied pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article.
Article 6.04 Administration of the Safeguard Measure Proceedings
1. Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and reasonable application of
the applicable legislation of each Party, regulations, decisions and rulings

going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property,
and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.
3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and be fully realizable.

 For greater certainty, this term refers to a concept of customary international law.
 10-10
4. The amount paid as compensation shall be no less than the equivalent amount
that would have been paid on that date to the expropriated investor in a currency of
free convertibility in the international financial market according to the exchange
rate in force on the date in which the fair market price was determined. The
compensation shall include the payment of interests computed from the day of
dispossession of the expropriated investment until the day of payment, and shall
be computed on the basis of a commercially applicable rate for this currency set by
the national bank system of the Party where the expropriation occurred.
5. Upon payment, the compensation shall be freely transferable according to
Article 10.10.
6. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in
relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation, or creation of
intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation,
or creation is consistent with the TRIPS.
7. For purposes of this Article and for greater certainty, a non-discriminatory
measure of general application shall not be considered a measure tantamount to
an expropriation of a debt security or loan covered by this Chapter solely on the
ground that the measure imposes costs on the debtor that cause it to default on the
debt.
Article 10.12 Special Formalities and Information Requirements
1. Nothing in Article 10.03 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or
maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the
establishment of investments by investors of the other Party, such as a
requirement that investors be residents of the Party or that investments be legally
constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that such
formalities do not materially impair the protections afforded by a Party to investors
of the other Party and investments of investors of the other Party pursuant to this
Chapter.
2. Notwithstanding Articles 10.03 and 10.04, a Party may require an investor of the
other Party, or its investment in its territory, to provide routine information
concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes. The
Party shall protect any confidential information from any disclosure that would
prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the investment. Nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or
disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good faith application of
its law.
Article 10.13 Relation to Other Chapters
1. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter, the
latter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
 10-11
2. A requirement by a Party that a service provider of the other Party post a bond
or other form of financial security as a condition for providing a cross-border
service into its territory does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to the
rendering of that cross-border service. This Chapter applies to that Party's
treatment of the posted bond or financial security.
Article 10.14 Denial of Benefits
Subject to previous notification and consultation done according to Articles 13.04
(Provision of Information) and 15.05 (Consultations), a Party may deny the benefits
under this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of such
other Party and to the investment of this investor, if the investors of a non-Party
own or control, (directly or indirectly) the enterprise and the enterprise has no
substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is
constituted or organized.
Article 10.15 Subrogation
1. When one Party, or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation
designated by it, has furnished an insurance contract or any other financial
guarantee against non-commercial risks, relating to any investment of one of the
investors of the other Party, the latter shall recognize the rights of the first Party to
subrogate in the rights of the investor, whenever a payment has been made by
virtue of such contract or guarantee.
2. When one Party, or any agency, institution, statutory body or corporation
designated by it, has paid its investors and by that virtue has acquired his rights
and benefits, such investors may not claim such rights and benefits to the other
Party, except by express authorization of the first Party. For greater certainty, the
same claim can only be submitted either by the investor or the Party.
Article 10.16 Environmental Measures
1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting,
maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it
considers appropriate to ensure that the investment activity in its territory is
undertaken in compliance with its ecological or environmental laws and
regulations.
2. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by
relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party
shall not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate
from, such measures as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition,
expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Party
considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request
 10-12
consultations with the other Party, within the Committee of Investment and Crossborder Trade in Services3
.

other Party

by that Party has breached an obligation under this Chapter, whenever the
enterprise has suffered losses or damages due to that violation.
2. An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise described in
paragraph 1 if more than three (3) years have elapsed from the date on which the
enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged
breach and knowledge that the enterprise has suffered losses or damages.
3. Where an investor makes a claim under this Article and the investor or a noncontrolling investor in the enterprise makes a claim under Article 10.18 arising out
of the same events that gave rise to the claim under this Article, and two or more of

the law of the disputing Party.

ANNEX 10 A
Customary International Law
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that ‚Äúcustomary international law‚Äù
generally and as specifically referenced in Articles 10.05 and 10.11 results from a
general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal
obligation. The customary international law minimum standard of treatment of
aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic
rights and interests of aliens.
 10-25
ANNEX 10 B
Expropriation
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:
1. Article 10.11 (1) is intended to reflect customary international law concerning the
obligation of States with respect to expropriation.
2. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation
unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in
an investment.
3. Article 10.11 (1) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where
an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal
transfer of title or outright seizure.
4. The second situation addressed by Article 10.11 (1) is indirect expropriation,
where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct
expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
(a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a
specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by
case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:
(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an
action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the
economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that
an indirect expropriation has occurred;
(ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct,
reasonable investment-backed expectations; and
(iii) the character of the government action.
(b) Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party
that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives,
such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect
expropriations.
 10-26

and will therefore govern the relations between the Parties regarding the promotion
and protection of investments.
Henceforth, all investments made after the entry into force of this Agreement by an
investor of a Party in the territory of another Party, will be governed by the
provisions contained in this Chapter.
Any covered investments existing prior to the entry into force of this Agreement will
be governed at election of the investor by the corresponding Bilateral Investment
Agreement or this Chapter for a term of ten (10) years after the entry into force of
this Agreement. After the expiration of said term, those investments will be
governed by the provisions contained in this Chapter.
Moreover, and only for the covered investments made prior to the entry into force
of this Agreement, any dispute arising with regards to them will be governed, at the
election of the investor, by the corresponding Bilateral Investment Agreement or
this Chapter for a term of ten (10) years after the entry into force of this Agreement.
After the expiration of said term, any dispute that arises and that is covered by the
protections of this Agreement will be governed by the provisions contained in this
Chapter.
For greater certainty, an investor, either on his behalf or on the behalf of an
enterprise, cannot submit the same claim to both Investor-State Dispute Resolution
Mechanisms. The election of one or the other mechanism will be definite and
exclusive.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term ‚Äúcovered investment‚Äù, means an
investment that was made in accordance with the terms of the Bilateral Investment
Agreements referred to above, and was therefore a protected investment under
those Agreements.
