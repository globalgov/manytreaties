For the purposes of this Chapter, a good produced from non-originating materials that undergo a change in tariff classification and satisfy the other requirements set out in Article 4-03 shall have been produced entirely in the territory of one or both Parties and the entire regional value content of the good shall be met in the territory of one or both Parties. Article 4-04 Regional Value Content 1. Except as provided in paragraph 5, each Party shall provide that the regional value content of a good shall be calculated, at the choice of the exporter or producer of the good, on the basis of either the transaction value method set out in paragraph 2 or the net cost method set out in paragraph 4. 2. The regional value content of a good may be calculated on the basis of the following transaction value method: WT/REG125/1 Page 28 TV - VNM RVC = -------------- x 100 TV where RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; TV is the transaction value of the good adjusted to a F.O.B. basis, except as provided in paragraph 3; and VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good, determined in accordance with Article 4-05. 2. For the purposes of paragraph 2, where the producer of the good does not export it directly, the transaction value shall be adjusted to the point at which the purchaser receives the good within the territory where the producer is located. 3. The regional value content of a good may be calculated on the basis of the following net cost method: NC - VNM RVC = -------------- x 100 NC where RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; NC is the net cost of the good; and VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good, determined in accordance with Article 4-05. 5. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer shall calculate the regional value content of a good solely on the basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 4 where: (a) there is no transaction value for the good because it is not for sale; (b) the transaction value of the good cannot be determined owing t o restrictions on the assignment or use of the good by the buyer with the exception of those that: (i) are imposed or required by the law or the authorities of the Party in which the purchaser of the good is located, WT/REG125/1 Page 29 (ii) limit the geographical territory in which the good can be resold, or (iii) do not substantially affect the value of the good; (c) the sale or the price depends on a condition or consideration whose value cannot be determined in relation to the good; (d) part of the proceeds from the resale of the product or from any subsequent assignment or use of the good by the buyer reverts directly or indirectly to the vendor, unless the necessary adjustment can be made in accordance with Article 8 of the Customs Valuation Code; (e) the buyer and the vendor are related persons and the relationship between them influences the price, except as provided in paragraph 2, Article 1, of the Customs Valuation Code; (f) the good is sold by the producer to a related person and the volume, by units of quantity, of sales of identical or similar goods sold t o related persons during the six-month period immediately preceding the month in which the good is sold by the producer exceeds 85 per cent of the producer’s total sales of such goods during that period; (g) the exporter or producer chooses to accumulate the regional value content of the good in accordance with Article 4-08; or (h) the good is designated as an intermediate material under Article 4-07 and is subject to a regional value-content requirement. 6. If an exporter or producer of a good calculates the regional value content of the good on the basis of the transaction value method set out in paragraph 2 and a Party subsequently notifies the exporter or producer, during the course of a verification pursuant to Chapter 5 (Customs Procedures), that the transaction value of the good, or the value of any material used in the production of the good, is required to be adjusted or is unacceptable under paragraph 5, the exporter or producer may then also calculate the regional value content of the good on the basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 4. 7. With the exception of the goods covered in Article 4-15, a producer may average the regional value content of one or all of the goods included in the same subheading, that are produced by the same plant or in different plants in the territory of a Party, either taking as the base all the goods produced by the producer or only the goods that are exported to the other Party: (a) in the fiscal year or period; or (b) in any monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, four-monthly or semiannual period. WT/REG125/1 Page 30 8. Article 20-10 (Revocations and Transitory Provisions) shall apply to goods classified in subheadings 8422.40 and 8431.43. Article 4-05 Value of Materials 1. The value of a material shall: (a) be the transaction value of the material; or (b) in the event that there is no transaction value or the transaction value of the material is unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, be determined in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 of the Customs Valuation Code. 2. Where not included under paragraph 1 (a) or (b), the value of a material shall include: (a) freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the material from the port of importation in the territory of the Party where the producer is located, except as provided in paragraph 3; (b) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less any costs recovered, provided the recovery does not exceed 30 per cent of the value of the material, determined in accordance with paragraph 1. 3. Where the producer of a good buys a non-originating material in the territory of the Party where the producer is located, the value of the non-originating material shall not include freight, insurance, packing or any other cost incurred in transporting the material from the warehouse of the supplier to the location of the producer. 4. To calculate the regional value content under Article 4-04, the value of the non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of a good shall not include the value of the non-originating materials used by: (a) another producer in the production of an originating material that is purchased and used by the producer of the good in its production; or (b) the producer of the good in the production of a self-manufactured originating material, designated by the producer as an intermediate material in accordance with Article 4-07. Article 4-06 De Minimis 1. A good shall be considered to be an originating good if the value of all nonoriginating materials used in the production of the good that do not undergo an WT/REG125/1 Page 31 applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4-03 is not more than eight per cent of the transaction value of the good, adjusted on the basis of Article 4-04 (2) or (3) as appropriate, or in the cases referred to in Article 4-04 (5), if the value of all non-originating materials is not more than eight per cent of the total cost of the good. 2. If a good mentioned in paragraph 1 is also subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of such non-originating materials shall be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the good and the good must satisfy all other applicable requirements of this Chapter. 3. A good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement established in Annex 4-03 shall not be required to satisfy such requirement if the value of all nonoriginating materials is not more than eight per cent of the transaction value of the good, adjusted on the basis of Article 4-04 (2) or (3) as appropriate, or in the cases referred to in Article 4-04 (5), if the value of all non-originating materials is not more than eight per cent of the total cost. 4. Paragraph 1 does not apply to: (a) goods provided for in Chapter 50 through 63 of the Harmonized System; or (b) a non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in Chapter 1 through 27 of the Harmonized System unless the non-originating material is provided for in a different subheading than the good for which origin is being determined under this Article. Article 4-07 Intermediate Materials 1. For the purposes of calculating the regional value content under Article 4-04, the producer of a good may designate as an intermediate material, any self-produced material used in the production of the good, provided such material is an originating good as established in Article 4-03. 2. Where an intermediate material is subject to a regional value content under Annex 4-03, the value shall be calculated on the basis of the net cost method established in Article 4-04 (4). 3. For the purposes of calculating the regional value content of a good, the value of the intermediate material shall be the total cost that can reasonably be assigned to that intermediate material as established in the Uniform Regulations of this Chapter. 4. If a material designated as an intermediate material is subject to a regional value content, no other self-produced material subject to a regional value content used in the production of that intermediate material may be designated by the producer as an intermediate material. WT/REG125/1 Page 32 5. Except where two or more producers accumulate their production under Article 4-08, the restriction established in paragraph 4 shall not apply to an intermediate material used by another producer in the production of a material that is subsequently purchased and used in the production of a good by the producer mentioned in paragraph 4. Article 4-08 Accumulation 1. For the purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good, the producer of a good may choose to accumulate own production with that of one or more producers in the territory of one or both Parties of materials that are incorporated into that good, so that the production of the materials is considered t o have been performed by that producer, provided the good complies with the requirements of Article 4-03. 2. In cases in which the accumulated good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the calculation shall be performed on the basis of the net cost method. Article 4-09 Fungible Goods and Materials 1. For the purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good when originating and non-originating fungible materials are commingled in the inventory, the origin of the materials may be determined on the basis of any of the inventory management methods set out in the Uniform Regulations. 2. Where originating and non-originating fungible goods are commingled in the inventory and do not undergo any productive process or any other operation in the territory of the Party in which they were commingled, other than unloading, reloading or any other movement necessary to maintain the goods in good condition or ship them to the territory of the other Party, the origin of the good may be determined on the basis of any of the inventory management methods set out in the Uniform Regulations. 3. Once one of the inventory management methods set out in the Uniform Regulations has been selected, it shall be used during the entire fiscal year or period. WT/REG125/1 Page 33 Article 4-10 Sets and Assortments 1.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a set or assortment of goods shall be considered originating if the value of all the non-originating goods used to form the set or assortment does not exceed eight per cent of the transaction value of the set or assortment, adjusted on the basis of paragraph 2 or 3 of Article 4-04 as applicable or, in the cases referred to in Article 4-04 (5), if the value of all the nonoriginating goods does not exceed eight per cent of the total value of the set or assortment. 3. The provisions of this Article shall take precedence over the specific rules established in Annex 4-03. Article 4-11 Indirect Materials An indirect material shall be considered to be an originating material without regard to where it is produced and the value of such material shall be the cost reported in the accounting records of the producer of the good. Article 4-12 Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools 1. Accessories, spare parts or tools delivered with the good that form part of the good’s standard accessories, spare parts, or tools shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4-03, provided that: (a) the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced separately from the good, regardless of whether they are listed separately in the invoice; and (b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts or tools are customary for the good. 2. If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts or tools shall be taken into account as originating or WT/REG125/1 Page 34 non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good. 3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, where the accessories, spare parts or tools are self-produced, the producer may opt to designate them as intermediate materials under Article 4-07. Article 4-13 Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale 1. Packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale shall, if classified with the good in the Harmonized System, be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4-03. 2. If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of such packaging materials and containers shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good. 3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, when the packaging materials and containers are self-produced, the producer may designate them as intermediate materials under Article 4-07. Article 4-14 Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment Packing materials and containers in which a good is packed for shipment shall be disregarded in determining whether: (a) the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4-03; and (b) the good satisfies a regional value-content requirement.

The Certificate of Origin referred to in paragraph 1 shall serve to certify that a good exported from the territory of one Party to the territory of the other Party qualifies as an originating good. The certificate shall remain valid for up to two years after it is signed. 3. Each Party shall require its exporters to complete and sign a Certificate of Origin for any exportation of a good for which an importer may claim preferential tariff treatment. 4. Each Party shall require that: (a) where an exporter is not the producer of the good, the exporter may complete and sign a Certificate of Origin on the basis of: (i) its knowledge of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, (ii) its reasonable reliance on the producer’s written representation that the good qualifies as an originating good, or (iii) the declaration of origin referred to in paragraph 1; (b) the declaration of origin applicable to the good to be exported shall be completed and signed by the producer of the good and given voluntarily to the exporter. The statement shall remain valid for up t o two years after it is signed. 5. Each Party shall provide that a Certificate of Origin that has been completed and signed by an exporter in the territory of the other Party is applicable to: (a) a single importation of one or more goods; or (b) multiple importations of identical goods within a specified period, not exceeding 12 months, set out in the certificate by the exporter. Article 5-03 Obligations Regarding Importations 1. Each Party shall require an importer in its territory that claims preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party to: (a) make a written statement, based on a valid Certificate of Origin, that the good qualifies as an originating good; (b) have the certificate in its possession at the time the statement is made; WT/REG125/1 Page 40 (c) provide, on the request of that Party’s customs administration, a copy of the certificate; and (d) promptly make a corrected statement and pay any duties owing where the importer has reason to believe that a certificate on which a statement was based contains information that is not correct. If the importer complies with the above obligation, it shall not be subject t o penalties. 2. Each Party shall provide that when an importer in its territory fails to comply with any of the requirements established in this Chapter it shall be denied the preferential tariff treatment claimed for the good imported into the territory of the other Party. 3. Each Party shall provide that, where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the territory of that Party but no claim for preferential tariff treatment was made at that time, the importer of the good may, no later than one year after the date on which the good was imported, apply for a refund of any excess duties paid as the result of the good not having been accorded preferential tariff treatment, on presentation of: (a) a written statement that the good qualified as an originating good at the time of importation; (b) a copy of the Certificate of Origin; and (c) such other documentation relating to the importation of the good as that Party may require. Article 5-04 Obligations Regarding Exportations 1 Each Party shall provide that an exporter or a producer in its territory that has completed and signed a certificate or declaration of origin, shall provide a copy of the certificate or declaration to its customs administration on request. 2. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or a producer in its territory that has completed and signed a certificate or declaration of origin, and that has reason to believe that the certificate contains information that is not correct, shall promptly notify in writing all persons to whom the certificate or declaration was given of any change that could affect the accuracy or validity of the certificate or declaration and its customs administration. In such cases, the exporter or producer shall not be subject to penalties for having presented an incorrect certificate or declaration. 3. Each Party shall provide that a false certification or statement by an exporter or a producer in its territory that a good to be exported to the territory of the other Party qualifies as an originating good shall have the same legal consequences, with appropriate modifications, as would apply to an importer in its territory for a contravention of its customs laws and regulations regarding the making of a false WT/REG125/1 Page 41 statement or representation. Each party may apply such measures as the circumstances may warrant where an exporter or a producer in its territory fails t o comply with any requirement of this Chapter. 4. The customs administration of the exporting Party shall inform the customs administration of the importing Party in writing of the notification referred to in paragraph 2. Article 5-05 Exceptions Provided that an importation does not form part of two or more importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the certification requirements of Articles 5-02 and 5-03, the Parties shall not require a Certificate of Origin in the following cases: (a) a commercial importation of a good whose value does not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in the Party’s currency, or such higher amount as it may establish, except that it may require that the invoice accompanying the importation include a statement by the importer or exporter certifying that the good qualifies as an originating good; (b) a non-commercial importation of a good whose value does not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in the Party’s currency, or such higher amount as it may establish; or (c) an importation of a good for which the Party into whose territory the good is imported has waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin. Article 5-06 Accounting Records Each Party shall provide that: (a) an exporter or a producer in its territory that completes and signs a certificate or declaration of origin shall maintain, for a minimum of five years after the date on which the certificate or declaration was signed, all records and documents relating to the origin of a good, including records and documents associated with: (i) the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, the good that is exported from its territory, (ii) the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, all materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the good that is exported from its territory, and WT/REG125/1 Page 42 (iii) the production of the good in the form in which the good is exported from its territory; and (b) an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into the Party’s territory from the territory of the other Party shall maintain, for a minimum of five years after the date of importation of the good, the Certificate of Origin and all documentation relating t o the importation of the good, as the importing Party may require. Article 5-07 Origin Verifications 1. The importing Party may request information from the exporting Party on the origin of a good. 2. For purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party under preferential tariff treatment qualifies as an originating good, a Party may, through its customs administration, conduct a verification solely by means of: (a) written questionnaires to exporters or producers in the territory of the other Party; (b) visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party to review the records and documents accrediting compliance with the rules of origin in accordance with Article 5-06 (a) and observe the facilities used in the production of the materials; or (c) such other procedure as the Parties may agree. 3. Prior to conducting a verification visit pursuant to paragraph (2)(b), the importing Party shall, through its customs administration, deliver a written notification of its intention to conduct the visit. The notification shall be sent to the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited, to the customs administration of the Party in whose territory the visit is to be conducted and, if requested by the latter, to the embassy of the other Party in the territory of the importing Party. The customs administration of the importing Party shall obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited. 4. The notification referred to in paragraph 3 shall include: (a) the identity of the customs administration issuing the notification; (b) the name of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited; (c) the date and place of the proposed verification visit; WT/REG125/1 Page 43 (d) the object and scope of the proposed verification visit, including specific reference to the good that is the subject of the verification; (e) the names, identification and titles of the officials performing the verification visit; and (f) the legal authority for the verification visit. 5. Where an exporter or a producer has not given its written consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 days of receipt of notification pursuant t o paragraph 3, the notifying Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that would have been the subject of the visit. 6. Each Party shall provide that, where its customs administration receives notification pursuant to paragraph 3, the customs administration may, within 15 days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 days from the date of such receipt, or for such longer period as the Parties may agree. 7. A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good based solely on the postponement of a verification visit pursuant to paragraph 6. 8. Each Party shall permit an exporter or a producer whose good is the subject of a verification visit to designate two observers to be present during the visit, provided that the observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers. The failure of the exporter or producer to designate observers shall not result in the postponement of the visit. 9. Each Party shall, through its customs administration, where conducting a verification of origin involving a regional value content, de minimis calculation or any other provision in Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) to which Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may be relevant, apply such principles as are applicable in the territory of the Party from which the good was exported. 10. After the verification visit, the customs administration shall provide the exporter or producer whose good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, including findings of fact and the legal basis for the determination. 11. Where a verification by a Party establishes that an exporter or a producer has made a false or unsupported certification or declaration on more than one occasion that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the importing Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin). 12. Each Party shall provide that where its customs administration determines that a good imported into its territory does not qualify as an originating good based on a tariff classification or a value applied by the Party to one or more materials used in the production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or value WT/REG125/1 Page 44 applied to the materials by the Party from whose territory the good was exported, the importing Party’s determination shall not become effective until it notifies in writing both the importer of the good and the person that completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the good of its determination. 13. A Party shall not apply a determination made under paragraph 12 to an importation made before the effective date of the determination where: (a) the customs administration of the exporting Party has issued an advance ruling under Article 5-09 or any other ruling on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, on which a person is entitled to rely; and (b) such rulings were given prior to notification of the verification of origin. Article 5-08 Confidentiality 1. Each Party shall maintain, in accordance with its law, the confidentiality of confidential information collected pursuant to this Chapter and shall protect that information from disclosure that could prejudice the person providing the information. 2. The confidential information collected pursuant to this Chapter may only be disclosed to those authorities responsible for the administration and enforcement of determinations of origin and of customs and revenue matters, as appropriate. Article 5-09 Advance Rulings 1. Each Party shall, through its customs administration, provide for the expeditious issuance of written advance rulings, prior to the importation of a good into its territory. The advance rulings shall be issued by the customs administration of the territory of the importing Party to an importer in its territory or an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party, on the basis of the facts and circumstances presented by them, concerning: (a) whether a good qualifies as an originating good under Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin); (b) whether non-originating materials used in the production of a good undergo a change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4-03 (Specific Rules of Origin); (c) whether a good satisfies a regional value-content established in Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin); WT/REG125/1 Page 45 (d) whether the method applied by an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party, in accordance with the principles of the Customs Valuation Code, for calculating the transaction value of the good or of the materials used in the production of the good for which an advance ruling is requested is suitable for determining whether the good complies with the regional value content under Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin); (e) whether the method applied by an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party for reasonably allocating costs, in accordance with the methods set out in the Uniform Regulations for calculating the net cost of the good or the value of an intermediate material, is suitable for determining whether the good complies with the regional value content under the Chapter referred to; (f) whether a good that re-enters its territory after the good has been exported from its territory to the territory of the other Party for repair or alteration qualifies for duty-free treatment in accordance with Article 3-08 (Goods Re-Entered after Repair or Alteration); and (g) such other matters as the Parties may agree. 2. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures for the issuance of advance rulings, including: (a) the information reasonably required to process an application for a ruling; (b) the authority of its customs administration, at any time during the course of an evaluation of an application, to request supplemental information from the person requesting the ruling; (c) the obligation of its customs administration to issue an advance ruling, after it has obtained all necessary information from the person requesting an advance ruling; and (d) the obligation of its customs administration to provide a full explanation of the reasons for the advance ruling. 3. Each Party shall apply an advance ruling to importations into its territory beginning on the date of its issuance or such later date as may be specified in the ruling, unless the advance ruling is modified or revoked under paragraph 5. 4. Each Party shall provide to any person requesting an advance ruling the same treatment, including the same interpretation and application of provisions of Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) regarding a determination of origin, as it provided to any other person to whom it issued an advance ruling, provided that the facts and circumstances are identical in all material respects. 5. An advanced ruling may be modified or revoked in the following cases: WT/REG125/1 Page 46 (a) if the ruling is based on an error: (i) of fact, (ii) in the tariff classification of a good or a material that is the subject of the ruling, (iii) in the application of a regional value-content requirement under Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), or (iv) in the application of the rules for determining whether a good that re-enters its territory after the good has been exported from its territory to the territory of the other Party for repair or alteration qualifies for duty-free treatment under Article 3- 08 (Goods Re-Entered after Repair or Alteration); (b) if the ruling is not in accordance with an interpretation agreed by the Parties regarding Chapter 3 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods) or Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin); (c) if there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based; (d) to conform with a modification of Chapter 3 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods), Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), this Chapter or the Uniform Regulations; or (e) to conform with an administrative or judicial decision or a change in the domestic law of the Party that issued the advance ruling. 6. Each Party shall provide that any modification or revocation of an advance ruling shall be effective on the date on which it is issued, or on such later date as may be specified therein, and shall not be applied to importations of a good that have occurred prior to that date, unless the person to whom the advance ruling was issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and conditions. 7. Each Party shall provide that where its customs administration examines the regional value content of a good for which it has issued an advance ruling , it shall evaluate whether: (a) the exporter or producer has complied with the terms and conditions of the advance ruling; (b) the exporter’s or producer’s operations are consistent with the material facts and circumstances on which the advance ruling is based; and WT/REG125/1 Page 47 (c) the data and computations used in applying the basis or method for calculating value or allocating cost were correct in all material respects. 8. Each Party shall provide that where its customs administration determines that any requirement in paragraph 7 has not been satisfied, the customs administration may modify or revoke the advance ruling as the circumstances may warrant. 9. Each Party shall provide that where its customs administration determines that an advance ruling was based on incorrect information, the person to whom i t was issued shall not be subject to penalties provided the person demonstrates that it used reasonable care and acted in good faith in presenting the facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based. 10. Each Party shall provide that where an advance ruling is issued to a person that has misrepresented or omitted material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based or has failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ruling, the customs administration that issued the ruling may apply such measures as the circumstances may warrant. 11. The Parties shall provide that the person to whom an advance ruling has been issued shall only use it for as long as the facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based continue. Should they no longer apply, the person to whom the advance ruling was issued may present information to enable the administration that issued the ruling to proceed under paragraph 5. 12. No good subject to a verification of origin or to a review or appeal body in the territory of either of the Parties shall be the subject of an advance ruling. Article 5-10 Penalties 1. Each Party shall establish or maintain measures imposing criminal, civil or administrative penalties for violations of its laws and regulations relating to this Chapter. 2. Nothing in Article 5-03(1)(d), 5-03(2), 5-04(2) or 5-07(7) shall be construed to prevent a Party from applying such measures as the circumstances may warrant. Article 5-11 Review and Appeal 1. Each Party shall grant the same rights of review and appeal of determinations of origin and advance rulings as it provides to its importers to exporters or producers in the other Party: WT/REG125/1 Page 48 (a) who complete and sign a certificate or declaration of origin for a good that has been the subject of a determination of origin pursuant t o Article 5-07(10); or (b) who has received an advance ruling pursuant to Article 5-09. 2. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 shall include access to at least one level of administrative review independent of the official or office responsible for the determination or advance ruling under review, and access to a judicial or quasi-judicial review of the determination or decision taken at the final level of administrative review, in accordance with its domestic law. Article 5-12 Uniform Regulations 1. The Parties shall establish, and implement through their respective laws and regulations by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and at any time thereafter, upon express agreement of the Parties, Uniform Regulations regarding the interpretation, application and administration of Chapter 3 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods), Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) and other matters as may be agreed by the Parties. 2. Each Party shall implement any modification of or addition to the Uniform Regulations no later than 180 days after the Parties agree on such modification or addition, or such other period as the Parties may agree. Article 5-13 Cooperation 1. Each Party shall notify the other Party of the following determinations, measures and rulings, including to the greatest extent practicable those that are prospective in application: (a) a determination of origin issued as the result of a verification conducted pursuant to Article 5-07, after the avenues for review and appeal mentioned in Article 5-11 have been exhausted; (b) a determination of origin that the Party considers to be contrary to a ruling issued by the customs administration of the other Party with respect to the tariff classification or value of a good, or of materials used in the production of a good, or the reasonable allocation of costs where calculating the net cost of a good, that is the subject of a determination of origin; (c) a measure establishing or significantly modifying an administrative policy that is likely to affect future determinations of origin; and WT/REG125/1 Page 49 (d) an advance ruling, or a ruling modifying an advance ruling, pursuant t o Article 5-09. 2. The Parties shall cooperate: (a) in the enforcement of their respective customs-related laws or regulations implementing this Agreement, and under any customs mutual assistance agreement or other customs-related agreement t o which they are party; (b) to the extent practicable and for purposes of facilitating the flow of trade between them, in such customs-related matters as the collection and exchange of statistics regarding the importation and exportation of goods, the harmonization of documentation used in trade, the standardization of data elements, the acceptance of an international data syntax and the exchange of information; (c) to the extent practicable, in the storage and transmission of customsrelated documentation; (d) to the extent practicable, in the verification of origin of a good, for which purpose the customs administration of the importing Party may request the customs administration of the other Party to carry out determined operations or measures for that purpose in its territory and to issue the respective reports; and (e) in seeking mechanisms for the detection and prevention of unlawful transhipments of goods from a non-Party. Article 5-14 Customs Sub-Committee 1. Notwithstanding Article 3-16 (Committee on Trade in Goods), The Customs Sub-Committee shall have the following functions: (a) endeavour to agree on: (i) tariff classification and valuation matters relating t o determinations of origin, (ii) equivalent procedures and criteria for the request, approval, modification, revocation and implementation of advance rulings, (iii) the revisions to the certificate or declaration of origin mentioned in Article 5-02, WT/REG125/1 Page 50 (iv) the interpretation, application and uniform administration of Article 3-06 (Temporary Admission of Goods), 3-07 (DutyFree Entry of Certain Commercial Samples and Printed Advertising Materials) and 3-08 (Goods Re-Entered after Repair or Alteration), Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), this Chapter and the Uniform Regulations, and (v) any other customs-related matter arising under this Agreement; (b) propose to the Committee on Trade in Goods modifications or additions to Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), this Chapter, the Uniform Regulations and customs-related matters in its sphere of competence; and (c) examine proposals for administrative or operational modifications in customs-related matters that could affect trade flows between the Parties. 2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from issuing a determination of origin or an advance ruling or from taking such other action as i t considers necessary, pending a resolution of a matter submitted to this SubCommittee for consideration. CHAPTER 6 – EMERGENCY ACTION Article 6-01 Definitions For the purposes of this Chapter: Agreement on Safeguards means the Agreement on Safeguards of the WTO Agreement; competent investigating authority means “competent investigating authority” as defined in Annex 6-01; contribute importantly means an important cause, but not necessarily the most important cause; critical circumstances means circumstances where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to repair; domestic industry means the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive good operating in the territory of a Party; emergency action does not include any emergency action pursuant to a proceeding instituted prior to the entry into force of this Agreement; WT/REG125/1 Page 51 serious injury, threat of and causal relationship means that the provisions in that regard established in the Agreement on Safeguards will be applied; surge means a significant increase in imports over the trend for a recent representative base period; and transition period means the period during which a good is in the process of tariff elimination. Article 6-02 Bilateral Emergency Actions 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 through 4, and during the transition period only, if a good originating in the territory of a Party, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this Agreement, is being imported into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities, in relation to domestic production, and under such conditions that the imports of the good from that Party alone constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the Party into whose territory the good is being imported may, to the minimum extent necessary to remedy or prevent the injury or threat thereof: (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty provided for under this Agreement on the good; (b) increase the rate of duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of (i) the most-favoured-nation applied rate of duty in effect at the time the action is taken, and (ii) the most favoured nation applied rate of duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 2. The following conditions and limitations shall apply to a proceeding that may result in emergency action under paragraph 1: (a) a Party shall, without delay, deliver to the other Party written notice of the institution of a proceeding that could result in emergency action against a good originating in the territory of the other Party; (b) any such action shall be initiated no later than one calendar year after the date of institution of the proceeding; (c) no action may be maintained (i) for a period exceeding one year, or WT/REG125/1 Page 52 (ii) beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the consent of the Party against whose good the action is taken; (d) no action may be taken by a Party against any particular good originating in the territory of the other Party more than once during the transition period; and (e) on the termination of the action, the rate of duty shall be the rate that, according to the Party’s Schedule to Annex 3-04(3) (Tariff Reduction Programme) for the staged elimination of the tariff, would have been in effect one year after the initiation of the action, and beginning January 1 of the year following the termination of the action, at the option of the Party that has taken the action (i) the rate of duty shall conform to the applicable rate set out in its Schedule to Annex 3-04(3), or (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual stages ending on the date set out in its Schedule to Annex 3-04(3) (Tariff Reduction Programme). 3. A Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the expiration of the transition period to deal with cases of serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry arising from the operation of this Agreement only with the consent of the other Party. 4. The Party taking an action under this Article shall provide to the other Party mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the action. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose good the action is taken may take tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken under this Article. The Party taking the tariff action shall apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects. Article 6-03 Global Emergency Actions 1. Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards, except those regarding compensation or retaliation and exclusion from an action to the extent that such rights or obligations are inconsistent with this Article. Any Party taking an emergency action under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards shall exclude imports of a good from the other Party from the action unless: (a) imports from the other Party account for a substantial share of total imports; and WT/REG125/1 Page 53 (b) imports from the other Party contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by total imports. 2. In determining whether: (a) imports from the other Party account for a substantial share of total imports, those imports normally shall not be considered to be substantial if that Party is not among the top five suppliers of the good subject to the proceeding, measured in terms of import share during the most recent three-year period; and (b) imports from the other Party contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, the competent investigating authority shall consider such factors as the change in the total import share of the other Party, and the level and change in the level of imports of the other Party. Imports from a Party normally shall not be deemed t o contribute importantly to serious injury, or the threat thereof, if the growth rate of such imports during the period in which the injurious surge in imports occurred is appreciably lower than the growth rate of total imports from all sources over the same period. 3. A Party taking such action, from which a good from the other Party is initially excluded pursuant to paragraph 1, shall have the right subsequently to include that good in the action in the event that the competent investigating authority determines that a surge in imports of such good undermines the effectiveness of the action. 4. A Party shall, without delay, deliver written notice to the other Party of the institution of a proceeding that may result in emergency action under paragraph 1 or 3. 5. Neither Party may impose restrictions on a good in an action under paragraph 1 or 3: (a) without delivery of prior written notice to the Commission, and without adequate opportunity for consultation with the other Party, as far in advance of taking the action as practicable; and (b) that would have the effect of reducing imports of such good from the other Party below the trend of imports of the good over a recent representative base period with allowance for reasonable growth. 6. A Party taking global emergency action pursuant to this Article against goods originating in the other Party shall limit that action solely and exclusively t o tariff measures. 7. The measures mentioned in paragraph 6 shall consist of increasing the rate of duty on the originating good to a level not to exceed the lesser of: WT/REG125/1 Page 54 (a) the most-favoured-nation applied rate of duty in effect at the time the action is taken; and (b) the most favoured nation applied rate of duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 8. The Party taking an action pursuant to this Article shall provide to the other Party mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the action. 9. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose good the action is taken may take action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken under paragraph 1 or 3. Article 6-04 Administration of Emergency Action Proceedings 1. Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and reasonable administration of its laws, regulations, decisions and rulings governing all emergency action proceedings. 2. Each Party shall entrust determinations of serious injury, or threat thereof, in emergency action proceedings to a competent investigating authority, subject t o review by judicial or administrative tribunals, to the extent provided by domestic law. Negative injury determinations shall not be subject to modification, except by such review. The competent investigating authority empowered under domestic law t o conduct such proceedings shall be provided with the necessary resources to enable i t to fulfil its duties. 3. Each Party shall adopt or maintain equitable, timely, transparent and effective procedures for emergency action proceedings, in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex 6-04. Article 6-05 Dispute Settlement in Emergency Action Matters Neither Party may request the establishment of an arbitral panel under Article 18-06 (Request for an Arbitral Panel) regarding any emergency action that has simply been proposed. WT/REG125/1 Page 55 PART THREE – TECHNICAL STANDARDS CHAPTER 7: SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES Article 7-01 Definitions For the purposes of this Chapter, the Parties shall use the definitions and terms established: (a) in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the WTO Agreement (Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures); (b) by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE); (c) in the International Convention on Phytosanitary Protection; and (d) by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Article 7-02 General Provisions 1. This Chapter applies to the principles, rules and procedures relating to the sanitary and phytosanitary measures which regulate or which may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in agricultural, fish and forest products between the Parties and other trade in plants and animals, their products and byproducts. 2. Through mutual cooperation, the Parties shall facilitate trade in agricultural, fish and forest products that present no sanitary or phytosanitary risks and undertake to prevent the introduction or spread of pests or diseases and to improve plant and animal health and food safety. 3. The competent authorities shall be the authorities with legal responsibility for enforcing compliance with the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements established in this Chapter. 4. The Parties revoke the document mentioned in Annex 7-02. WT/REG125/1 Page 56 Article 7-03 Rights of the Parties The Parties may: (a) adopt, maintain or apply any sanitary or phytosanitary measure in their territory only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, in accordance with this Chapter; (b) apply their sanitary and phytosanitary measures only to the extent necessary to achieve an appropriate level of protection, taking into account technical and economic feasibility; and (c) verify that plants, animals and plant and animal products for export are subject to strict sanitary and phytosanitary monitoring, certifying compliance with the requirements of the importing Party. Article 7-04 Obligations of the Parties 1. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall not constitute a disguised restriction on trade or create unnecessary obstacles to trade between the Parties. 2. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall be based on scientific principles, be maintained only where there are sufficient grounds and be based on an appropriate risk assessment. 3. Where identical or similar conditions exist, a sanitary or phytosanitary measure shall not discriminate arbitrarily or unjustifiably between its goods and similar goods of the other Party or between the goods of the other Party and similar goods of a non-Party. 4. The Parties shall provide the necessary facilities to verify control, inspection and approval procedures and sanitary and phytosanitary programmes. Article 7-05 International Standards and Harmonization 1. Each Party shall use international standards, guidelines or recommendations as the basis for its sanitary and phytosanitary measures, in order to harmonize them or make them compatible with those of the other Party. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Parties may adopt a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that offers a level of protection different from that which would be achieved by measures based on an international standard, guideline or recommendation, or which is higher, if there is scientific justification. WT/REG125/1 Page 57 3. To achieve closer harmonization, the Parties shall follow the guidelines of the competent international organizations: the International Convention on Phytosanitary Protection for plant health; the OIE for animal health; and the standards of the Codex Alimentarius Commission with respect to food safety and tolerance limits. 4. The parties shall also take into consideration the standards and guidelines of other international organizations of which they are members. 5. The Parties shall establish sanitary and phytosanitary harmonization systems for sampling, diagnosis, inspection and certification of animals, plants, their products and byproducts and food safety. Article 7-06 Equivalence 1. Without reducing the appropriate level of protection, the Parties shall accept to the fullest extent possible, their sanitary and phytosanitary measures as equivalent. 2. Each Party shall accept the sanitary and phytosanitary measures of the other Party as equivalent, even if they differ from its own, providing scientific information is furnished to demonstrate that they achieve the appropriate level of protection of the other Party. 3. To establish equivalencies between sanitary and phytosanitary measures, the Parties shall adopt reasonable procedures to facilitate access to their territory for the purposes of inspection, tests and other pertinent measures. Article 7-07 Assessment of Risk and Determination of the Appropriate Level of Sanitary or Phytosanitary Protection 1. The Parties shall ensure that their sanitary and phytosanitary measures are based on an adequate assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human and animal life and health and to the preservation of plant health and shall prevent harmful effects of the inputs used in protection and production, taking into account the guidelines and risk assessment techniques established by the competent international organizations. 2. On assessment of risk and determination of the appropriate level of protection, the Parties shall take account of the existence of specific diseases or pests; recognition of pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence, programmes for eradication or control, the structure and organization of sanitary and phytosanitary services, procedures for protection, surveillance, diagnoses and treatments to ensure the safety of the product. 3. In establishing their appropriate level of protection, the Parties shall take into account the objective of minimizing the negative effects on trade and, with the WT/REG125/1 Page 58 purpose of achieving consistency in protection levels, shall avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions that could lead to discrimination or which constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties. 4. Where a Party performs a risk assessment and concludes that the scientific information is insufficient, it may adopt a sanitary or phytosanitary measure on the basis of available information, including information from the competent international organizations as well as from sanitary or phytosanitary measures applied by the other Party. Once the necessary information becomes available, the Party shall conclude the assessment and, when warranted, shall proceed to modify the sanitary or phytosanitary measure. Article 7-08 Recognition of Pest- or Disease-Free Areas and Areas of Low Pest or Disease Prevalence 1. The Parties shall recognize pest- or disease-free areas and areas of low pest or disease prevalence on the basis of geographic location, ecosystems, epidemiological surveillance and the effectiveness of sanitary or phytosanitary controls in such areas, among the main factors. 2. A Party that declares an area in its territory to be free from a given pest or disease shall demonstrate that condition objectively to the satisfaction of the other Party and give it assurances that the area shall be maintained as such, based on the protection measures adopted by the heads of the sanitary or phytosanitary services. 3. A Party interested in obtaining recognition of an area that is free from a given pest or disease shall make application to the other Party and provide it with the corresponding scientific and technical information. 4. The Party receiving the application for recognition shall decide on it within a period agreed upon in advance with the other Party and may conduct verifications with respect to inspections, tests and other procedures. In the event it refuses the application, it shall give the technical grounds for its decision in writing. 5. The Parties shall agree on specific requirements whose compliance shall permit a good produced in an area of low pest or disease prevalence to be imported, if the appropriate level of protection is provided. Article 7-09 Control, Inspection and Approval Procedures Pursuant to this Chapter, the Parties shall apply the provisions of Annex C of the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures relating to control, inspection and approval procedures, including systems for approving the use of additives or for establishing tolerances for contaminants in foods, beverages or feedstuffs.

Article 8-02 General Provision Apart from the provisions of the TBT Agreement, the Parties shall apply the provisions of this Chapter. Article 8-03 Scope and Coverage 1. This Chapter applies to the standards-related measures of the Parties and measures that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods or services between them. WT/REG125/1 Page 63 2. This Chapter does not apply to sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which are covered by Chapter 7 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures). Article 8-04 Basic Rights and Obligations 1. Each Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, establish the levels of protection that it considers appropriate and may develop, adopt, apply or maintain any standards-related measure to ensure fulfilment of i ts legitimate objectives, and measures for the application of and compliance with standards-related measures, including approval procedures. 2. Each Party shall comply with this Chapter and adopt measures to ensure compliance and, within its ability, measures to that end with respect to nongovernmental standardization organizations that are duly accredited in its territory. 3. With respect to standards and technical regulations, each Party shall accord the goods and service providers of the other Party national treatment and treatment no less favourable than that it accords to similar goods and service providers of a non-Party country. 4. No Party may prepare, adopt, maintain or apply any standards-related measure with a view to or with the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle t o trade between the Parties. To that end, standards-related measures shall not restrict trade more than is necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, taking into account the risks that not fulfilling it would create. An unnecessary obstacle to trade shall not be deemed to be created where: (a) the demonstrable purpose of the measure is to achieve a legitimate objective; (b) it conforms to an international standard; and (c) the measure does not operate to exclude goods of the other Party that meet that legitimate objective. 5. Each Party shall use existing international standards or standards whose adoption is imminent as the basis for its own standards-related measures, unless such standards are not an effective or appropriate means of fulfilling its legitimate objectives. Article 8-05 Compatibility 1. Recognizing the central role of standards-related measures in achieving legitimate objectives, the Parties shall, in accordance with this Chapter and the TBT WT/REG125/1 Page 64 Agreement, work jointly to enhance the level of safety and of protection of human, animal and plant life and health, the environment and consumers. 2. Without reducing the level of safety or of protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the environment or consumers, without prejudice to the rights of either Party under this Chapter, and taking into account international standardization activities, the Parties shall, to the greatest extent practicable, make compatible their respective standards-related measures. 3. A Party shall, on request of the other Party, seek as far as practicable through appropriate measures, to promote the compatibility of a specific standard that is maintained in its territory with the standards maintained in the territory of the other Party. 4. On the express and written request of a Party, setting forth its reasons, the other Party shall give favourable consideration to the possibility of accepting technical regulations of that Party as equivalents, even if they differ from its own, provided that, in cooperation with that Party, it is convinced that the regulations comply with the legitimate objectives of its own regulations. 5. On the request of a Party, the other Party shall inform it in writing of its reasons for not accepting a technical regulation as equivalent. Article 8-06 Assessment of Risk 1. A Party may, in pursuing its legitimate objectives, conduct an assessment of risk. In conducting an assessment, a Party may take into account, among other factors relating to a good or service: (a) assessments of risks performed by international standardization organizations; (b) available scientific evidence or technical information; (c) intended end use; (d) processes or production methods provided they influence the nature of the end good or service; (e) operating, inspection, sampling or testing processes or methods; or (f) environmental conditions. 2. Where a Party establishes a level of protection that it considers appropriate to achieve its legitimate objectives and conducts an assessment of risk, it should avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions between similar goods or services in the level of protection it considers appropriate, where the distinctions: WT/REG125/1 Page 65 (a) result in arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against goods or service providers of the other Party; (b) constitute a disguised restriction on trade between the Parties; or (c) discriminate between similar goods or services for the same use under the same conditions that pose the same level of risk and provide similar benefits. 3. Where a Party conducting an assessment of risk determines that available scientific evidence or other information is insufficient to complete the assessment, i t may adopt a provisional technical regulation on the basis of available relevant information and in accordance with the TBT Agreement. The Party shall, within a reasonable period after information sufficient to complete the assessment of risk is presented to it, complete its assessment, review and, where appropriate, revise the provisional technical regulation in the light of that assessment. 4. A Party shall provide the other Party upon request with documentation on its risk-assessment processes and the factors it takes into account in conducting the assessment and in establishing the level of protection it considers appropriate in accordance with Article 8-04. Article 8-07 Conformity Assessment Procedures 1. Conformity assessment procedures shall be prepared, adopted and applied so as to grant access for goods and services originating in the territory of the other Party under conditions no less favourable than those accorded to suppliers of like good or service of the Party or of a non-Party in a comparable situation. 2. With respect to its conformity assessment procedures, each Party shall ensure that: (a) procedures are initiated and completed as expeditiously as possible, in non-discriminatory order; (b) the normal processing period for each such procedure is published or the anticipated processing period is communicated to the applicant upon request; (c) when receiving an application, the competent body or authority promptly examines the completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and complete manner of all deficiencies; the competent body transmits as soon as possible the results of the assessment in a precise and complete manner to the applicant so that corrective action may be taken if necessary; even when the application has deficiencies, the competent body proceeds as far as practicable with the conformity assessment if the applicant WT/REG125/1 Page 66 so requests; and that, upon request, the applicant is informed of the stage of the procedure, with any delay being explained; (d) information requirements are limited to what is necessary to assess conformity and determine fees; (e) the confidentiality of information about a good or service originating in the territory of the other Party arising from or supplied in connection with such conformity assessment procedures is respected in the same way as for a domestic good or service and in such a manner that legitimate commercial interests are protected; (f) any fees imposed for assessing the conformity of a good or service originating in the territory of the other Party are equitable in relation to any fees chargeable for assessing the conformity of like goods or services of national origin, taking into account communication, transportation and other costs arising from differences between the location of facilities of the applicant and the conformity assessment body; (g) the siting of facilities used in conformity assessment procedures and the selection of samples are not such as to cause unnecessary inconvenience to applicants or their agents; (h) whenever specifications of a good or service are changed subsequent to the determination of its conformity to the applicable technical regulations or standards, the conformity assessment procedure for the modified good or service is limited to what is necessary t o determine whether adequate confidence exists that the good or service still meets the technical regulations or standards concerned; and (i) a procedure exists to review complaints concerning the operation of a conformity assessment procedure and to take corrective action when a complaint is justified. 3. To facilitate trade, a Party shall give sympathetic consideration to a request by the other Party to negotiate agreements for the mutual recognition of the results of their respective conformity assessment procedures. 4. Each Party shall, as far as practicable, accept the results of conformity assessment procedures in the other Party, provided they offer satisfactory guarantees, equivalent to those provided by the procedures carried out by the accepting Party in its territory or which are carried out in its territory and whose results it accepts, that the pertinent good or service conforms to the applicable technical regulation or standard adopted or maintained in the territory of that Party. 5. Before accepting the results of a conformity assessment procedure, as provided in paragraph 4, and with the aim of enhancing the sustained reliability of the results of the conformity assessment of each Party, the Parties may consult on WT/REG125/1 Page 67 aspects such as the technical capacity of conformity assessment bodies, including verified conformity with relevant international standards through methods such as accreditation. 6. Recognizing that this should be to the mutual advantage of the Parties, each Party shall accredit, approve or otherwise recognize the conformity assessment bodies in the territory of the other Party under conditions no less favourable than i t accords to such bodies in its territory. Article 8-08 Approval Procedures Each Party shall apply the pertinent provisions of Article 8-07(2) to its approval procedures, with the appropriate modifications. Article 8-09 Notification, Publication and Transparency 1. A Party proposing to adopt or modify a technical regulation or a conformity assessment procedure applied to a technical regulation, except where the urgent circumstances established in Articles 2.10 and 5.7 of the TBT Agreement exist, shall publish a notice and notify the other Party in writing of the proposed measure at least 60 days prior to the adoption or modification of the measure, other than a law, as to enable interested persons to become acquainted with it. 2. Where a standardizing body of one Party proposes to adopt or modify a standard or conformity assessment procedure applied to a standard, that Party shall publish a notice and notify the other Party in writing of the proposed measure at an early appropriate stage, to enable interested persons to become acquainted with it. 3. The Parties shall make notifications under paragraphs 1 and 2 in accordance with the formats established in the TBT Agreement or such formats as are agreed t o by the Parties. 4. Each Party shall notify the other annually of its standardization plans and programmes. 5. Each Party shall keep a list of its standardization measures which, upon request, shall be made available to the other Party, and shall ensure that where copies of documents are requested by the other Party or by interested persons of that Party, they are supplied at the same price, apart from the actual cost of delivery, as the price for domestic purchase. 6. Where a Party allows non-governmental persons in its territory to be present during the process of development of standards-related measures, it shall also allow non-governmental persons from the territory of the other Party to be present. The non-governmental persons of the territory of the other Party shall be permitted t o WT/REG125/1 Page 68 express opinions and make comments on the standardization measure being developed. 7. For the purposes of this Article, the authorities named in Annex 8-09 shall be responsible for making the notifications.

Neither Party may impose or enforce any of the following requirements, or enforce any commitment or undertaking, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct or operation of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory: (a) to export a given level or percentage of goods or services; (b) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content; (c) to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced or services provided in its territory, or to purchase goods or services from persons in its territory; (d) to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with such investment; (e) to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that such investment produces or provides by relating such sales in any way t o the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings; WT/REG125/1 Page 76 (f) to transfer technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory, except when the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced by a court, administrative tribunal or competition authority to remedy an alleged violation of competition laws or to act in a manner not inconsistent with other provisions of this Agreement; or (g) to act as the exclusive supplier of the goods it produces or services i t provides to a specific region or world market. 2. A measure that requires an investment to use a technology to meet generally applicable health, safety or environmental requirements shall not be construed to be inconsistent with paragraph 1(f). For greater certainty, Articles 9-03 and 9-04 apply to the measure. 3. Neither Party may condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party or of a nonParty, on compliance with any of the following requirements: (a) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content; (b) to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from producers in its territory; (c) to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with such investment; or (d) to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that such investment produces or provides by relating such sales in any way t o the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings. 4.

Paragraphs 1 and 3 do not apply to any requirement other than the requirements set out in those paragraphs. 6. Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustifiable manner, or do not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in paragraph 1(b) or (c) or 3(a) or (b) shall be construed t o prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures, including environmental measures: (a) necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement; WT/REG125/1 Page 77 (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; or (c) necessary for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources. 7. This Article does not preclude enforcement of any commitment, undertaking or requirement between private parties. Article 9-08 Senior Management and Boards of Directors 1. Neither Party may require that an enterprise of that Party that is an investment of an investor of the other Party appoint to senior management positions individuals of any particular nationality. 2. A Party may require that a majority of the board of directors, or any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is an investment of an investor of the other Party, be of a particular nationality, or resident in the territory of the Party, provided that the requirement does not materially impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its investment. Article 9-09 Reservations and Exceptions 1. Articles 9-03, 9-04, 9-07 and 9-08 do not apply to: (a) any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by: (i) a Party at the national or federal or state level, as pertinent, as set out in its Schedule to Annex I or III, or (ii) a local government; (b) the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); or (c) an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with Articles 9-03, 9-04, 9-07 and 9-08. 2. Articles 9-03, 9-04, 9-07 and 9-08 do not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, subsectors or activities, as set out in its Schedule to Annex II. 3. Neither Party may, under any measure adopted after the date of entry into force of this Agreement and covered by its Schedule to Annex II, require an investor WT/REG125/1 Page 78 of the other Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment existing at the time the measure becomes effective. 4. Articles 9-03 and 9-04 do not apply to any measure that is an exception to, or derogation from, a Party’s obligations under the TRIPS Agreement, as specifically provided for in that agreement. 5. Article 9-04 does not apply to treatment accorded by a Party pursuant t o agreements, or with respect to sectors, set out in its Schedule to Annex IV. 6.

Article 9-10 Transfers 1. Except as provided in Annex 9-10, each Party shall permit all transfers relating to an investment of an investor of the other Party in the territory of the Party to be made freely and without delay. Such transfers include: (a) profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management fees, technical assistance and other fees, returns in kind and other amounts derived from the investment; (b) proceeds from the sale of all or any part of the investment or from the partial or complete liquidation of the investment; (c) payments made under a contract entered into by the investor, or its investment, including payments made pursuant to a loan agreement; (d) payments made pursuant to Article 9-11; and WT/REG125/1 Page 79 (e) payments arising under Section C. 2. Each Party shall permit transfers to be made in a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. 3. Neither Party may require its investors to transfer, or penalize its investors that fail to transfer, the income, earnings, profits or other amounts derived from, or attributable to, investments in the territory of the other Party. 4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to: (a) bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors; (b) issuing, trading or dealing in securities; (c) criminal offences; (d) reports of transfers of currency or other monetary instruments; or (e) ensuring the satisfaction of judgements in adjudicatory proceedings. 5. Paragraph 3 shall not be construed to prevent a Party from imposing any measure through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to the matters set out in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of paragraph 4. 6. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may restrict transfers of returns in kind in circumstances where it could otherwise restrict such transfers under this Agreement, including as set out in paragraph 4. Article 9-11 Expropriation and Compensation 1. Neither Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate an investment of an investor of the other Party in its territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such an investment (“expropriation”), except: (a) for a public purpose; (b) on a non-discriminatory basis; (c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 9-06(1); and (d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 6. WT/REG125/1 Page 80 2. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (“date of expropriation”), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value. 3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and be fully realizable. 4. If payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until the date of actual payment. 5. If a Party elects to pay in a currency other than a G7 currency, the amount paid on the date of payment, if converted into a G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, shall be no less than if the amount of compensation owed on the date of expropriation had been converted into that G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, and interest had accrued at a commercially reasonable rate for that G7 currency from the date of expropriation until the date of payment. 6. On payment, compensation shall be freely transferable as provided in Article 9-10. 7. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licences granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. 8. For purposes of this Article and for greater certainty, a non-discriminatory measure of general application shall not be considered a measure tantamount to an expropriation of a debt security or loan covered by this Chapter solely on the ground that the measure imposes costs on the debtor that cause it to default on the debt. Article 9-12 Special Formalities and Information Requirements 1. Nothing in Article 9-03 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the establishment of investments by investors of the other Party, such as a requirement that investments be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that such formalities do not materially impair the protection afforded by the Party pursuant to this Chapter. 2. Notwithstanding Articles 9-03 or 9-04, a Party may require an investor of the other Party, or its investment in its territory, to provide routine information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes. The Party shall protect such business information that is confidential from any disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the investment. Nothing WT/REG125/1 Page 81 in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good faith application of its law. Article 9-13 Relation to Other Chapters 1. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. 2. A requirement by a Party that a service provider of the other Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition of providing a service into its territory does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to the provision of that cross-border service. This Chapter applies to that Party’s treatment of the posted bond or financial security. Article 9-14 Denial of Benefits 1. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of such investor if investors of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and the denying Party: (a) does not maintain diplomatic relations with the non-Party; or (b) adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise or to its investments. 2. Subject to prior notification and consultation in accordance with Articles 16- 04 (Notification and Provision of Information) and 18-04 (Consultations), a Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of such investors if investors of a nonParty own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is constituted or organized. Article 9-15 Environmental Measures 1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns. 2. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party WT/REG125/1 Page 82 should not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such measures as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor. If a Party considers that the other Party has offered such an encouragement, it may request consultations with the other Party and the two Parties shall consult with a view to avoiding any such encouragement. Section C - Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an Investor of the Other Party Article 9-16 Purpose Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under Chapter 18 (Dispute Settlement), this Section establishes a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that assures both equal treatment among investors of the Parties in accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and due process before an impartial tribunal.

An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor incurred loss or damage. WT/REG125/1 Page 83 Article 9-18 Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise 1.

An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise described in paragraph 1 if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise incurred loss or damage. 3. Where an investor makes a claim under this Article and the investor or a noncontrolling investor in the enterprise makes a claim under Article 9-17 arising out of the same events that gave rise to the claim under this Article, and two or more of the claims are submitted to arbitration under Article 9-21, the claims should be heard together by a Tribunal established under Article 9-27, unless the Tribunal finds that the interests of a disputing party would be prejudiced thereby. 4. An investment may not make a claim under this Section. Article 9-19 Settlement of a Claim through Consultation and Negotiation The disputing parties should first attempt to settle a claim through consultation or negotiation.

Where a claim is submitted under Article 9-17, the investor and the enterprise that is a juridical person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the investor shall have not submitted the same claim to a court or administrative tribunal of the disputing party. 3. Where a claim is submitted under Article 9-18, both the investor and the enterprise that is a juridical person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the investor, shall have not submitted the same claim to a court or administrative tribunal of the disputing Party. 4.

Article 9-25 Constitution of a Tribunal When a Party Fails to Appoint an Arbitrator or the Disputing Parties Are Unable to Agree on a Presiding Arbitrator 1. The Secretary-General shall serve as appointing authority for an arbitration under this Section. 2. If a Tribunal, other than a Tribunal established under Article 9-27, has not been constituted within 90 days from the date that a claim is submitted t o arbitration, the Secretary-General, on the request of either disputing party, shall appoint, in his discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed, except that the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with paragraph 3. 3. The Secretary-General shall appoint the presiding arbitrator from the roster of presiding arbitrators referred to in paragraph 4, provided that the presiding arbitrator shall not be a national of a Party. In the event that no such presiding arbitrator is available to serve, the Secretary-General shall appoint, from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, a presiding arbitrator who is not a national of either of the Parties. 4.

Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, administrative supervision or the application of other measures, that any State enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations under Chapter 9 (Investment) wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licences, approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges. 3. Each Party shall ensure that any State enterprise that it maintains or establishes accords non-discriminatory treatment in the sale of its goods or services to investments in the Party’s territory of investors of the other Party.

Article 15-03 Relation to Other Intellectual Property Agreements 1. No provision of this Chapter, relating to intellectual property rights, shall derogate from existing obligations that the Parties may have to each other under the Paris Convention, the Berne Convention, the Rome Convention and the Geneva Convention.

Article 15-06 Control of Abusive or Anticompetitive Practices or Conditions 1. The Parties agree that some licensing practices or conditions pertaining t o the intellectual property rights referred to in this Chapter which restrain competition may have adverse effects on trade and may impede the transfer and dissemination of technology. 2. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the Parties from specifying in their legislation licensing practices or conditions that may in particular cases constitute an abuse of intellectual property rights having an adverse effect on competition in the relevant market.

Each Party shall provide to authors and their successors in interest those rights enumerated in the Berne Convention in respect of works covered by paragraph 1. 3. Computer programmes, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention. 4. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations, shall be protected as such. Such protection shall not extend t o the data or material itself, or prejudice any copyright subsisting in that data or material. 5. In respect of at least computer programmes and cinematographic works, the Parties shall provide authors and their successors in title the right to authorize or t o prohibit the commercial rental to the public of originals or copies of their copyright works. A Party shall be excepted from this obligation in respect of cinematographic works unless such rental has led to widespread copying of such works which is materially impairing the exclusive right of reproduction conferred in that Party on authors and their successors in title. In respect of computer programmes, this obligation does not apply to rentals where the programme itself is not the essential object of the rental. Article 15-10 Performers 1. Each Party shall grant performers the rights referred to the Rome Convention. 2. Notwithstanding the above, where a performer has consented to the visual or audiovisual fixation of a performance, Article 7 of the Rome Convention shall cease to be applicable.

Article 15-13 Provision for Copyright and Related Rights 1. Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights, any person acquiring or holding economic rights: (a) may freely and separately transfer such rights on any terms; and (b) may exercise those rights in its own name and fully enjoy the benefits derived from those rights. 2. Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to copyright and related rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. Article 15-14 Term of Protection of Copyright and Related Rights 1. The term of protection of an author’s work shall last for life and for a minimum of 50 years after the author’s death. 2. Where the term of protection of a work is to be calculated on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than 50 years counted from the end of the calendar year of the authorized publication of the work or, failing WT/REG125/1 Page 122 such authorized publication, 50 years from the making of the work counted the end of the calendar year of making. 3.

Section C - Trademarks Article 15-15 Protection 1. A trademark consists of any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of another. Such signs may be registered as trademarks, particularly words, including personal names, letters, numerals, figurative elements, combinations of colours and any combination of signs. Where the signs are not intrinsically capable of distinguishing the relevant goods or services, each Party may make their registration contingent on the distinctive character they have acquired through use. A Party may require, as a condition for registration, that a sign be visually perceptible. 2. The Parties may refuse to register trademarks that are contrary to morality or decorum, reproduce national symbols or mislead the public. 3. The nature of the goods or services to which a trademark is to be applied shall in no case form an obstacle to the registration of the trademark. 4. Each Party shall publish a trademark either before it is registered or promptly after it is registered and shall afford a reasonable opportunity for petitions to cancel the registration. In addition, each Party may afford an opportunity for the registration of a trademark to be opposed. Article 15-16 Rights Conferred The owner of a registered trademark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third parties not having the owner’s consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs for goods or services which are identical or similar to those in respect of which the trademark is registered where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. The rights described above shall not prejudice any existing prior rights, nor shall they affect the possibility of the Parties making rights available on the basis of use. WT/REG125/1 Page 123 Article 15-17 Well-Known Trademarks 1. Each Party shall apply Article 6 bis of the Paris Convention to service marks. 2. A trademark shall be considered well known in a Party when a given sector of the public or of commercial circles in the Party knows the trademark as a consequence of commercial activities undertaken within or outside that Party by a person using the trademark in relation to its goods or services, and when the mark is known in the territory of the Party as a consequence of promotion or publicity of the mark. 3. Each Party shall, under its law, provide the means to deny or invalidate registration as a trademark of signs or figures that are identical or similar to a wellknown trademark to be applied to a good or service in any case in which use of the mark by the person applying for registration could cause confusion or the risk of association with the person mentioned in paragraph 2, or which takes unfair advantage of the prestige of the mark. This prohibition shall not apply when the applicant for registration is the person referred to in paragraph 2. 4. To demonstrate that a trademark is well known, all evidence admitted by the Party in which the intention is to show that it is well known may be used. Article 15-18 Exceptions The Parties may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owner of the trademark and of third parties. Article 15-19 Term of Protection Initial registration, and each renewal of registration of a trademark shall be for a term of no less than ten years counted from the date on which the application was filed or the date on which it was granted. The registration of a trademark shall be renewable indefinitely. Article 15-20 Requirement of Use 1. If use is required by a Party to maintain the registration of a trademark, the registration may be cancelled only after an uninterrupted period of at least three years of non-use, unless valid reasons based on the existence of obstacles to such use are shown by the trademark owner. Circumstances arising independently of the WT/REG125/1 Page 124 will of the owner of the trademark which constitute an obstacle to the use of the trademark, such as import restrictions on or other government requirements for goods or services protected by the trademark, shall be recognized as valid reasons for non-use. 2. When subject to the control of its owner, use of a trademark by another person shall be recognized as use of the trademark for the purpose of maintaining the registration. Article 15-21 Renewal of a Trademark Subject to Annex 15-21, if use is required by a Party to renew a trademark, registration shall not be renewed without evidence of use of the trademark in accordance with the law of each Party. Article 15-22 Other Requirements The use of a trademark in the course of trade shall not be unjustifiably encumbered by special requirements, such as use with another trademark, use in a special form or use in a manner detrimental to its capability to distinguish the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. Article 15-23 Licensing and Assignment Each Party may determine conditions on the licensing and assignment of trademarks, it being understood that the compulsory licensing of trademarks shall not be permitted and that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the right to assign the trademark with or without the transfer of the enterprise to which the trademark belongs. Section D – Designations of Origin Article 15-24 Designations of Origin 1. Designations of origin shall be governed by the provisions of Annex 15-24. 2. The provisions of Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement shall apply to the designations of origin set out in Annex 15-24. Section E – Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Article 15-25 WT/REG125/1 Page 125 Definitions For the purposes of this Section: counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark which is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in i ts essential aspects from such a trademark, and which thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; pirated copyright goods means any goods which are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and which are made directly or indirectly from an Article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation; and right holder includes federations and associations having legal standing t o assert such rights. Article 15-26 General Obligations 1. The Parties shall ensure that enforcement procedures as provided in this Section, regarding the intellectual property rights referred to in this Chapter, are available under their law so as to permit effective action to be taken against any act of infringement of such rights, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies which constitute an effective deterrent to further infringements. These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse. 2. Procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be fair and equitable. They shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays. 3. Decisions on the merits of a case shall preferably be in writing and state the reasons. They shall be made available at least to the parties to the proceeding without undue delay. Decisions shall be based only on evidence in respect of which parties were offered the opportunity to be heard. 4. Parties to a proceeding shall have an opportunity for review by a judicial authority of final administrative decisions and, subject to jurisdictional provisions in a Party’s law concerning the importance of a case, of at least the legal aspects of initial judicial decisions on the merits of a case. However, there shall be no obligation to provide an opportunity for review of acquittals in criminal cases. 5. It is understood that this Section does not create any obligation to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct WT/REG125/1 Page 126 from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of the Parties to enforce their law in general. Nothing in this Section creates any obligation with respect to the distribution of resources as between enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general. Civil and Administrative Procedure and Remedies Article 15-27 Fair and Equitable Procedures The Parties shall make available to right holders civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right covered by this Chapter. Defendants shall have the right to written notice which is timely and contains sufficient detail, including the basis of the claims. Parties shall be allowed t o be represented by independent legal counsel, and procedures shall not impose overly burdensome requirements concerning mandatory personal appearances. All parties t o such procedures shall be duly entitled to substantiate their claims and to present all relevant evidence. The procedure shall provide a means to identify and protect confidential information, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements. Article 15-28 Evidence 1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority, where a party has presented reasonably available evidence sufficient to support its claims and has specified evidence relevant to substantiation of its claims which lies in the control of the opposing party, to order that this evidence be produced by the opposing party, subject in appropriate cases to conditions which ensure the protection of confidential information. 2. In cases in which a party to a proceeding voluntarily and without good reason refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide necessary information within a reasonable period, or significantly impedes a procedure relating to an enforcement action, the Parties may accord judicial authorities the authority to make preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative, on the basis of the information presented to them, including the complaint or the allegation presented by the party adversely affected by the denial of access to information, subject to providing the parties an opportunity to be heard on the allegations or evidence. Article 15-29 Injunctions 1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, inter alia to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right, immediately after customs clearance of such goods. The Parties are not obliged to accord such authority in respect of protected subject matter acquired WT/REG125/1 Page 127 or ordered by a person prior to knowing or having reasonable grounds to know that dealing in such subject matter would entail the infringement of an intellectual property right. 2. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section and provided that the provisions of Sections B and C specifically addressing use by governments, or by third parties authorized by a government, without the authorization of the right holder are complied with, the Parties may limit the remedies available against such use to payment of adequate compensation to the right holder, based on the circumstances of each case and taking account of the economic value of the authorization. In other cases, the remedies under this Section shall apply or, where these remedies are inconsistent with domestic law, declaratory judgements and adequate compensation shall be available. Article 15-30 Damages 1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder’s damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person’s intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity. 2. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the infringer t o pay the right holder expenses, which may include appropriate attorney’s fees. In appropriate cases, the Parties may authorize the judicial authorities to order recovery of profits or payment of pre-established damages, or both, even where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity. Article 15-31 Other Remedies In order to create an effective deterrent to infringement, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that goods that they have found to be infringing be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm caused to the right holder, or, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements, destroyed. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order that materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the creation of the infringing goods be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements. In considering such requests, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the interests of third parties shall be taken into account. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit release of the goods into the channels of commerce. Article 15-32 WT/REG125/1 Page 128 Right of Information The Parties may provide that the judicial authorities shall have the authority, unless this would be out of proportion to the seriousness of the infringement, t o order the infringer to inform the right holder of the identity of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services and of their channels of distribution. Article 15-33 Indemnification of the Defendant 1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party at whose request measures were taken and who has abused enforcement procedures t o provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained adequate compensation for the injury suffered because of such abuse. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant expenses, which may include appropriate attorney’s fees. 2. In respect of the administration of any law pertaining to the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights, the Parties shall only exempt both public authorities and officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where actions are taken or intended in good faith in the course of the administration of that law. Article 15-34 Administrative Procedures To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, such procedures shall conform t o principles equivalent in substance to those set forth in Articles 15-27 to 15-33. Article 15-35 Provisional Measures 1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order prompt and effective provisional measures: (a) to prevent an infringement of any intellectual property right covered in this Chapter from occurring, and in particular to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of goods, including imported goods, immediately after customs clearance; and (b) to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the alleged infringement. 2. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to adopt provisional measures inaudita altera parte where appropriate, in particular where any delay is likely t o WT/REG125/1 Page 129 cause irreparable harm to the right holder, or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed. 3. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to require the applicant t o provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant is the right holder and that the applicant’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. 4. Where provisional measures have been adopted inaudita altera parte, the parties affected shall be given notice, without delay after the execution of the measures at the latest. A review, including a right to be heard, shall take place upon request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period after the notification of the measures, whether these measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed. 5. The applicant may be required to supply other information necessary for the identification of the goods concerned by the authority that will execute the provisional measures. 6. Without prejudice to paragraph 4, provisional measures taken on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall, upon request by the defendant, be revoked or otherwise cease to have effect, if proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case are not initiated within a reasonable period, to be determined by the judicial authority ordering the measures where a Party’s law so permits or, in the absence of such a determination, not to exceed 20 working days or 31 calendar days, whichever is longer. 7. Where the provisional measures are revoked or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement or threat of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, upon request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by these measures. 8. To the extent that any provisional measure can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set forth in this Article. Special Requirements Related to Border Measures Article 15-36 Suspension of Release by Customs Authorities 1. The Parties shall adopt procedures to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for suspecting that the importation of counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods may take place in contravention of the holder’s rights, to lodge an application in writing with competent authorities, administrative or judicial, for the WT/REG125/1 Page 130 suspension by the customs authorities of the release into free circulation of such goods. There shall be no obligation to apply such procedures to imports of goods put on the market in the other Party or in a non-Party country by or with the consent of the right holder, or to goods in transit. 2. The Parties may enable such an application to be made in respect of goods which involve other infringements of intellectual property rights, provided that the requirements of Articles 15-36 through 15-45 are met. The Parties may also provide for corresponding procedures concerning the suspension by the customs authorities of the release of infringing goods destined for exportation from their territories. Article 15-37 Application Any right holder initiating the procedures under Article 15-36 shall be required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder’s intellectual property right and to supply a sufficiently detailed description of the goods to make them readily recognizable by the customs authorities. The competent authorities shall inform the applicant within a reasonable period whether they have accepted the application and, where determined by the competent authorities, the period for which the customs authorities will take action. Article 15-38 Security or Equivalent Assurance The competent authorities shall have the authority to require an applicant t o provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. Article 15-39 Notice of Suspension The importer and the applicant shall be promptly notified of the suspension of the release of goods pursuant to Article 15-36. Article 15-40 Duration of Suspension If, within a period not exceeding 10 working days after the applicant has been served notice of the suspension, the customs authorities have not been informed that proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case have been initiated by a party other than the defendant, or that the duly empowered authority has taken provisional measures prolonging the suspension of the release of the goods, the goods shall be released, provided that all other conditions for importation or WT/REG125/1 Page 131 exportation have been complied with.
