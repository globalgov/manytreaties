inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the
relevant services or service suppliers.
ARTICLE 5
Reservations
1. Articles 3 (Market Access) and 4 (National Treatment) shall not apply to:
(a) any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party at:

1. Articles 3 (Market Access) and 4 (National Treatment) shall not apply to
measures maintained by a Party at the regional level until the first review of this

Annex 4-II to extend the coverage of Articles 3 (Market Access) and 4 (National
Treatment) to these measures. Following the first review, Articles 3 (Market Access)
and 4 (National Treatment) shall apply, at the regional level, unless the nonconforming measures maintained at the regional level are covered by the reservations
in Annexes 4-I and 4-II.
2. A Party shall enter into consultations at the request of the other Party with a
view to ensuring that modifications or additions incorporated into the reservations in
accordance with Article 6.1 are consistent with the overall balance of benefits under
the Agreement, and deciding whether any necessary adjustment in the commitments
of the Parties is required to preserve this balance. Article 7 (Modification or Addition
of Reservations) and Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement) shall not apply to any such
adjustments. The Parties shall not apply any measure affecting trade in services at the
regional level in such a manner as would improve their negotiating position and
leverage.

modify or add to its non-conforming measures as set out in Annex 4-I and add new

request of the other Party, it shall hold consultations with a view to reaching
agreement on any necessary adjustment required to maintain the overall balance of

mutually agreed.
ARTICLE 9
Transparency
1. Each Party shall publish promptly and, except in emergency situations, at the

which pertain to or affect the operation of this Chapter. International agreements
pertaining to or affecting trade in services to which a Party is a signatory shall also be
published.

information shall be made otherwise publicly available.
3. Each Party shall respond promptly to all requests by the other Party for
specific information on any of its measures of general application or international
agreements within the meaning of Article 9.1. Each Party shall also establish one or
more enquiry points to provide specific information to the other Party, upon request,
on all such matters.
ARTICLE 10

ARTICLE 11
Domestic Regulation
1. Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade
in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.
2. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or
procedures which provide for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate
remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services are open on a nondiscriminatory basis to service suppliers of the other Party. Where such procedures
are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision
concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective
and impartial review.
3. Article 11.2 shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals
or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the
nature of its legal system.
4. Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service, the competent
authorities of a Party shall promptly, after the submission of an application considered
complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision
concerning the application. At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities
of the Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of
the application.
5. With the objective of ensuring that domestic regulation, including measures
relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and
licensing requirements, do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, the
Parties shall jointly review the results of the negotiations on disciplines on these
measures, pursuant to Article VI.4 of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in
Services (GATS), with a view to their incorporation into this Agreement. The Parties
note that such disciplines aim to ensure that such requirements are inter alia:
(a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and
the ability to supply the service;
(b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the
service;
(c) in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on
the supply of the service.
6. Pending the incorporation of disciplines pursuant to Article 11.5, a Party
shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and technical standards that
nullify or impair its obligations under this Chapter in a manner which:
(a) does not comply with the criteria outlined in Articles 11.5(a), 11.5(b)
or 11.5(c); and 
51
(b) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the
obligations were undertaken.
7. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations under
Article 11.6, account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international
organisations4
 applied by that Party.
8. Pending the incorporation of disciplines pursuant to Article 11.5, each Party or
its competent authorities shall endeavour to:
(a) make publicly available:
(i) information on requirements and procedures to obtain, renew or
retain any licences or professional qualifications; and
(ii) information on technical standards;
(b) explain, on request, the policy rationale of a measure, particularly of a
new measure; and
(c) provide opportunity for comment, and give consideration to such
comments, before their adoption, when introducing measures which
significantly affect trade in services.
ARTICLE 12
Monopoly and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory
does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner
inconsistent with the Partyís obligations under Articles 3 (Market Access) and 4
(National Treatment).
2. Where a Partyís monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an
affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights
and which is subject to that Partyís obligations under Articles 3 (Market Access) and
4 (National Treatment), the Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its
monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such
commitments.
3. If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of the
other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, it may request the
other Party establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to provide specific
information concerning the relevant operations in its territory.
4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service

Payments and Transfers
 1. Subject to its reservations pursuant to Article 5 (Reservations) and except
under the circumstances envisaged in Article 15 (Restrictions to Safeguard the
Balance of Payments), a Party shall not apply restrictions on international transfers
and payments for current transactions.
2. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties as
members of the International Monetary Fund under the Articles of Agreement of the
Fund, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the Articles
of Agreement, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital
transactions inconsistently with its obligations under this Chapter regarding such
transactions, except under Article 15 (Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of
Payments) or at the request of the Fund.
ARTICLE 15
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments
1. In the event of serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties
or threat thereof, a Party may adopt or maintain restrictions on trade in services in
respect of which it has obligations under Articles 3 (Market Access) and 4 (National
Treatment), including on payments or transfers for transactions relating to such
obligations. It is recognized that particular pressures on the balance of payments of a
Party in the process of economic development may necessitate the use of restrictions
to ensure, inter alia, the maintenance of a level of financial reserves adequate for the
implementation of its programme of economic development.
2. The restrictions referred to in Article 15.1 shall:
(a) be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund; 
53
(b) avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and financial
interests of the other Party;
(c) not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances described in
Article 15.1;

in Article 15.1 improves;

consultations with the other Party in order to review the restrictions adopted by it.
ARTICLE 16
Government Procurement
Articles 3 (Market Access) and 4 (National Treatment) shall not apply to laws,
regulations or requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies of
services purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial
resale or with a view to use in the supply of services for commercial sale.
ARTICLE 17
Denial of Benefit
Subject to prior notification and consultation, a Party may deny the benefits of
this Chapter to a service supplier of the other Party where the Party establishes that
the service supplier is owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party and that it has no
substantive business operations in the territory of the other Party.
ARTICLE 18
General Exceptions
Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner
which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between
the Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade in services,
nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a
Party of measures: 
54
(a) necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order;5
(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;
(c) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter including those relating to:
(i) the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal
with the effects of a default on services contracts;
(ii) the protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the
processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of
confidentiality of individual records and accounts;
(iii) safety;
(d) inconsistent with Article 4 (National Treatment), provided that the
difference in treatment is aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective 6
imposition or collection of direct taxes in respect of services or service
suppliers of the other Party.

5
 The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is
posed to one of the fundamental interests of society.
6
 Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes
include measures taken by a Party under its taxation system which:
(i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of nonresidents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Partyís territory; or
(ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party's
territory; or
(iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes,
including compliance measures; or
(iv) apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of the other Party in order to
ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the Party's
territory; or
(v) distinguish service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other service
suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or
(vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident
persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard
the Party's tax base.
Tax terms or concepts in Article 18(d) and in this footnote are determined according to tax definitions
and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party
taking the measure. 
55
ARTICLE 19
Security Exceptions
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed:
(a) to require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it
considers contrary to its essential security interests; or
(b) to prevent a Party from taking any action which it considers necessary
for the protection of its essential security interests:
(i) relating to the supply of services as carried out directly or
indirectly for the purpose of provisioning a military establishment;
(ii) relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials
from which they are derived;

trade in services with a non-Party, it shall give positive consideration to a request by
the other Party for the incorporation herein of treatment no less favourable than that
provided under the aforesaid agreement. Any such incorporation should maintain the
overall balance of commitments undertaken by each Party under this Agreement.
2. If, after this Agreement enters into force, a Party further liberalizes any of its
non-conforming measures in Annex 4-I or sectors, subsectors, or activities in Annex
4-II unilaterally, it shall give positive consideration to a request by the other Party for
the incorporation herein of the unilateral liberalisation. Any such incorporation
should maintain the overall balance of commitments undertaken by each Party under
this Agreement.
3. If, after this Agreement enters into force, a service previously supplied in the
exercise of governmental authority is subsequently supplied on a commercial basis or
in competition with one or more service suppliers, the Party concerned may modify or
add to its reservations in respect of that service. At the request of the other Party, the
Party concerned shall enter into consultations with a view to ensuring the maintenance

of the overall balance of commitments undertaken by each Party under this
Agreement.

Provisions), or at any other time agreed between the Parties, with a view to including
these developments in this Agreement.
5. While both Parties affirm their rights and obligations under the Agreement
between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of
the Republic of Singapore relating to Air Services, signed on 3 November 1967 and
any subsequent amendments thereto, both Parties agree to work towards an Open
Skies Air Services Agreement and to review that work in accordance with the

Transitional Provision on Regional Government Measures
1. Articles 3 (National Treatment) shall not apply to measures maintained by a
Party at the regional level until the first review of this Agreement under Article 3
(Review) of Chapter 17 (Final Provisions), when modifications or additions may be
incorporated into the reservations in Annex 4-I and Annex 4-II to extend the coverage
of Article 3 (National Treatment) to these measures. Following the first review,
Article 3 (National Treatment) shall apply, at the regional level, unless the nonconforming measures maintained at the regional level are covered by the reservations
in Annexes 4-I and 4-II by a Party.
2. A Party shall enter into consultations at the request of the other Party with a
view to ensuring that modifications or additions incorporated into the reservations in
accordance with Article 6.1 are consistent with the overall balance of benefits under
the Agreement, and deciding whether any necessary adjustment in the commitments
of the Parties is required to preserve this balance. Article 7 (Modification or Addition
of Reservations) and Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement) shall not apply to any such
adjustments. The Parties shall not apply any measure affecting investment at the
regional level in such a manner as would improve their negotiating position and
leverage.
ARTICLE 7
Modification or Addition of Reservations

modify or add to its non-conforming measures as set out in Annex 4-I and add new

sectors, subsectors or activities to its reservations set out in Annex 4-II. At the request
of the other Party, it shall hold consultations with a view to reaching agreement on
any necessary adjustment required to maintain the overall balance of commitments
undertaken by each Party under this Agreement. If agreement is not reached between
the Parties on any necessary adjustment, the matter may be referred to arbitration in
accordance with Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement).
2. Article 7.1 shall not be construed to prejudice the right of both Parties to
maintain any existing measures or adopt any new measures consistent with the
reservations set out in Annexes 4-I and 4-II.
ARTICLE 8
Additional Commitments
1. The Parties shall set out their respective additional commitments in Annex 4-
III of this Agreement with respect to investment matters not covered by Article 3
(National Treatment).

ARTICLE 9
Expropriation and Nationalisation
1. Neither Party shall nationalise, expropriate or subject to measures having
effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
ìexpropriationî) the investments of investors of the other Party unless such a measure
is taken on a non-discriminatory basis, for a public purpose, in accordance with due
process of law, and upon payment of compensation in accordance with this Article.
2. The expropriation shall be accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate
and effective compensation. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value
of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation or impending
expropriation became public knowledge. Compensation shall carry an appropriate
interest, taking into account the length of time from the time of expropriation until the
time of payment. Such compensation shall be effectively realisable, freely transferable
in accordance with Article 11 (Transfers) and made without delay.
3. Notwithstanding Articles 9.1 and 9.2, any measure of expropriation relating to
land, which shall be as defined in the existing domestic legislation of the
expropriating Party on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, shall be for a
purpose and upon payment of compensation in accordance with the aforesaid
legislation and any subsequent amendments thereto relating to the amount of
compensation where such amendments follow the general trends in the market value
of the land. 
63
4. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in
relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of
intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or
creation is consistent with the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights and Chapter 13 (Intellectual Property).
ARTICLE 10
Compensation for Losses
A Party shall accord to investors of the other Party whose investments in the
territory of the former Party have suffered losses owing to war or other armed conflict
or civil strife in that territory, treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification,
compensation, or other settlement or measures it adopts or maintains relating to such
losses, no less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors and investors
of any non-Party.
ARTICLE 11
Transfers
1. Each Party shall permit, on a non-discriminatory basis, all funds of an investor
of the other Party related to an investment in its territory to be transferred freely and
without undue delay. Such funds include the following:

Party or any freely useable currency at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date of
transfer.

equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to:

transactions inconsistently with its obligations under this Chapter regarding such
transactions, except under Article 12 (Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of
Payments) or at the request of the Fund.
ARTICLE 12
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments
1. In the event of serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties
or threat thereof, a Party may adopt or maintain restrictions on payments or transfers
related to investments. It is recognized that particular pressures on the balance of
payments of a Party in the process of economic development may necessitate the use
of restrictions to ensure, inter alia, the maintenance of a level of financial reserves
adequate for the implementation of its programme of economic development.
2. The restrictions referred to in Article 12.1 shall:
(a) be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund;
(b) avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and financial
interests of the other Party;
(c) not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances described in
Article 12.1;
(d) be temporary and be phased out progressively as the situation specified
in Article 12.1 improves;
(e) be applied on a national treatment basis and such that the other Party is
treated no less favourably than any non-Party.

therein, shall be promptly notified to the other Party.

consultations with the other Party in order to review the restrictions adopted by it.

ARTICLE 13
Subrogation
1. If a Party or a designated agency of a Party makes a payment to any of its
investors under a guarantee, a contract of insurance or other form of indemnity it has
granted in respect of an investment of an investor of that Party, the other Party shall
recognise the subrogation or transfer of any right or title in respect of such investment.
The subrogated or transferred right or claim shall not be greater than the original right
or claim of the investor.
2. Where a Party or a designated agency of a Party has made a payment to an
investor of that Party and has taken over rights and claims of the investor, that
investor shall not, unless authorised to act on behalf of the Party or the designated
agency of the Party making the payment, pursue those rights and claims against the
other Party.
ARTICLE 14
Settlement of Disputes between a Party and an Investor of the other Party
1. This Article shall apply to disputes between a Party and an investor of the
other Party concerning an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under this
Chapter which causes loss or damage to the investor or its investment.
2. The parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by
consultations and negotiations.
3. Where the dispute cannot be resolved as provided for under Article 14.2
within 6 months from the date of a request for consultations and negotiations, then
unless the disputing investor and the disputing Party agree otherwise or either of them
has already submitted the dispute to the courts or administrative tribunals of the
disputing Party (excluding proceedings for interim measures of protection referred to
in Article 14.5), the dispute may be submitted by either party to the dispute to:
 (a) the courts or administrative tribunals of the disputing Party;
 (b) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)

on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States, done at Washington on 18 March 1965; or
 (c) arbitration under the rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of a dispute to conciliation or
arbitration under Articles 14.3(b) and 14.3(c) in accordance with the provisions of this
Article, conditional upon:
(a) the submission of the dispute to such conciliation or arbitration taking
place within three years of the time at which the disputing investor became
aware, or should reasonably have become aware, of a breach of an obligation
under this Chapter causing loss or damage to the investor or its investment;
and
(b) the disputing investor providing written notice, which shall be
submitted at least 30 days before the claim is submitted, to the disputing Party
of his or her intent to submit the dispute to such conciliation or arbitration and
which:
(i) nominates either Article 14.3(b) or Article 14.3(c) as the forum
for dispute settlement (and, in the case of Article 14.3(b),
nominates whether conciliation or arbitration is being sought);
(ii) waives its right to initiate or continue any proceedings
(excluding proceedings for interim measures of protection
referred to in Article 14.5) before any of the other dispute
settlement fora referred to in Article 14.3 in relation to the
matter under dispute; and

(iii) briefly summarises the alleged breach of the disputing Party
under this Chapter (including the articles alleged to have been
breached) and the loss or damage allegedly caused to the
investor or its investment.
5. Neither Party shall prevent the disputing investor from seeking interim
measures of protection, not involving the payment of damages or resolution of the
substance of the matter in dispute before the courts or administrative tribunals of the
disputing Party, prior to the institution of proceedings before any of the dispute
settlement fora referred to in Article 14.3, for the preservation of its rights and
interests.
6. Neither Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim,
in respect of a dispute which one of its investors and the other Party shall have
consented to submit or have submitted to conciliation or arbitration under this Article,
unless such other Party has failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in
such dispute. Diplomatic protection, for the purposes of this paragraph, shall not
include informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement
of the dispute.

non-conforming measures in Annex 4-I or sectors, subsectors or activities in Annex 4-

operations in the territory of the other Party.

construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures:
(a) necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order;1

Where such measures do not conform with the provisions of this Agreement, they
shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Partyís commitments or obligations
under this Agreement.

its own like financial service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.
Each Party shall endeavour to ensure that these measures are not more burdensome
than necessary to achieve their aim.

2. Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of public telecommunications
networks or services of the other Party aggrieved by a regulatory decision has the
opportunity to appeal such regulatory decision to an independent judicial or
administrative authority. Such an appeal shall not constitute grounds for noncompliance by that supplier with the regulatory decision unless an appropriate
authority stays such decision.
3. Each Party shall ensure that, in the hearing of appeals by an administrative
authority referred to in Article 6.2:5
(a) suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the
other Party which are party to the appeal have a fair and reasonable
opportunity to obtain sufficient information to enable them to form informed
views on the issues to be determined in the appeal and to provide these views
to the administrative authority;
(b) the administrative authority takes into account views provided by such
suppliers pursuant to Article 6.3(a); and
(c) the administrative authority makes available to such suppliers its
decision and an explanation of the reasons for its decision.
4. At the request of a supplier of public telecommunications networks or services
which is a party to an appeal referred to in Article 6.3, an administrative authority
may, where necessary to avoid causing prejudice to the legitimate commercial
interests of that supplier, impose reasonable limitations on the requirement to provide
the information referred to in Article 6.3(a) and Article 6.3(c) provided that such
limitations:
(a) are applied only to the extent necessary to protect such commercial
interests; and
(b) do not deprive suppliers of public telecommunications networks or
services of the other Party which are party to an appeal referred to in Article
6.3 of their right under Article 6.3(a) to provide their views to the
administrative authority.

 The maintenance of appropriate measures includes the effective enforcement of such measures.
7
 For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations imposed under this Article only apply with respect to
those public telecommunications networks or services, or parts thereof, that result in a supplier of
public telecommunications networks or services being a major supplier. 
82
(i) availability, provisioning, rates, 8 or quality of like public
telecommunications networks or services; and
(ii) availability of technical interfaces
where such suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services and
subsidiaries, affiliates and non-affiliates of the major supplier are in like

point, on an unbundled basis, in a timely fashion; and on terms, conditions,
and cost-oriented rates that are reasonable, transparent, and non-discriminatory.
(b) Each Party may determine, in accordance with its domestic laws and
regulations, which network elements it requires major suppliers in its territory
to provide access to in accordance with Article 9.3(a) on the basis of the

8 The costs incurred by a major supplier in supplying public telecommunications networks or services
to itself may be determined in accordance with any cost-oriented costing methodology considered
appropriate by a Party. Treatment that is no less favourable regarding rates for like public
telecommunications networks or services may take into account the legitimate transaction costs which
the major supplier incurs in supplying such public telecommunications networks or services to
suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party.
9
 The maintenance of appropriate measures includes the effective enforcement of such measures. 
83
technical feasibility of unbundling and the state of competition in the relevant
market.
4. Co-Location
(a) Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide to
facilities-based suppliers of the other Party physical co-location of equipment
necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements in a
timely fashion and on terms, conditions, and cost-oriented rates that are
reasonable, transparent, and non-discriminatory.
(b) Where physical co-location under Article 9.4(a) is not practical for
technical reasons or because of space limitations, each Party shall ensure that
major suppliers co-operate with facilities-based suppliers to find and
implement the most feasible alternative solution in a timely fashion and on
terms, conditions, and cost-oriented rates that are reasonable, transparent, and
non-discriminatory. Such solutions may include:
(i) permitting facilities-based suppliers to locate equipment in a

(iii) optimizing the use of existing space; or
(iv) finding adjacent space.

(a) Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide
interconnection to facilities-based suppliers of the other Party:
(i) at any technically feasible point in the major supplierís network;

standards and specifications) and rates;11
(ii) of a quality no less favourable than that provided by such major
supplier for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated
service suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;
(iv) in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical
standards and specifications) and cost-oriented rates 12 that are
transparent, reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and
sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network
components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be
provided; and
(v) upon request, at points in addition to the network termination
points offered to the majority of facilities-based suppliers, subject to
charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional
facilities.

10 Australia's interconnection regime provides access on terms and conditions which are fair and
reasonable to all parties and which do not unfairly discriminate between users. Access rights are
guaranteed by legislation and the terms and conditions of access are established primarily through
processes of commercial negotiation or by reference to access undertakings given by suppliers of
public telecommunications networks or services which may draw upon an industry code of practice.
Any code of practice and each supplier's undertaking will be subject to approval by the regulator.
11 In Australia, the rate at which interconnection is provided is determined by negotiation. Both
negotiating parties have recourse to the regulator which will make a decision based on transparent
criteria to ensure that rates are fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
12 The regulator may resolve any dispute on what costs are relevant in determining rates. 
85
(b) Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications
networks or services of the other Party may interconnect with major suppliers
in its territory pursuant to at least one of the following options:
(i) a publicly available reference interconnection offer;
(ii) any existing interconnection agreement between the major
supplier and any similarly situated supplier of public
telecommunications networks or services;
(iii) an individualised agreement between the major supplier and the
supplier of public telecommunications networks or services that seeks
to interconnect with it; or
(iv) binding arbitration.
(c) Each Party shall ensure that the applicable procedures for
interconnection negotiations with major suppliers in its territory are made
publicly available.
(d) Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory make
publicly available either their interconnection agreements or a reference
interconnection offer.
8. Resolution of Interconnection Disputes
(a) When facilities-based suppliers are unable to resolve disputes
regarding the terms, conditions and rates on which interconnection is to be
provided by a major supplier, they shall have recourse to the regulator, which
shall aim to resolve the disputes within 180 days of the referral to it, provided
that the resolution of complex disputes may take longer than 180 days.

(b) Where the regulator is unable to resolve the disputes referred to in
Article 9.8(a) within 180 days, each Party shall ensure that the regulator
endeavours to provide interim determinations on the disputes where necessary
to ensure that facilities-based suppliers of the other Party are able to
interconnect with a major supplier.
ARTICLE 10

its territory provide number portability, for those services designated by that Party, to
the extent technically feasible, on a timely basis and on reasonable terms and
conditions. 
86
ARTICLE 11
Access to Buildings13
Each Party shall ensure that facilities-based suppliers may install, maintain
and have access to their equipment in buildings or on land that the Party considers is

Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources14
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including
frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, timely,
transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency
bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies
allocated for specific government use shall not be required.
ARTICLE 13
Industry Participation

appropriate:
(a) facilitate the involvement of suppliers of public telecommunications
networks or services of the other Party operating in its territory in the
development of industry standards and, where it considers appropriate, in the
regulation of the telecommunications industry; and
(b) encourage suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services
of the other Party operating in its territory to provide feedback to regulators on
the regulation of the telecommunications industry.
ARTICLE 14
Enforcement

13 To the extent of any inconsistency between this Article and Article 9, the latter shall prevail.
14 Decisions on the allocation and assignment of spectrum and frequency management are not measures
that are per se inconsistent with Article 3 (Market Access) of Chapter 7 (Trade in Services). Accordingly,
each Party retains the ability to exercise its spectrum and frequency management policies, which may
affect the number of service suppliers, provided that this is done in a manner that is consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement. The Parties also retain the right to allocate frequency bands taking into
account existing and future needs. 
87
Each Party shall adopt or maintain timely, proportionate and effective
sanctions for the purpose of enforcing domestic measures relating to the obligations
contained in this Chapter. Such sanctions may include financial penalties, injunctions,
orders to cease and desist (on an interim or final basis), and/or the ability to suspend,
modify or revoke licences.

shall be kept confidential. Nothing in this Article shall preclude a Party from

information contained in its submissions that could be disclosed to the public.

Parties shall transmit to the arbitral tribunal written submissions in which they present
the facts of their case and their arguments.

and still at the same meeting, the Party against which the complaint has been brought
shall be asked to present its submission.

tribunal. The Party complained against shall have the right to present its submission
first, and shall be followed by the complaining Party. The Parties shall submit, prior
to the meeting, written rebuttals to the arbitral tribunal.

for explanations either in the course of a meeting with the Parties or in writing.
7. The Parties shall make available to the arbitral tribunal a written version of
their oral statements.
8. In the interests of full transparency, the presentations, rebuttals and statements
referred to in paragraphs 4 to 6 shall be made in the presence of the Parties. Moreover,
each Partyís written submissions, including any comments on the report, written
versions of oral statements and responses to questions put by the arbitral tribunal,
shall be made available to the other Party. There shall be no ex parte communications
with the arbitral tribunal concerning matters under consideration by it.
9. The arbitral tribunal shall have the right, in consultation with the Parties, to
seek information and technical advice from any individual or body which it deems
appropriate, and shall make any such information and technical advice available to the
Parties. A Party shall respond promptly and fully to any request by an arbitral
tribunal for such information as the arbitral tribunal considers necessary and
appropriate. 
112
10. The report of the arbitral tribunal shall be drafted without the presence of the
Parties in the light of the information provided and the statements made. The arbitral
tribunal shall accord adequate opportunity to the Parties to review the entirety of its
draft report prior to its finalisation and shall include a discussion of any comments by
the Parties in its final report.
11. The arbitral tribunal shall release to the Parties its final report on the dispute
referred to it within 60 days of its formation. When the arbitral tribunal considers that
it cannot release its final report within 60 days, it shall inform the Parties in writing of

issue its report. The final report of the arbitral tribunal shall become a public
document within 10 days after its release to the Parties.

establishment of the tribunal shall lapse unless the Parties agree otherwise.

established under this Agreement, in the event that a mutually satisfactory solution to
the dispute has been found.

proceedings propose to the Parties that the dispute be settled amicably.
ARTICLE 9
Implementation
1. The Party concerned shall comply with the arbitral tribunalís
recommendations within a reasonable period of time. The reasonable period of time
shall be mutually determined by the Parties or, where the Parties fail to agree on the
reasonable period of time within 45 days of the release of the arbitral tribunalís report,
either Party may refer the matter to the tribunal, which shall determine the reasonable
period of time following consultation with the Parties.
2. Where there is disagreement as to the existence or consistency with this
Agreement of measures taken within the reasonable period of time to comply with the
recommendations of the arbitral tribunal, such dispute shall be decided through
recourse to the dispute settlement procedures in this Chapter, including wherever
possible by resort to the original arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal shall provide
its report to the Parties within 60 days after the date of the referral of the matter to it.
When the arbitral tribunal considers that it cannot provide its report within this 
113
timeframe, it shall inform the Parties in writing of the reasons for the delay together
with an estimate of the period within which it will submit its report.
ARTICLE 10
Compensation and Suspension of Benefits
1. If the Party concerned fails to bring the measure found to be inconsistent with
the Agreement into compliance with the recommendations of the arbitral tribunal
under Article 9.2 within 20 days of the report of that arbitral tribunal being provided
to the Parties, that Party shall, if so requested, enter into negotiations with the
complaining Party with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement on any
necessary compensatory adjustment.
2. If no mutually satisfactory agreement on compensation has been reached
within 20 days after the request of the complaining Party to enter into negotiations on
compensatory adjustment, the complaining Party may request the original arbitral
tribunal to determine the appropriate level of any suspension of benefits conferred on
the other Party under this Agreement. Where the original arbitral tribunal cannot hear
the matter for any reason, a new tribunal shall be appointed under Article 4
(Appointment of Arbitral Tribunals).
3. Any suspension of benefits shall be restricted to benefits accruing to the other
Party under this Agreement.
4. In considering what benefits to suspend under Article 10.2:
(a) the Party having invoked the dispute settlement procedures should first
seek to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by the
measure or other matter that the arbitral tribunal has found to be inconsistent
with this Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment; and
(b) the Party having invoked the dispute settlement procedures may
suspend benefits in other sectors if it considers that it is not practicable or
effective to suspend benefits in the same sector.
5. The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall only be applied until
such time as the measure found to be inconsistent with this Agreement has been
removed, or the Party that must implement the arbitral tribunalís recommendations
has done so, or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.
ARTICLE 11
Expenses
Each Party shall bear the costs of its appointed arbitrator and its own expenses
and legal costs. The costs of the Chair of the arbitral tribunal and other expenses 
114
associated with the conduct of its proceedings shall be borne in equal parts by both
