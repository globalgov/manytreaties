ANNEX IV

SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES

Article 1. General Provisions

1. The Parties agree to act in accordance with the provisions of the SPS Agreement of the WTO when trading in agricultural goods.

2. The Parties shall use the definitions of Annex A of the SPS Agreement, as well as the standards, guidelines and recommendations established by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), Codex Alimentarius (CODEX) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). In the absence of international standards, the Parties shall use the standards, guidelines and recommendations of recognized regional organizations. Both Parties shall comply with the procedures established in this Annex.

Article 2. Harmonisation

1. In the harmonisation process, the Parties shall use the sanitary and phytosanitary standards, guidelines and recommendations established by the OIE, CODEX and the IPPC.

2. The Parties may introduce or maintain SPS measures which result in a higher level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection than would be achieved by measures based on the relevant international standards and guidelines or recommendations, if there is a scientific justification, or as a consequence of the level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection a Party determines to be appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraph 1 through 8 of Article 5 of the SPS Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, all measures which result in a level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection different from that which would be achieved by measures based on international standards, guidelines or recommendations shall not be inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement.

Article 3. Equivalence

1. Each Party shall accept the SPS measures of the other Party as equivalent, even if these measures differ from their own or from those used by other WTO Members trading in the same agricultural good or group of goods, if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that its measures achieve the importing Partyâ€™s appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection. For this purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing, and other relevant procedures.

2. The SPS measures agreed upon as equivalent by both Parties shall be established in accordance with the standards, guidelines and recommendations of the OIE, CODEX and the IPPC, or the regionally recognized organizations, or the organizations which have been recognized by both Parties.

3. In establishing the process to determine equivalence, the Parties shall take the following criteria into consideration:

a) the recognition and acceptance of equivalence is that process by which it is objectively demonstrated with scientific justification that the SPS measures adopted by the exporting Party provide the appropriate level of protection of the importing Party;
b) equivalence shall be determined on the SPS measure applied to an agricultural good or group of goods. Agreements of mutual recognition or agreements of equivalence of the SPS systems may, upon the request of one of the Parties, be established by mutual consent of the Parties, provided that such agreements take into consideration the obligations of the Parties under WTO;

c) it shall be the responsibility of the exporting Party to demonstrate that its SPS measures achieve the appropriate level of protection of the importing Party, to the same extent achieved by the SPS measures of the importing Party. It shall also be the responsibility of the exporting Party to provide the importing Party with all the necessary information within a reasonable time and in an appropriate manner. The exporting Party shall also facilitate the importing Party with access for inspection, control and approval procedures to grant recognition or equivalence;

4. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Article, a Party shall, upon request from the other Party, provide the requesting Party with all necessary information within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of receipt of the request. Said period may, however, be extended for an additional ten (10) calendar days upon the mutual agreement of the Parties.

5. To determine whether an SPS measure shall be deemed as equivalent, the Parties shall ensure that the SPS measure that they apply when trading in that agricultural good or group of goods complies with the standards, guidelines and recommendations established by OIE, CODEX, and the IPPC.

6. In the recognition and acceptance of equivalence, consideration shall be given to:

a) the existence of a trade history which shows a track record that the agricultural good or group of goods traded posed no significant risk to the agricultural health status of the importing Party;
b) the record of SPS compliance of the respective Parties with regard to the trade in the particular agricultural good or group of goods; and

c) the proven efficiency, integrity and experience of the inspection and certification systems.

Article 4. Risk Assessment

a) The Parties shall ensure that when a risk assessment is required to allow the importation of an agricultural good or group of goods, the assessment shall be conducted by the importing Party within ninety (90) calendar days, once the exporting Party provides all the information required by the importing Party to conduct the evaluation. Upon completion of the assessment, a technical report with the findings shall be presented.

b) When a risk assessment is necessary to maintain trade in an agricultural good or group of goods, the SPS measures shall not be more trade-restrictive than that required to achieve the appropriate level of SPS protection of the importing Party.

c) In an SPS emergency, the importing Party shall adopt SPS measures on the basis of available pertinent information and shall immediately notify the exporting Party of the measures adopted. Once additional technical and scientific information becomes available, the importing Party shall conduct a risk assessment within sixty (60) calendar days thereof to determine whether the emergency measures should be maintained, eliminated or changed depending on the findings of such assessment. The exporting Party shall be responsible for the prompt and full compliance with the measure as determined by the risk assessment conducted by the importing Party.

4. Where international standard setting organizations, mutually recognized regional organizations or any other mutually recognized organization or institution, determine that an agricultural good or group of goods can be traded safely, regardless of a particular agricultural health status, a risk assessment shall not be conducted by any of the Parties.

Article 5. Recognition of Free Areas

1. Based on Article VI of the SPS Agreement, the Parties shall not impede the access of an agricultural good or group of goods from an area or zone that has been bilaterally recognized as a pest or disease free area or an area of low pest prevalence, although the entire country has not been so declared.

2. The exporting Party shall be responsible of objectively demonstrating to the importing Party the status of an area or zone as pest or disease free or an area of low pest prevalence.

3. When a Party receives a request from the other Party for the recognition of an area or zone as pest or disease free or an area of low pest prevalence, the requested Party shall communicate its decision within the timeframe agreed upon by the Parties. In any event, such timeframe shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) working days.

4. In the process of acquiring recognition of pest and disease free areas or zones or areas of low pest prevalence, the Parties shall use the standards, guidelines and recommendations as established by the OIE, IPPC and CODEX.

5. When an area or zone is recognized as a pest or disease free area or as an area of low pest prevalence, it must be subjected to effective monitoring measures and control against the introduction and establishment of pest or disease from which it was recognized as free of or of low pest prevalence.

Article 6. Control, Inspection and Approval Procedures
