used for retail sale shall be considered as originating or non-originating, as the
case may be, in calculating the value of the goods.

3. This Article does not apply where the accessories, spare parts, tools or
instructional and information materials have been added solely for the purpose of
artificially raising the QVC of the goods.
Article 3.12
Indirect Materials
 Indirect materials shall be considered to be originating materials, without
regard to where they were produced, and their value shall be the cost registered
in the accounting records of the producer of the goods. 
20
Article 3.13
Identical and Interchangeable Goods and Materials
 For the purpose of establishing if a good is originating, when its
manufacture utilises originating and non-originating materials, mixed or
physically combined, the origin of such materials shall be determined by
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of stock control or inventory
management applicable in the exporting Party.
Article 3.14

supported by a Declaration of Origin or Certificate of Origin as set out in Annex 3

 If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a Customs duty pursuant to
this Agreement, an originating product of a Party is being imported into the other
Party’s territory in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to
domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause
serious injury to a domestic industry producing like or directly competitive
products, the other Party may, to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy
serious injury and facilitate adjustment, apply a safeguard measure consisting of:
(a) the suspension of the further reduction of any rate of Customs duty
provided for under this Agreement on the originating product from 
30
the date on which the action to apply the safeguard measure is
taken; or

apply the safeguard measure is taken.
Article 5.7
Scope and Duration of Safeguard Measures
1. A Party shall apply a safeguard measure for such period of time as may
be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. A
Party may apply a safeguard measure for an initial period of no longer than two
years. The period of a safeguard measure may be extended by up to one year
provided that the conditions of this Chapter are met and that the safeguard
measure continues to be applied to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy
serious injury and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting. The total
period of a safeguard measure, including any extensions thereof, shall not
exceed three years.
2. Regardless of its duration or whether it has been subject to extension, a
safeguard measure on a product shall terminate at the end of the transition
period for such product. No new safeguard measure may be applied to a product
after the end of the transition period.
3. In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the proposed duration
of a safeguard measure is over one year, the Party applying the safeguard
measure shall progressively liberalise it at regular intervals during the application
of the safeguard measure, including at the time of any extension.
4. A Party shall not apply a safeguard or provisional measure again on the
same originating product for a period of time equal to the duration of the previous
safeguard measure or two years, whichever is longer. 
31
5. A Party shall not apply a safeguard or provisional measure on an
originating product that is subject to a measure that the Party has applied

measure is being applied, it shall terminate the safeguard measure prior to the
imposition of the action to be applied pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and

6. Each Party shall not apply a safeguard or provisional measure on an
originating product imported up to the limit of quota quantities granted under tariff
rate quotas applied in accordance with its Tariff Schedule in Annex 1 (Schedules
of Tariff Commitments).
7. On the termination of a safeguard measure, the Party that applied the
measure shall apply the rate of Customs duty in effect as set out in its Tariff
Schedule as specified in Annex 1 (Schedules of Tariff Commitments) on the date
of termination as if the safeguard measure had never been applied.
Article 5.8
Investigation
1. A Party may apply or extend a safeguard measure only following an
investigation by the Party’s competent authorities in accordance with the same
procedures as those provided for in Articles 3 and 4.2 of the WTO Agreement on
Safeguards.
2. The investigation shall include reasonable public notice to all interested
parties and public hearings or other appropriate means in which importers,
exporters and other interested parties could present evidence and their views,
including the opportunity to respond to the presentations of other parties and to
submit their views, inter alia, as to whether or not the application of a safeguard
measure would be in the public interest.
3. An investigation shall as far as possible be completed within 180 days
after being initiated but in no case shall exceed one year. A Party shall prior to
the 180th day notify the other Party of the expected duration of the investigation,
if the investigation is likely to take more than 180 days to complete. Upon
completion of an investigation, the competent authorities shall promptly publish a
report setting forth their findings and reasoned conclusions reached on all
pertinent issues of fact and law. 
32
Article 5.9
Provisional Measures
1. In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which would
be difficult to repair, a Party may apply a provisional measure, which shall take
the form of the measure set out in Article 5.6(1)(a) or 1(b) (Application of
Safeguard Measures), pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear
evidence that increased imports of an originating product of the other Party as a
result of the reduction or elimination of a duty pursuant to this Agreement have
caused or are threatening to cause serious injury.
2. The duration of such a provisional measure shall as far as possible not
exceed 120 days, but shall not extend beyond 200 days, during which period the
pertinent requirements of Articles 5.5 (Definitions) to 5.8 (Investigation) shall be
met. The duration of any such provisional measure shall be counted as part of
the total period referred to in Article 5.7 (Scope and Duration of Safeguard
Measures).
3. Any additional Customs duties collected as a result of such a provisional
measure shall be promptly refunded if the subsequent investigation referred to in
Article 5.8 (Investigation) does not determine that increased imports of an
originating product of the other Party have caused or threatened to cause serious
injury to a domestic industry. In such a case, the Party that applied the
provisional measure shall apply the rate of Customs duty set out in its Tariff
Schedule in Annex 1 (Schedules of Tariff Commitments) as if the provisional
measure had never applied.
Article 5.10
Notification and Consultation
1. A Party shall promptly notify the other Party, in writing, upon:
(a) initiating an investigation under Article 5.8 (Investigation);
(b) making a finding of serious injury or threat thereof caused by
increased imports of an originating product of the other Party as a
result of the reduction or elimination of a Customs duty on the
product pursuant to this Agreement;
(c) taking a decision to apply or extend a safeguard measure, or to
apply a provisional measure; and
(d) taking a decision to progressively liberalise a safeguard measure
previously applied.

report of its competent authorities required under Article 5.8(1) (Investigation) 
33

initiation of the investigation, a precise description of an originating product
subject to the investigation and its subheading or more detailed level of the HS,
the period subject to the investigation and the date of initiation of the
investigation shall be included.
4. In notifying under paragraphs 1(b) and (c), the Party applying or extending
a safeguard measure shall also provide evidence of serious injury or threat
thereof caused by increased imports of an originating product of the other Party
as a result of the reduction or elimination of a Customs duty pursuant to this
Agreement; a precise description of the product involved and its subheading or
more detailed level of the HS; the details of the proposed safeguard measure;
and the date of introduction, duration and timetable for progressive liberalisation
of the measure, if such timetable is applicable. In the case of an extension of a
safeguard measure, evidence that the domestic industry concerned is adjusting
shall also be provided. Upon request, the Party applying or extending a
safeguard measure shall to the extent possible provide additional information as
the other Party may consider necessary.
5. A Party proposing to apply or extend a safeguard measure shall provide
adequate opportunity for prior consultations with the other Party, with a view to,
inter alia, reviewing the information provided under paragraph 4, exchanging
views on the safeguard measure and reaching an agreement on compensation
as set forth in Article 5.11(1) (Compensation).
6. Where a Party applies a provisional measure referred to in Article 5.9
(Provisional Measures), on request of the other Party, consultations shall be
initiated immediately after such application.
7. The provisions on notification in this Article shall not require a Party to
disclose confidential information the disclosure of which would impede law
enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or would prejudice
the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.
Article 5.11
Compensation
1. A Party proposing to apply a safeguard measure shall, in consultation with
the other Party, provide to the other Party mutually agreed trade compensation in
the form of substantially equivalent concessions during the period of application
of the safeguard measure. Such consultations shall begin within 30 days of the
decision to apply the safeguard measure and, in accordance with Article 5.10(5)
(Notification and Consultation), shall take place prior to the application of the
safeguard measure. 
34
2. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement on compensation within 30
days of the commencement of the consultations, the exporting Party shall be free
to suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the trade of
the Party applying the safeguard measure.
3. A Party shall notify the other Party in writing at least 30 days before
suspending concessions under paragraph 2.
4. The Party exercising the right of suspension shall suspend the application
of concessions of Customs duties only for the minimum period necessary to
achieve the substantially equivalent effects and only while the bilateral safeguard
measure is maintained. The right of suspension provided for in this paragraph
shall not be exercised for the first year that the safeguard measure is in effect,
provided that the bilateral safeguard measure has been applied as the result of
an absolute increase in imports and that such a measure conforms to this
Section.
5. The obligation to provide compensation under paragraph 1 and the right to
suspend substantially equivalent concessions under paragraph 2 shall terminate
on the date of the termination of the safeguard measure.

other under the WTO TBT Agreement.
Article 7.4
Scope
1. This Chapter applies to all standards, technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures that may affect the trade in goods between the Parties,
except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3.
2. This Chapter does not apply to purchasing specifications prepared by
governmental entities for production or consumption requirements of such
entities.

relevant parts are ineffective or inappropriate to fulfil legitimate regulatory
objectives.
2. The Parties shall cooperate with each other, where appropriate, in the
context of their participation in international standardising bodies, to ensure that
international standards developed within such organisations are trade facilitating
and do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
Article 7.6
Conformity Assessment Procedures
1. In accordance with the objective of facilitating trade, the Parties shall seek
to increase efficiency, avoid duplication and ensure cost effectiveness by the use
of a range of appropriate mechanisms, including but not limited to:

3. The Parties may consult on such matters as the technical competence of
the conformity assessment bodies involved, as appropriate, to enhance

territory and it refuses to accredit or otherwise recognise a body of the other
Party assessing conformity with that technical regulation or standard, it shall, on
request, explain the reasons for its refusal.
6. The Parties shall cooperate with the objectives of reducing compliance
and administrative costs and the effective monitoring of compliance with their
legitimate regulatory objectives.

negotiations on facilitating recognition of the results of conformity assessment
procedures conducted by bodies of the other Party, it shall, on request, explain
its reasons.

technical regulations in meeting its legitimate objectives and achieving the same
level of protection.

(a) aviation;
(b) fisheries; and
(c) maritime matters.
Article 8.9
Recognition
1. For the purposes of the fulfilment, in whole or in part, of its standards or
criteria for the registration, authorisation, licensing, or certification of service 
64
suppliers, and subject to the requirements of paragraph 5, a Party may recognise
the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or
certification granted in the other Party.
2. Recognition referred to in paragraph 1, which may be achieved through
harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement
between the Parties or may be accorded unilaterally.
3. Where a Party recognises, autonomously or by agreement or
arrangement, the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or
licenses or certifications granted in the territory of a third party, nothing in
Article 8.8 (Most Favoured Nation Treatment) shall be construed to require the
Party to accord such recognition to the education or experience obtained,
requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of the other
Party.
4. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type
referred to in paragraph 3, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate
opportunity for the other Party, upon request, to negotiate its accession to such
an agreement or arrangement or to negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a
Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for
the other Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licenses, or
certifications obtained or requirements met in that other Party’s territory should
be recognised.
5. A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a
means of discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or
criteria for the registration, authorisation, licensing, or certification of service
suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.
6. Within two years of entry into force of this Agreement, both Parties shall
encourage the development of mutual recognition arrangements among
competent bodies on professional services, by facilitating discussion between

Article 8.11
Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its

act in a manner inconsistent with the Party’s commitments under this Chapter.
2. Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an
affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly
rights and which is subject to that Party’s specific commitments, the Party shall
ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its
territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.
3. If a Party has a reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of
the other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, it may
request the other Party establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to
provide specific information concerning the relevant operations.

negative impact caused by its specific commitments as set out in Annex 4
(Schedules of Specific Services Commitments), that Party may request to hold a
consultation with the other Party and the other Party shall respond to such a
request in good faith.
3. In the consultations, the Parties shall endeavour to reach a mutually 
66
acceptable solution within a reasonable time.
Article 8.13

1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 17.3 (Measures to
Safeguard Balance of Payments), a Party shall not apply restrictions on
international transfers and payments for current transactions relating to trade in
services.

as members of the International Monetary Fund (“the Fund”) under the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, including the use of exchange
actions which are in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital
transactions inconsistently with its commitments under this Chapter regarding
such transactions, except under Article 17.3 (Measures to Safeguard Balance of
Payments) or at the request of the Fund.
Article 8.14
Denial of Benefits
1. Subject to prior notification, a Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter
to a service supplier of the other Party where the Party establishes that:
(a) the service is being supplied by an enterprise that is owned or
controlled by persons of a third party and the enterprise has no
substantive business operations in the territory of the other Party;
or
(b) the service is being supplied by an enterprise that is owned or
controlled by persons of the denying Party and the enterprise has
no substantive business operations in the territory of the other
Party.
2. A Party that denies benefits pursuant to paragraph 1 shall enter into
consultations within 30 days following notification if requested by the other Party.
Such consultations shall be without prejudice to the Parties’ rights under the
Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement).
Article 8.15
Review of Commitments
1. The Parties shall enter into successive rounds of negotiations, beginning
no later than two years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and 
67
periodically thereafter as determined by the Joint Commission, with a view to
further improving specific commitments under this Chapter so as to progressively
liberalise trade in services between the Parties.
2. If a Party concludes an agreement on trade in services on a “negative list”
basis4
 with a third party after this Agreement comes into force, that Party shall, at
the request of the other Party, within three months from this request, commence
re-negotiation of the specific commitments set out in Annex 4 (Schedules of
Specific Services Commitments) with a view to the progressive liberalisation of
trade in services between them. The re-negotiation shall proceed on a “negative
list” basis. The Parties shall endeavour to conclude the re-negotiation on the
specific commitments within 18 months from the date the negotiations
commence.
3. Any review of commitments undertaken under this Article shall also
include a review of Article 8.8 (Most Favoured Nation Treatment) with a view to
progressive extension of the Most Favoured Nation Treatment to additional
services sectors not listed in Annex 5 (Most Favoured Nation Treatment Sectoral
Coverage Under Article 8.8).
Article 8.16
Modification of Schedules
1. A Party ("modifying Party") may modify or withdraw any commitment in its
Schedules in Annex 4 (Schedules of Specific Services Commitments) and Annex
6 (Schedules of Movement of Natural Persons Commitments) at any time after
three years have elapsed from the date on which that commitment entered into
force.
2. The modifying Party shall notify the other Party ("the affected Party") of its
intent to modify or withdraw a commitment pursuant to this Article no later than
three months before the intended date of implementation of the modification or
withdrawal.
3. The modifying Party may only modify or withdraw its commitments where
the modifying Party makes compensatory adjustments to its Schedules to
maintain a general level of mutually advantageous commitments that is no less
favourable to trade in services than provided for in its Schedules prior to the
modification.

4
 A “negative list” utilises an approach whereby a Party is required to apply certain obligations of
the Chapter, such as market access and national treatment, to all services and services
suppliers, unless a reservation is made in the Party’s schedule appended to the agreement. It is
commonly contrasted with a “positive list” approach whereby certain obligations, such as market
access and national treatment, only apply to services and service suppliers to the extent that a
Party makes a specific commitment to this effect in its schedule. 
68
4. Upon notification of a Party's intent to make such modification, the Parties
shall consult and attempt to reach agreement on the appropriate compensatory
adjustment.
5. If agreement pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4 is not reached between the
modifying Party and the affected Party within three months, the affected Party
may refer the matter to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in
Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement).
6. The modifying Party may not modify or withdraw its commitment until it
has made the necessary adjustments in conformity with the findings of the
arbitration in relation to the question of whether paragraph 3 is satisfied in
accordance with paragraph 5.
Article 8.17
Subsidies
1. Notwithstanding Article 8.3(4)(c) (Scope and Coverage), the Parties shall
review the issue of disciplines on subsidies related to trade in services in the light
of any disciplines agreed under Article XV of GATS.
2. The Parties recognise that, in certain circumstances, subsidies may have
distortive effects on trade in services. Any Party which considers that it is
adversely affected by a subsidy of the other Party may request consultations with
that Party on such matters. Such request shall be accorded sympathetic
consideration.
Article 8.18
Domestic Regulation
1. Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting
trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial
manner.
2. With a view to ensuring that any measure maintained or adopted by a
Party relating to the authorisation, licensing or qualification of service suppliers of
the other Party does not constitute an unnecessary barrier to trade in services,
each Party shall ensure that such a measure:
(a) is based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence
and the ability to supply the service;
(b) is not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the
service; and 
69
(c) does not constitute a disguised restriction on the supply of the
services.
3. If the results of the negotiations under Article VI.4 of GATS enter into
effect, the Parties shall jointly review these results with a view to their
incorporation into this Agreement.
4. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations under
paragraph 2, account shall be taken of international standards of relevant
international organisations applied by that Party.
5. Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service on which a
specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of that Party
shall:
(a) in the case of an incomplete application, at the request of the
applicant, identify all the additional information that is required to
complete the application and provide the opportunity to remedy
deficiencies within a reasonable timeframe;
(b) within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an
application considered complete under domestic laws and
regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the
application;

resubmitting, at its discretion, a new application.
6. In sectors where specific commitments regarding professional services
are undertaken, each Party shall provide for adequate procedures to verify the
competency of professionals of the other Party.
Article 8.19

Chapter, the Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade in Services (“the

equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation a covered investment of an investor
of the other Party (“expropriation”) except:
(a) for a public purpose9
;
(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;
(c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in
accordance with paragraphs 2 through 4; and
(d) in accordance with due process of law.
2. Compensation shall:
(a) be paid without delay10;
(b) be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before the expropriation took place (“the
date of expropriation”);
(c) not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended
expropriation had become known earlier; and

8
 This Article shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 7 (Expropriation). 9
 For the avoidance of doubt, where Malaysia is the expropriating Party, any measure of
expropriation relating to land shall be for the purposes as set out in the Land Acquisition Act
1960, Land Acquisition Ordinance 1950 of the State of Sabah and the Land Code 1958 of the
State of Sarawak.
10 The Parties understand that there may be legal and administrative processes that need to be
observed before payment can be made.
84
(d) be fully realisable and freely transferable.
3. If the fair market value is denominated in a freely usable currency, the
compensation paid shall be no less than the fair market value on the date of
expropriation, plus interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency,
accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment, unless such
rate is prescribed by law11. Where that value cannot be readily ascertained, the
compensation shall be determined in accordance with generally recognised
principles of valuation and equitable principles taking into account, where
appropriate, the capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated,
replacement value, currency exchange rate movements and other relevant
factors.
4. If the fair market value is denominated in a currency that is not freely
usable, the compensation paid, converted into the currency of payment at the
market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, shall be no less than:
(a) the fair market value on the date of expropriation, converted into a
freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on
that date; plus
(b) interest, at a commercially reasonable rate for that freely usable
currency, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of
payment.
5. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted
in relation to intellectual property rights in accordance with the WTO TRIPS
Agreement.
Article 10.9
Compensation for Losses
Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party, and to covered
investments, with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to losses
suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed conflict, civil strife or state
of emergency, treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like
circumstances, to:
(a) its own investors and their investments; and
(b) investors of a third party and their investments.

11 In the case of Malaysia, the interest rates prescribed by law are as set out in the Land
Acquisition Act 1960, Land Acquisition Ordinance 1950 of the State of Sabah and the Land Code
1958 of the State of Sarawak.
85
Article 10.10
Minimum Standard of Treatment
1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security.
2. For greater certainty:

(a) fair and equitable treatment requires each Party not to deny justice
in any legal or administrative proceedings;
(b) full protection and security requires each Party to take such
measures as may be reasonably necessary to ensure the
protection and security of the covered investment; and
(c) the concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection
and security” do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that
which is required under customary international law, and do not
create additional substantive rights.
3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this
Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that
there has been a breach of this Article.
Article 10.11
Non-Conforming Measures12
1. Articles 10.4 (National treatment) and 10.5 (Most Favoured Nation
Treatment), shall not apply to:
(a) any existing non-conforming measure maintained by a Party at:
(i) the central and regional level of Government, as set out by
that Party in its Schedule to Annex I; or
(ii) a local level of Government;
(b) the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure
referred to in subparagraph (a); or
(c) an amendment to any non-conforming measures referred to in
subparagraph (a), provided that the amendment does not decrease
the level of conformity of the measure as it existed at the date of
entry into force of the Party’s Schedule to Annex I with Articles 10.4

12 The application of this Article is subject to Article 10.17 (Work Programme). 
86
(National Treatment) and 10.5 (Most Favoured Nation Treatment).
2. Articles 10.4 (National Treatment) and 10.5 (Most Favoured Nation
Treatment) do not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with
respect to sectors, sub-sectors, or activities, as set out in its Schedule to
Annex II.
3. The Parties will endeavour to progressively remove the non-conforming
measures.
4. Neither Party may, under any measure adopted after the date of entry into
force of the Schedules referred to in Article 10.17 (Work Programme) and
covered by its Schedule to Annex II, require an investor of the other Party, by
reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment existing at
the time the measure becomes effective.
Article 10.12
Special Formalities and Disclosure of Information
1. Nothing in Article 10.4 (National Treatment) or 10.5 (Most Favoured
Nation Treatment) shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or
maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with
covered investments, including a requirement that covered investments be
legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that such
formalities do not substantially impair the protections afforded by a Party to
investors of the other Party and covered investments pursuant to this Chapter.
2. Notwithstanding Article 10.4 (National Treatment) or 10.5 (Most Favoured
Nation Treatment) a Party may require an investor of the other Party, or a
covered investment, to provide information concerning that investment solely for
informational or statistical purposes. The Party receiving such information shall
protect, to the extent possible, any confidential information which has been
provided from any disclosure that would prejudice legitimate commercial
interests of the investor or the covered investment. Nothing in this paragraph
shall be construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or disclosing
information in connection with the equitable and good faith application of its law.
Article 10.13
Subrogation
1. If a Party or its designated agency makes a payment to an investor of that
Party under a guarantee, a contract of insurance against non-commercial risks or
other form of indemnity it has granted in respect of an investment, the other Party
shall recognise the subrogation or transfer of any right or title in respect of such
investment. The subrogated or transferred right or claim shall not be greater than
the original right or claim of the investor. 
87
2. Where a Party or its designated agency has made a payment to an
investor of that Party and has taken over rights and claims of the investor, that
investor shall not, unless authorised to act on behalf of the Party or the
designated agency of the Party making the payment, pursue those rights and
claims against the other Party.
3. In any proceeding involving an investment dispute, a Party shall not
assert, as a defence, counter-claim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the investor
or the covered investment has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance
or guarantee contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of any
alleged loss.
Article 10.14
Denial of Benefits
 Subject to prior notification and consultation, a Party may deny the
benefits of this Chapter to:
(a) investors of the other Party where the investment is being made by
an enterprise that is owned or controlled by persons of a third party
and the enterprise has no substantive business operations in the
territory of the other Party; or
(b) investors of the other Party where the investment is being made by
an enterprise that is owned or controlled by persons of the denying
Party and the enterprise has no substantive business operations in
the territory of the other Party.
Article 10.15
Investment and Environment
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from
adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this
Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its
territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.
Article 10.16
Promotion and Facilitation of Investment
 The Parties shall seek to strengthen and build on existing cooperative
arrangements in the promotion and facilitation of investment where this is of
mutual benefit, including through:

apart from the merits of the claim. The disputing parties shall be given a

that effect.
3. The Tribunal may, if warranted, award the prevailing party reasonable

10.8 (Expropriation) by the adoption or enforcement of a taxation measure, the
disputing Party and the non-disputing Party shall, upon request from the

whether such taxation measure has an effect equivalent to expropriation or
nationalisation within the period of 180 days from the date of the receipt of
request for consultation referred to in Article 10.21(1) (Submission of a Claim to
Arbitration), the disputing investor shall not be prevented from submitting its
claim to arbitration in accordance with this Section.

(Compensation and Suspension of Benefits). If the Arbitral Tribunal decides that
the level of benefits suspended by the complaining Party is excessive, the

priority to economic sectors which are more essential to their economic
development. However, such restrictions shall not be adopted or maintained for
the purpose of protecting a particular sector.
4. Any restrictions adopted or maintained by a Party under paragraph 1, or
any changes therein, shall be notified promptly to the other Party from the date
such measures are taken.
5. The Party adopting or maintaining any restrictions under paragraph 1 shall
promptly commence consultations with the other Party from the date of

Article 17.4
Prudential Measures
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, a Party shall not
be prevented from taking measures affecting the supply of financial services for
prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy
holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service
supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. Where
such measures do not conform with the provisions of this Agreement, they shall
not be used as a means of avoiding the Party’s commitments or obligations
under this Agreement.
Article 17.5
Taxation Measures
1. Except as provided in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to
taxation measures.
2. This Agreement shall only grant rights or impose obligations with respect 
124
to taxation measures:
(a) where corresponding rights or obligations are also granted or
imposed under the WTO Agreement; or
(b) under Article 10.8 (Expropriation).
3. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of the
Parties under any tax convention relating to the avoidance of double taxation in
force between the Parties.
4. If there is a dispute described in Article 10.19(1) (Scope) that may relate
to a taxation measure, then the Parties, including representatives of their tax
administrations, shall hold consultations. Any tribunal established under Article
10.21 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) shall accept a decision of the Parties
as to whether the measure in question is a taxation measure.
5. In the event of any inconsistency relating to a taxation measure between
this Agreement and the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand
and the Government of Malaysia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the
Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income, done at Kuala
Lumpur on 19 March 1976, with Protocols, the latter shall prevail. Any
consultations between the Parties about whether an inconsistency relates to a
taxation measure shall include representatives of the tax administration of each
Party.17
Article 17.6
Treaty of Waitangi
1. Provided that such measures are not used as a means of arbitrary or
unjustified discrimination against persons of the other Party or as a disguised
restriction on trade in goods and services, nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deems necessary to
accord more favourable treatment to Maori in respect of matters covered by this
Agreement including in fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi.
2. The Parties agree that the interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi,
including as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not
be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement. Chapter 16
(Dispute Settlement) shall otherwise apply to this Article. An Arbitral Tribunal
established under Article 16.8 (Request for the Establishment of an Arbitral
Tribunal) may be requested by Malaysia to determine only whether any measure
referred to in paragraph 1 is inconsistent with their rights under this Agreement.

17 Nothing in this Agreement shall be regarded as obliging a Party to extend to the other Party the
benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege arising from any existing or future agreement on
the avoidance of double taxation or from the provisions on the avoidance of double taxation in
any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Party is bound.
