there is clear evidence that increased imports of
an originating good have caused or are
threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic
industry.

emergency measure and its subheading of the
Harmonized System, a precise description of
the emergency measure, the proposed date of
its introduction and its expected duration.
 (c) When the Party provides the other Party with
pertinent information that includes confidential
information, the other Party may only disclose
non-confidential part, summary or version thereof

1. With respect to market access through the modes of
supply defined in subparagraph (t) of Article 71, each
Party shall accord services and service suppliers of the
other Party treatment no less favorable than that provided
for under the terms, limitations and conditions agreed and
specified in its Schedule of Specific Commitments in Part 1
of Annex 6. 
64
 Note: If a Party undertakes a market-access
commitment in relation to the supply of a
service through the mode of supply referred to
in subparagraph (t)(i) of Article 71 and if the
cross-border movement of capital is an
essential part of the service itself, that
Party is thereby committed to allow such
movement of capital. If a Party undertakes a
market-access commitment in relation to the
supply of a service through the mode of supply
referred to in subparagraph (t)(iii) of Article
71, it is thereby committed to allow related
transfers of capital into its Area.
2. In sectors where market-access commitments are
undertaken, the measures which a Party shall not maintain
or adopt either on the basis of a regional subdivision or
on the basis of its entire Area, unless otherwise specified
in its Schedule of Specific Commitments in Part 1 of Annex
6, are defined as:
 (a) limitations on the number of service suppliers
whether in the form of numerical quotas,
monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the
requirements of an economic needs test;
 (b) limitations on the total value of service
transactions or assets in the form of numerical
quotas or the requirement of an economic needs
test;
 (c) limitations on the total number of service
operations or on the total quantity of service
output expressed in terms of designated numerical
units in the form of quotas or the requirement of
an economic needs test;
 Note: This subparagraph does not cover measures
of a Party which limit inputs for the
supply of services.
 (d) limitations on the total number of natural
persons that may be employed in a particular
service sector or that a service supplier may
employ and who are necessary for, and directly
related to, the supply of a specific service in
the form of numerical quotas or the requirement
of an economic needs test; 
65
 (e) measures which restrict or require specific types
of legal entity or joint venture through which a
service supplier may supply a service; and
 (f) limitations on the participation of foreign
capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on
foreign shareholding or the total value of
individual or aggregate foreign investment.
Article 73
National Treatment
1. In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule of Specific
Commitments in Part 1 of Annex 6, and subject to any
conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party
shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other
Party, in respect of all measures affecting the supply of
services, treatment no less favorable than that it accords
to its own like services and service suppliers.
 Note: Specific commitments assumed under this Article
shall not be construed to require either Party
to compensate for any inherent competitive
disadvantages which result from the foreign
character of the relevant services or service
suppliers.
2. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 above
by according to services and service suppliers of the other
Party, either formally identical treatment or formally
different treatment to that it accords to its own like
services and service suppliers.
3. Formally identical or formally different treatment
shall be considered to be less favorable if it modifies the
conditions of competition in favor of services or service
suppliers of a Party compared to like services or service
suppliers of the other Party.
Article 74
Additional Commitments
 The Parties may negotiate commitments with respect to
measures affecting trade in services not subject to
scheduling under Articles 72 and 73, including those

Article 75
Schedule of Specific Commitments

Commitments it undertakes under Articles 72, 73 and 74.

are undertaken, each Schedule of Specific Commitments in
Part 1 of Annex 6 shall specify:
 (a) terms, limitations and conditions on market
access;
 (b) conditions and qualifications on national
treatment;
 (c) undertakings relating to additional commitments;
and
 (d) where appropriate, the time-frame for
implementation of such commitments.
3. With respect to sectors or subsectors where the
specific commitments are undertaken and which are indicated
with “SS”, any terms, limitations, conditions and
qualifications, referred to in subparagraphs 2(a) and (b)
above, shall be limited to existing non-conforming
measures.
4. Measures inconsistent with both Articles 72 and 73
shall be inscribed in the column relating to Article 72.

or qualification to Article 73 as well.

this Agreement as Part 1 of Annex 6.
Article 76
Most-Favored-Nation Treatment
1. Each Party shall accord to services and service
suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favorable
than that it accords, in like circumstances, to services
and service suppliers of any non-Party.

any measure by a Party with respect to sectors, subsectors
or activities, as set out in its Schedule to Part 2 of
Annex 6. 
67
Article 77
Authorization, Licensing or Qualification
 With a view to ensuring that any measure by a Party
relating to the authorization, licensing or qualification
of service suppliers of the other Party does not constitute
an unnecessary barrier to trade in services, each Party
shall endeavor to ensure that such measure:
 (a) is based on objective and transparent criteria,
such as competence and the ability to supply the
service;
 (b) is not more burdensome than necessary to ensure
the quality of the service; and
 (c) does not constitute a disguised restriction on
the supply of the services.
Article 78
Mutual Recognition
1. A Party may recognize the education or experience
obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications
granted in the other Party for the purposes of the
fulfillment, in whole or in part, of its standards or
criteria for the authorization, licensing or certification
of service suppliers of the other Party.
2. Recognition referred to in paragraph 1 above, which
may be achieved through harmonization or otherwise, may be
based upon an agreement or arrangement between the Parties
or may be accorded unilaterally.
3. Where a Party recognizes, by agreement or arrangement
between the Party and a non-Party or unilaterally, the
education or experience obtained, requirements met or
licenses or certifications granted in the non-Party;
 (a) nothing in Article 76 shall be construed to
require the Party to accord such recognition to
the education or experience obtained,
requirements met or licenses or certifications
granted in the other Party; and
 (b) the Party shall accord the other Party an
adequate opportunity to demonstrate that the
education or experience obtained, requirements
met or licenses or certifications granted in the
other Party should also be recognized. 
68

The list shall include the following elements and shall be
reviewed annually and revised as necessary:
 (a) sector and subsector or matter;
 (b) type of inconsistency (i.e. Market Access and/or
National Treatment);
 (c) legal source or authority of the measure; and
 (d) succinct description of the measure.
 Note: The list under this paragraph will be made
solely for the purposes of transparency, and
shall not be construed to affect any rights and
obligations of a Party under this Chapter.
Article 80
Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of
a service in its Area does not, in the supply of the
monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner
inconsistent with the Party’s specific commitments. 
69
2. Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either
directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of
a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and
which is subject to that Party’s specific commitments, the
Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its
monopoly position to act in its Area in a manner
inconsistent with such commitments.

maintained for the purposes of protecting a particular
service sector.

construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by either
Party of measures:
