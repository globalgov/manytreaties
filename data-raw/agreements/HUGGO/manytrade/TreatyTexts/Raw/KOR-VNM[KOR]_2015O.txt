2. The formula for calculating the regional value content (hereinafter referred to as
„‟RVC‟‟) will be either3
:
(a) Direct / Build-Up Method


1 The Parties understand that for the purposes of determining the origin of products of sea-fishing and other
products, “rights” in this subparagraph include those rights of access to the fisheries resources of a coastal state,
as accruing from agreements or other arrangements concluded between a Party and the coastal state at the level
of governments or duly authorized private entities.
2
“International law” in this subparagraph refers to generally accepted international law such as the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
3 The Parties shall be given the flexibility to adopt the method of calculating the RVC, whether it is the build-up
or the build-down method.
3-3
 VOM
RVC = ----------------------- x 100%
FOB
VOM means value of originating materials, which includes the value of
originating material cost, labor cost, overhead cost, profit and other costs,

where the working or processing has taken place.
3. For the purposes of paragraph 1 and the relevant Product Specific Rules set out in
Annex 3-A, the rules requiring that the materials that are used have undergone a change in
tariff classification, or a specific manufacturing or processing operation, shall apply only to
non-originating materials.
4. When an originating good is used in the subsequent production of another good, no
account shall be taken of the non-originating materials contained in the originating good for
the purposes of determining the originating status of the subsequently produced good.
3-4
Article 3.4 : Product Specific Rules
For the purposes of Article 3.1, goods which satisfy the Product Specific Rules provided in
Annex 3-A shall be considered to be originating in the territory of the Party where working or
processing of the goods has taken place.
Article 3.5 : Treatment for Certain Goods
Notwithstanding Articles 3.1, 3.3 and 3.4, certain goods shall be considered to be originating
even if the production process or operation has been undertaken in the Gaeseong Industrial
Complex located in the Korean Peninsula, on materials exported from a Party and
subsequently re-imported to that Party provided that the conditions set out in Annex 3-B are
fulfilled.
Article 3.6 : Accumulation
Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter, a good originating in the territory of a Party,
which is used in the territory of the other Party as material for a finished good eligible for
preferential tariff treatment, shall be considered to be originating in the territory of the latter
Party where working or processing of the finished good has taken place.4
Article 3.7 : Non-Qualifying Operations
1. Notwithstanding any provision in this Chapter, a good shall not be considered to be
originating in the territory of a Party if the following operations are undertaken, exclusively
by itself or in combination, in the territory of that Party:

the required change in tariff classification does not exceed 10 percent of the
FOB value of the good;
and the good specified in subparagraphs (a) and (b) meets all other applicable criteria
set out in this Chapter for qualifying as an originating good.
2. The value of non-originating materials referred to in paragraph 1 shall, however, be
included in the value of non-originating materials for any applicable RVC requirement for the
good.
Article 3.10 : Treatment of Packaging and Packing Materials
1. (a) If a good is subject to the RVC criterion as set out in Article 3.3 and Annex
3-A, the value of the packaging and packing materials for retail sale shall be taken

materials are considered to be forming a whole with the good.
(b) If a good is subject to a criterion other than the RVC criterion as set out in
Article 3.3 and Annex 3-A, the packaging and packing materials for retail sale shall,
if classified together with the packaged good, be disregarded in determining whether
all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good satisfy the

presented with a good shall not be taken into account in determining the origin of the good,
provided that such accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or other informational
materials are classified with the good and their customs duties are collected with the good by
the importing Party.
Article 3.12 : Neutral Elements
In order to determine whether a good originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the
origin of the following which might be used in its production and not incorporated into the
good:
(a) fuel and energy;
(b) tools, dies and moulds;
(c) spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and
buildings;
(d) lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in
production or used to operate equipment and buildings;
(e) gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies;
(f) equipment, devices and supplies used for testing or inspecting the good; and

TRADE REMEDIES
Section A : Safeguard Measures
Article 7.1 : Application of a Safeguard Measure
If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, an
originating good of the other Party is being imported into the territory of a Party in such
increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such
conditions that the imports of such originating good from the other Party constitute a
substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like
or directly competitive good in the territory of the importing Party, the Party may take a
safeguard measure in the form of:
(a) suspending the further reduction of any rate of customs duty on the good
provided for under this Agreement; or
(b) increasing the rate of customs duty on the good to a level not to exceed the
lesser of:
(i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty on the good in
effect at the time the action is taken; or
(ii) the base rate of customs duty specified in the Schedule to Annex 2-A
(Reduction or Elimination of Customs Duties) pursuant to Article 2.3
(Reduction or Elimination of Customs Duties).
Article 7.2 : Conditions and Limitations
1. A Party shall notify the other Party in writing on initiation of an investigation
described in paragraph 2 and shall consult with the other Party as far in advance of applying a
safeguard measure as practicable, with a view to reviewing the information arising from the
investigation and exchanging views on the measure.
2. A Party shall apply a safeguard measure only following an investigation by the
Party‟s competent authorities in accordance with Articles 3 and 4.2(c) of the Safeguards
Agreement, and to this end, Articles 3 and 4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement are
incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.
3. In the investigation described in paragraph 2, the Party shall comply with the
requirements of Articles 4.2(a) and 4.2(b) of the Safeguards Agreement, and to this end,
Articles 4.2(a) and 4.2(b) of the Safeguards Agreement are incorporated into and made a part
of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.
7-2
4. Each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities complete any such investigation
within one year of the date of initiation.
5. Neither Party may apply a safeguard measure:
(a) except to the extent, and for such time, as may be necessary to prevent or
remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment;
(b) for a period exceeding two years, except that the period may be extended by
up to one year if the competent authorities of the importing Party determine, in
conformity with the procedures specified in this Article, that the measure
continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate
adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting, provided
that the total period of application of a safeguard measure, including the
period of initial application and any extension thereof, shall not exceed three
years; or
(c) beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the consent of the
other Party.
6. Neither Party may apply a safeguard measure more than once against the same good.
7. Where the expected duration of the safeguard measure is over one year, the importing
Party shall progressively liberalize it at regular intervals.
8. When a Party terminates a safeguard measure, the customs duty rate shall be the rate
that, according to the Party‟s Schedule to Annex 2-A (Reduction or Elimination of Customs
Duties), would have been in effect but for the measure.
Article 7.3 : Provisional Measures
1. In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to
repair, a Party may apply a safeguard measure on a provisional basis pursuant to a
preliminary determination by its competent authorities that there is clear evidence that
imports of an originating good from the other Party have increased as the result of the
reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and such imports constitute
a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry.
2. Before a Party‟s competent authorities may make a preliminary determination, the
Party shall publish a public notice setting out how interested parties, including importers and
exporters, may obtain a non-confidential copy of the application requesting a provisional
safeguard measure, and shall provide interested parties at least 20 days after the date it
publishes the notice to submit evidence and views regarding the application of a provisional
measure. A Party may not apply a provisional measure until at least 45 days after the date its
competent authorities initiate an investigation.
3. The applying Party shall notify the other Party before applying a safeguard measure
on a provisional basis, and shall initiate consultations after applying the measure.
7-3
4. The duration of any provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time
the Party shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 7.2.
5. The Party shall promptly refund any tariff increase if the investigation described in
paragraph 2 of Article 7.2 does not result in a finding that the requirements of Article 7.1 are
met. The duration of any provisional measure shall be counted as part of the period described
in subparagraph 5(b) of Article 7.2.
Article 7.4 : Compensation
1. No later than 30 days after it applies a safeguard measure, a Party shall afford an
opportunity for the other Party to consult with it regarding appropriate trade liberalizing
compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or
equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the measure. The
applying Party shall provide such compensation as the Parties mutually agree.
2. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation through consultations under
paragraph 1 within 30 days after consultations begin, the Party against whose originating
good the measure is applied may suspend the application of concessions with respect to
originating goods of the applying Party that have trade effects substantially equivalent to the
safeguard measure.
3. The applying Party‟s obligation to provide compensation under paragraph 1 and the
other Party‟s right to suspend concessions under paragraph 2 shall terminate on the date the
safeguard measure terminates.
4. Any compensation shall be based on the total period of application of the provisional
safeguard measure and of the safeguard measure.
5. The right of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first
24 months during which a safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the safeguard
measure has been applied as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that the safeguard
measure conforms to the provisions of this Agreement.
Article 7.5 : Global Safeguard Measures
1. Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the
Safeguards Agreement. This Agreement does not confer any additional rights or obligations
on the Parties with regard to actions taken under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the
Safeguards Agreement, except that a Party taking a global safeguard measure may exclude
imports of an originating good of the other Party if such imports are not a substantial cause of
serious injury or threat thereof.
2. Upon request of the other Party, the Party intending to take safeguard measures shall
promptly provide written notification of all pertinent information on the initiation of a 
7-4
safeguard investigation, the preliminary determination and the final finding of the
investigation.
3. Neither Party may apply, with respect to the same good, at the same time:
(a) a safeguard measure; and
(b) a measure under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement.
Section B : Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duties
Article 7.6 : General Provisions
1. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, each Party retains its rights and
obligations under the WTO Agreement with regard to the application of anti-dumping and
countervailing duties.
2. The Parties shall ensure, immediately after any imposition of provisional measures
and in any case before the final determination, full and meaningful disclosure of all essential
facts and considerations which form the basis for the decision to apply measures, without
prejudice to Article 6.5 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and Article 12.4 of the SCM
Agreement. Disclosures shall be made in writing, and interested parties shall be allowed
sufficient time to make their comments.
3. The Parties shall observe the following practices in anti-dumping or countervailing
cases between them in order to enhance transparency in the implementation of the WTO
Agreement:
(a) when dumping margins are established, assessed, or reviewed under Articles 2,
9.3, 9.5, and 11 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement regardless of the comparison
bases under Article 2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, all individual
margins, whether positive or negative, should be counted toward the average;
(b) if a decision is taken to impose an anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 9.1 of
the Anti-Dumping Agreement, the Party taking such a decision may apply the
„lesser duty‟ rule, by imposing a duty which is less than the dumping margin
where such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic
industry; and
(c) the investigating Party shall request an exporter or producer in the territory of
the other Party for the timely response to its questionnaires. When the
investigating Party finds major deficiency in information in a questionnaire
response from relevant exporter or producer received before the deadline or
requires clarifications for the purposes of investigation, the investigating Party
shall demand missing information or request clarification of information
concerning the answers to the questionnaires. This procedure shall not be used 
7-5
to cause unwarranted delays in the investigation or to circumvent the deadlines
which are provided in the Party‟s domestic laws and regulations.
Article 7.7 : Notification and Consultations
1. Upon receipt by a Party‟s competent authorities of a properly documented antidumping application with respect to imports from the other Party, and no later than 15 days
before initiating an investigation, the Party shall provide written notification to the other
Party of its receipt of the application and afford the other Party a meeting or other similar
opportunities regarding the application, consistent with the Party‟s domestic laws and
regulations.
2. Upon receipt by a Party‟s competent authorities of a properly documented
countervailing duty application with respect to imports from the other Party, and before
initiating an investigation, the Party shall provide written notification to the other Party of its
receipt of the application and afford the other Party a meeting to consult with its competent
authorities regarding the application.
Article 7.8 : Undertakings
1. After a Party‟s competent authorities initiate an anti-dumping or countervailing duty
investigation, the Party shall transmit to the other Party‟s embassy or competent authorities
written information regarding the Party‟s procedures for requesting its authorities to consider
an undertaking on price including the timeframes for offering and concluding any such
undertaking if practicable.
2. In an anti-dumping investigation, where a Party‟s authorities have made a preliminary
affirmative determination of dumping and injury caused by such dumping, the Party shall
afford due consideration, and adequate opportunity for consultations, to exporters of the other
Party regarding proposed price undertakings which, if accepted, may result in suspension of
the investigation without imposition of anti-dumping duties, through the means provided for
in the Party‟s domestic laws, regulations and procedures.
3. In a countervailing duty investigation, where a Party‟s authorities have made a
preliminary affirmative determination of subsidization and injury caused by such
subsidization, the Party shall afford due consideration, and adequate opportunity for
consultations, to the other Party and exporters of the other Party, regarding proposed
undertakings on price, which, if accepted, may result in suspension of the investigation
without imposition of countervailing duties, through the means provided for in the Party‟s
domestic laws, regulations and procedures.
Article 7.9 : Investigation after Termination Resulting from a Review
The Parties agree to examine, with special care, any application for initiation of an antidumping investigation on a good originating in the other Party and on which anti-dumping
measures have been terminated in the previous 12 months as a result of a review. Unless this 
7-6
pre-initiation examination indicates that the circumstances have changed, the investigation
shall not proceed.
Article 7.10 : Cumulative Assessment
When imports from more than one country are simultaneously subject to anti-dumping or
countervailing duty investigation, a Party shall examine, with special care, whether the
cumulative assessment of the effect of the imports from the other Party is appropriate in light
of the conditions of competition between the imported goods and the conditions of
competition between the imported goods and the like domestic goods.
Section C : Committee on Trade Remedies
Article 7.11 : Committee on Trade Remedies
1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade Remedies (hereinafter referred to
as the “Committee”), comprising representatives at an appropriate level from relevant
agencies of each Party who have responsibility for trade remedies matters, including antidumping, subsidies and countervailing measures, and safeguards issues.
2. The functions of the Committee shall include:
(a) enhancing a Party‟s knowledge and understanding of the other Party‟s trade
remedies laws, regulations, policies and practices;
(b) overseeing the implementation of this Chapter;
(c) improving cooperation between the Parties‟ authorities having responsibility
for matters on trade remedies;
(d) providing a forum for the Parties to exchange information on issues relating to
anti-dumping, subsidies and countervailing measures and safeguards;
(e) providing a forum for the Parties to discuss other relevant topics of mutual
interest including:
(i) international issues relating to trade remedies, including issues relating
to the WTO Doha Round Rules negotiations; and
(ii) practices by the Parties‟ competent authorities in anti-dumping and
countervailing duty investigations such as the application of “facts
available” and verification procedures; and

entry of natural persons of the other Party into, or their temporary stay in, its territory,
including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly
movement of natural persons across, its borders, provided that such measures are not applied
in a manner to nullify or impair the benefits1
accruing to the other Party under the terms of a
specific commitment.
5. Articles 8.2 through 8.4 shall not apply to laws, regulations or requirements governing
the procurement by government agencies of services purchased for governmental purposes
and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the supply of services for
commercial sale.

In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule of Specific Commitments, and subject to any
conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord to services and service
suppliers of the other Party in respect of all measures affecting the supply of services,
treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own services and
service suppliers.
Article 8.3 : Most-Favored-Nation Treatment
1. If, after this Agreement enters into force, a Party enters into any agreement on trade in
services with a non-Party in which it provides treatment to services or service suppliers of
that non-Party more favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to services or
service suppliers of the other Party under this Agreement, the other Party may request
consultations to discuss the possibility of extending, under this Agreement, treatment no less
favorable than that provided under the agreement with the non-Party. The requested Party
shall enter into consultations with the requesting Party bearing in mind the overall balance of
benefits.
2. The treatment, as set out in paragraph 1, shall not include any preferential treatment
accorded to services or service suppliers under:
(a) any existing bilateral, regional or international agreements with any non-Party;
or
(b) any bilateral or plurilateral agreement among ASEAN Member States.
Article 8.4 : Market Access

1 The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall not be
regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under a specific commitment.
8-3
1. With respect to the market access through the modes of supply of trade in services
defined in Article 8.20, a Party shall accord services and service suppliers of the other Party
treatment no less favorable than that provided for under the terms, limitations and conditions
agreed and specified in its Schedule of Specific Commitments.
2
2. In sectors where market access commitments are undertaken, the measures which a
Party shall not adopt or maintain either on the basis of a regional subdivision or on the basis
of its entire territory, unless otherwise specified in its Schedule of Specific Commitments, are
defined as:

form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test;
(e) measures which restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture
through which a service supplier may supply a service; and
(f) limitations on the participation of foreign capital in terms of maximum
percentage limit on foreign shareholding or the total value of individual or

Article 8.5 : Additional Commitments
The Parties may negotiate commitments with respect to measures affecting trade in services
not subject to scheduling under Article 8.2 or 8.4, including those regarding qualifications,
standards or licensing matters. Such commitments shall be inscribed in a Party’s Schedule of
Specific Commitments.

2
If a Party undertakes a market access commitment relating to the supply of a service through the mode of
supply referred to in subparagraph (a) of “trade in services” defined in Article 8.20 and if the cross-border
movement of capital is an essential part of the service itself, that Party is thereby committed to allowing such
movement of capital. If a Party undertakes a market access commitment relating to the supply of a service
through the mode of supply referred to in subparagraph (c) of “trade in services” defined in Article 8.20, it is
thereby committed to allowing related transfers of capital into its territory.
3
 This subparagraph does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services.
8-4
Article 8.6 : Schedules of Specific Commitments
1. Each Party shall set out in a Schedule the Specific Commitments it undertakes under
Articles 8.2, 8.4, and 8.5. With respect to sectors where such commitments are undertaken,
each Schedule shall specify:
(a) terms, limitations and conditions on market access;

to inquiries from the other Party regarding its regulations of general
application relating to the subject matter of this Chapter;
(b) if, consistent with paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 14.1 (Publication), a Party
does not publish in advance, and provide opportunity for comment on,

matter of this Chapter, it shall, upon request in writing by the other Party,
address in writing, to the extent possible, the reasons for not doing so; and
(c) in accordance with its domestic laws and regulations, each Party shall allow a
reasonable period of time between publication of final regulations of general
application relating to the subject matter of this Chapter and their effective
date.
Article 8.8 : Domestic Regulation
8-5
1. In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that all
measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable,
objective and impartial manner.
2. (a) Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or
administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, upon request of an affected service
supplier, for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for,
administrative decisions affecting trade in services. Where such procedures are not
independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party
shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.
(b) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not be construed to require a Party to
institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional
structure or the nature of its legal system.
3. Where authorization is required for the supply of a service on which a specific
commitment has been made, the competent authorities of a Party shall, within a reasonable
period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under its domestic
laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application. Upon
request of the applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue
delay, information concerning the status of the application.
4. With a view to ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and
procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary
barriers to trade in services, the Joint Committee shall, through appropriate bodies it may
establish, develop any necessary disciplines. Such disciplines shall aim to ensure that such
requirements are, inter alia:
(a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability
to supply the service;
(b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service; and
(c) in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the
supply of the service.
5. (a) In sectors in which a Party has undertaken specific commitments, pending the
entry into force of disciplines developed in these sectors pursuant to paragraph
4, the Party shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and
technical standards that nullify or impair such specific commitments in a
manner which:
(i) does not comply with the criteria outlined in subparagraph 4(a), (b) or
(c); and
(ii) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the
specific commitments in those sectors were made.
8-6
(b) In determining whether a Party is in conformity with the obligation under
subparagraph (a), account shall be taken of international standards of relevant
international organizations4
applied by that Party.
6. In sectors where specific commitments regarding professional services are undertaken,
each Party shall provide for adequate procedures to verify the competence of professionals of
the other Party.
Article 8.9 : Recognition
1. For the purposes of fulfillment of its respective standards or criteria for the
authorization, licensing or certification of service suppliers, each Party may recognize the
education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in
the other Party. Such recognition, which may be achieved through harmonization or
otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement between the Parties or the
relevant competent bodies or may be accorded autonomously.
2. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in
paragraph 1, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party,
if the other Party is interested, to negotiate its accession to such an agreement or arrangement
or to negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it
shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that education,
experience, licenses, or certifications obtained or requirements met in the other Party’s
territory should be recognized.
3. A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of
discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or criteria for the
authorization, licensing or certification of service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade
in services.
4. Each Party shall endeavor:
(a) within 12 months from the date on which this Agreement enters into force, to
inform the Joint Committee of its existing recognition measures and state
whether such measures are based on the agreements or arrangements of the
type referred to in paragraph 1;
(b) to promptly inform the Joint Committee as far in advance as possible of the
opening of negotiations on an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to
in paragraph 1 in order to provide adequate opportunity to the other Party to
indicate its interest in participating in the negotiations before they enter a
substantive phase; and

4 The term "relevant international organizations" refers to international bodies whose membership is open to the
relevant bodies of at least all Members of the WTO.
8-7
(c) to promptly inform the Joint Committee when it adopts new recognition
measures or significantly modifies existing ones and state whether the
measures are based on an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in
paragraph 1.
5. Wherever appropriate, recognition should be based on multilaterally agreed criteria.
In appropriate cases, the Parties shall work in cooperation with relevant intergovernmental
and non-governmental organizations towards the establishment and adoption of common
international standards and criteria for recognition and common international standards for
the practice of relevant services trades and professions.
Article 8.10 : Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers
1. Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does
not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent
with that Party’s specific commitments under this Chapter.
2. Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated
juridical person, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which
is subject to that Party's specific commitments, the Party shall ensure that such a supplier
does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such
commitments.
3. If a Party has a reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of the other
Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, that Party may request the
other Party establishing, maintaining or authorizing such supplier to provide specific
information concerning the relevant operations.
4. This Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party,
formally or in effect:
(a) authorizes or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and
(b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.
Article 8.11 : Business Practices
1. The Parties recognize that certain business practices of service suppliers, other than
those falling under Article 8.10, may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in
services.
2. Each Party shall, upon request of the other Party (hereinafter referred to as the
“requesting Party”), enter into consultations with a view to eliminating practices referred to in
paragraph 1. The Party addressed (hereinafter referred to as the “requested Party”), shall
accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall cooperate through the
supply of publicly available non-confidential information of relevance to the matter in
question. The requested Party shall also provide other information available to the requesting 
8-8
Party, subject to its domestic laws and regulations and to the conclusion of satisfactory
agreement concerning the safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting Party.
Article 8.12 : Payments and Transfers5
1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 8.13, a Party shall not apply
restrictions on international transfers and payments for current transactions relating to its
specific commitments.
2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of any Party who is a
member of the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as “IMF”) under the
Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, including the use of exchange
actions which are in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary
Fund, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital transactions
inconsistently with its specific commitments regarding such transactions, except under
Article 8.13 or upon request of the IMF.
Article 8.13 : Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments
1. Where a Party is in serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties or
threat thereof, it may adopt or maintain restrictions on trade in services in accordance with
Article XII of GATS.
2. Any restriction adopted or maintained under paragraph 1, or any changes therein,
shall be promptly notified to the other Party.
Article 8.14 : Denial of Benefits
1. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter:
(a) to the supply of a service, if it establishes that the service is supplied from or
in the territory of a non-Party;

the service is supplied:
(i) by a vessel registered under the laws and regulations of a non-Party;
and
(ii) by a person of a non-Party which operates or uses the vessel in whole
or in part; and

5
For greater certainty, Annex 9-C (Transfers) shall apply to this Article.
8-9
(c) to a service supplier that is a juridical person, if it establishes that it is not a
service supplier of the other Party.
2. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier that is a juridical
person of the other Party:
(a) if the juridical person is owned or controlled by a person or persons of a nonParty and the denying Party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the
non-Party or a person or persons of the non-Party that prohibit transactions
with the juridical person or that would be violated or circumvented if the
benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the juridical person; or
(b) if the juridical person is owned or controlled by a person or persons of a nonParty or the denying Party and the juridical person has no substantial business
activities in the territory of the other Party.
3. The denying Party shall, to the extent practicable, notify the other Party before
denying the benefits. If the denying Party provides such notice, it shall consult with the other
Party upon the other Party’s request.
Article 8.15 : Consultations for Safeguard
In the event that the implementation of this Chapter causes substantial adverse impact to a
service sector of a Party, the affected Party may request consultations with the other Party for
the purposes of discussing any measure with respect to the affected service sector. Any
measure taken pursuant to this Article shall be mutually agreed by the Parties. The other
Party shall take into account the circumstances of the particular case and give sympathetic

and regulations. Korea may permit major suppliers to offer rates, terms, and conditions to non-facilities-based
suppliers of public telecommunications transport services that are less favorable than those offered to facilitiesbased suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services. For greater certainty, Korea shall
ensure that a non-facilities-based supplier of public telecommunications transport services may have recourse,
as provided in paragraph 13, to the telecommunications regulatory body regarding disputes over such rates,
terms, and conditions.

implementing measures that it has taken to comply with the determinations of the arbitration

sectors. The notification of such suspension pursuant to paragraph 2 shall
indicate the reasons on which it is based; and
(c) the level of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be equivalent to the
level of the nullification or impairment.

aware of any such interests, relationships and matters.

aware of any interests, relationships or matters referred to in paragraph 2 and shall disclose
them. The obligation to disclose is a continuing duty which requires an arbitrator to disclose

(Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures), 4 (Customs Administration and Trade Facilitation),
5 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), 6 (Technical Barriers to Trade), and 7 (Trade
Remedies), Article XX of GATT 1994 and its interpretative notes are incorporated into and
made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.
2. For the purposes of Chapters 8 (Trade in Services) and 9 (Investment), Article XIV of
GATS (including its footnotes) is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis
mutandis.
Article 16.2 : Security Exceptions
1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to:
(a) require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it
considers contrary to its essential security interests;
(b) prevent a Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the
protection of its essential security interests:
(i) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war
and to such traffic in other goods and materials or relating to the
supply of services as carried on, directly or indirectly, for the
purposes of supplying or provisioning a military establishment;
(ii) relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials from
which they are derived;

communications, power and water infrastructures, from deliberate
attempts intended to disable or degrade such infrastructure; or
(iv) taken in time of domestic emergency, or war or other emergency in
international relations; or
(c) prevent a Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under
the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and
security.
2. The Joint Committee shall be informed to the fullest extent possible of measures

16-2
Article 16.3 : Taxation
1. Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation
measures.
2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of either Party under
any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such
convention, that convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. In the case of a
tax convention between Korea and Viet Nam, the competent authorities under that
convention shall have sole responsibility for jointly determining whether any inconsistency
exists between this Agreement and that convention.
3. Paragraph 2 of Article 16.1 shall apply to taxation measures1
.
4. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, Article 2.2(National Treatment on Internal Taxation
and Regulation) and such other provisions of this Agreement as are necessary to give effect
to that Article shall apply to taxation measures to the same extent as does Article III of GATT
1994.
5. Subparagraph 4(h) of Article 9.8(Transfers) shall apply to taxation measures.
6. The determination of whether a taxation measure, in a specific fact situation,
constitutes an expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers all
relevant factors relating to the investment, including the factors listed in Annex 9-B
(Expropriation) and the following considerations:
(a) the imposition of taxes does not generally constitute an expropriation. The
mere introduction of a new taxation measure or the imposition of a taxation
measure in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment generally
does not in and of itself constitute an expropriation;
(b) a taxation measure that is consistent with internationally recognized tax
policies, principles, and practices does not constitute an expropriation. In
particular, a taxation measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of
taxation measures generally does not constitute an expropriation;
(c) a taxation measure that is applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to
a taxation measure that is targeted at investors of a particular nationality or at
specific taxpayers, is less likely to constitute an expropriation; and
(d) a taxation measure does not constitute an expropriation if it was already in
force when the investment was made and information about the measure was
publicly available.

1
For the purposes of this paragraph, the application of paragraph 2 of Article 16.1 to taxation measures refers to
Article XIV (d) and (e) of GATS.
16-3
7. (a) No investor may invoke Article 9.7(Expropriation and Compensation) as the
basis for a claim where it has been determined pursuant to this subparagraph that the measure
is not an expropriation. An investor that seeks to invoke Article 9.7(Expropriation and
Compensation) with respect to a taxation measure must first provide written request to the
competent authorities, at the time that it gives its Notice of Intent under Article 9.17(Notice
of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration), for decision on the issue of whether taxation
measure is not an expropriation. The request should include the Notice of Intent. If the
competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail
to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of such
referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under paragraph 1 of Article
9.19(Submission of a Claim to Arbitration).
(b) For the purposes of this paragraph, competent authorities means:
(i) for Korea, the Deputy Minister for Tax and Customs, Ministry of
Strategy and Finance; and
(ii) for Viet Nam, the Director General of the General Department of
Taxation, Ministry of Finance;
or their respective successors.
8. For the purposes of this Article:
(a) tax convention means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or
other international taxation agreement or arrangement; and
(b) taxes and taxation measures do not include customs duties as defined in
Article 1.5(General Definitions) and measures listed in exceptions (b), (c), (d),
and (e) of that definition.
Article 16.4 : Disclosure of Information
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to
confidential information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or
otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate
commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.
