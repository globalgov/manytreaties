3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to impose an obligation on a Party to privatize any investment owned or controlled by it or to prohibit a Party from designating a monopoly, provided that, if a Party adopts or maintains a measure to privatize such an investment or a measure to designate a monopoly, this Chapter shall apply to such measure.

(1) For greater certainty, this Chapter is subject to and shall be interpreted in accordance with Annexes 14-A to14-D.
Article 14.2. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER CHAPTERS
1. In case of incompatibility between this Chapter and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail.

2. A Party's requirement that a service supplier of the other Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition for supplying a service in its territory does not, of itself, make this Chapter applicable to the supply of that cross-border service. This Chapter shall apply to that Party's treatment of the bond or financial security provided if the bond or financial security is a covered investment.

3. This Chapter shall not apply to a measure adopted or maintained by a Party if such measure is covered by Chapter 16 (Financial Services).

4. Articles 15.4 (Market Access) and 15.7 (Domestic Regulation) are incorporated into and made part of this Chapter, and apply to a measure adopted or maintained by a Party if that measure affects the supply of a service in its territory by a covered investment.

5. A reservation made by a Party under Article 15.6 (Non-Conforming Measures) with respect to Article 15.4 (Market Access) shall apply to a measure of that Party covered in paragraph 4.

Article 14.3. NATIONAL TREATMENT

2. Each Party shall accord to a covered investment treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of an investment in its territory.

Article 14.4. MOST-FAVORED-NATION TREATMENT
1.

Article 14.5. MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT  (2)
1. Each Party shall accord to a covered investment treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens is the minimum standard of treatment to be accorded to covered investments. The concepts of "fair and equitable treatment" and "full protection and security" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that required by the minimum standard of treatment of foreigners under customary international law and do not create additional substantive rights.

3. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide "fair and equitable treatment" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative litigation proceedings, in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the world's principal legal systems; and the obligation to provide "full protection and security" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection that is required by customary international law.

4. A determination that another provision of this Agreement, or of another international agreement, has been violated does not establish that this Article has been violated.

5. For greater certainty, "fair and equitable treatment" shall not be interpreted as preventing a Party from exercising its regulatory power.
Article 14.6. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
1. A Party may not impose or enforce the following requirements or apply any commitment or obligation in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct or operation, or sale of a covered investment of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory (3):

(b) if the requirement is imposed or the commitment or obligation is ordered by a judicial or administrative tribunal or competent authority to resolve an alleged violation of domestic competition law (5).

(c) subparagraphs 3(a) and (b) do not apply to a requirement imposed by an importing Party with respect to the content of a good necessary to qualify for a preferential tariff or quota.

9. Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustified manner, or do not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in subparagraphs 1(b), (c) and (f), and subparagraphs 3(a) and (b) shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures, including those of an environmental nature:

(a) necessary to ensure compliance with laws and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement;

(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; or

(c) relating to the preservation of living or non-living non-renewable natural resources.

(3) For greater certainty, a condition for the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage referred to in paragraph 3 does not constitute an "obligation or commitment" for purposes of paragraph 1.
(4) For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation or sale or other disposition of a covered investment of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, from imposing or enforcing a requirement or enforcing an obligation or commitment to train workers in its territory.
(5) The Parties recognize that a patent does not necessarily confer market power.
Article 14.7. SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND BOARDS OF DIRECTORS
1. No Party may require an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment to appoint natural persons of a particular nationality to senior management positions.

2. No Party may require that a majority of the members of the board of directors, or a committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment be ofa particular nationality or be a resident of the territory of the Party, provided that the requirement does not significantly impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its investment.

(a) an existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party at the level:

2. Compensation under paragraph 1 should be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"), and should not reflect any change in value because the intention to expropriate was known in advance of the date of expropriation. In determining fair market value, a Tribunal will use appropriate valuation criteria which may include going concern value, valuation of assets including the value of the tax declared for tangible property, or other valuation criteria.

3. Compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall be fully liquidable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be paid in a freely convertible currency and shall include interest at a commercial rate fixed according to market criteria for such currency from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.

2. Paragraph 1 does not apply to existing measures relating to grants or donations that are inconsistent with the provisions of Article 14.3, with the exception of Article 14.8.4(b).

Article 14.12. SUBROGATION
1.

The subrogated right or claim may not be greater than the original right or claim of the investor.

2. A Party or an entity of a Party that has subrogated itself to a right of an investor in accordance with paragraph 1 shall have the same rights as the investor with respect to the investment. These rights may be exercised by the Party or one of its entities, or by the investor if the Party or entity so authorizes.

Article 14.13. DENIAL OF BENEFITS
A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of that Party and to investments of that investor, if investors of a non-Party or of the denying Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise does not have substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is incorporated or organized.

Article 14.14. MEASURES RELATED TO HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND LABOR RIGHTS
The Parties recognize that it is not appropriate to encourage investment by diminishing their domestic health, safety, environmental or labor measures. Accordingly, a Party should not exempt or derogate from or refrain from applying such measures, or offer to exempt or refrain from applying such measures as a means of encouraging the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an investor's investment.

Article 14.15. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

These principles address issues such as environmental and human rights, community relations and anti-corruption.

Article 14.16. SPECIAL FORMALITIES AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
1. Article 14.3 shall not prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities relating to the establishment of a covered investment, such as a requirement that an investor's agent be a resident of the Party or that the covered investment be constituted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Party, provided that such formalities do not significantly impair the protection afforded by a Party to investors of the other Party and to covered investments under this Chapter.

2. Notwithstanding Article 14.3 or 14.4, a Party may require an investor of the other Party, or its covered investment, to provide routine information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes. The Party shall protect any confidential information that, if disclosed, could prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the covered investment. This paragraph shall not prevent a Party from obtaining or disclosing information relating to the equitable and good faith application of its laws.

Article 14.20. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE SUBMISSION OF a COMPLAINT TO THE ARBITRATION
1. In the case of administrative acts, in order to submit a claim to the domestic forum or to the arbitration provided for in this Article, it shall be indispensable to previously exhaust governmental proceedings when the law of the disputing Party so requires. Such exhaustion may in no case exceed a period of six months from the date of its initiation by the investor and shall not prevent the investor from requesting the consultations referred to in Article 14.17(2).
