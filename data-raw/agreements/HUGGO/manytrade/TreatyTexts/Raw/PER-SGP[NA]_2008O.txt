proposed  verification visit, for a  period  not exceeding  sixty (60) days. This extension shall be  notified  to  the  competent  authorities of the 
importing and exporting Parties.
7. A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good solely 
because a verification visit was postponed pursuant to paragraph 6.

goods at the  time  of importation, the  goods may be  released  by the 
customs administration of the  importing  Party on a security or upon 
payment of duties, pending  the  outcome  of the  origin  verification, provided  that  they are  not  held  to  be  subject to  import prohibition or
restriction and  there  is no suspicion of fraud.  The  relevant duties paid 
shall be refunded  once the  outcome  of the  origin verification confirmed 
that the good qualifies as an originating good.

subsequent  import  of a  good when the  competent  authority had  already 
determined that an identical good was not eligible for that treatment.

Certification of Origin and  has reason to  believe that such Certification 
contains or is based  on incorrect  information, the  exporter or producer
shall promptly notify in writing  every person to  whom the  exporter or
producer provided  the Certification of any change  that  could  affect the 
accuracy or validity of the Certification. Any penalty, if applicable,  for
providing  an  incorrect  Certification of Origin  for preferential tariff
treatment shall be subject to the domestic law of each Party that is dealing 
with the offence under its jurisdiction.

from its own technical regulations, provided  that the  said  technical 
regulations produce the  outcomes, equivalent to  those  produced  by its
own technical regulations, in  meeting  the  legitimate  objectives, or
achieving the same level of protection.
2. For this purpose,  a  Party seeking the  other  Party to  accept its
technical regulation as equivalent, shall provide, as appropriate: 
(a)  information on the relationship  of its technical regulation 
to international standards referenced  in  the technical 
regulation of the other Party;

assessment procedures conducted  in another  Party’s territory, for
example: 
(a)  the importing Party may rely on a supplier’s declaration of
conformity; 
(b) the  Parties’ conformity assessment bodies may enter  into 
voluntary arrangements to accept the  results of each 
other´s conformity assessment procedures;

assessment bodies located in the other Party’s territory; 
(d) a Party may adopt accreditation procedures for qualifying 
conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the 
other Party; 
(e)  a  Party may designate  conformity assessment bodies
located in the territory of the other Party; and 
(f) a  Party may unilaterally recognize the  results of
conformity assessment procedures conducted  in the 
territory of the  other  Party with respect to a  sector
nominated by other Party.
The  Parties shall intensify their exchange  of information  on these  and 
other similar mechanisms, so as to facilitate the acceptance of results of
conformity assessment procedures.

of the other Party, explain its decision, so that the affected Party may take
corrective action.
3. Each Party shall accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize
conformity assessment bodies in the territory of the other Party on terms
no less favorable than those it accords to conformity assessment bodies in 
its territory. Where  a  Party accredits, approves, licenses or otherwise 
recognizes a body assessing conformity with  a  specific technical 
regulation or standard  in its territory and  refuses to accredit, approve,
license  or otherwise  recognize  a  body assessing  conformity with  that 
technical regulation or standard in the territory of the other Party, it shall,
on request of that other Party, explain the reasons for its decision so that 
the other Party may take corrective action.
4. Where  a  Party refuses an application from the  other  Party to 
engage or conclude negotiations to reach an agreement that facilitates the

tariff, technical characteristics and uses, as well as a  brief
description of its production process; 
(d) information relative  to the  increased  imports (volume,

concerned, in absolute terms, as well as in relation to total 
import, and relative to domestic industry for the last thirty­ six (36) months for which official statistics are available; 
(e)  evidence  enabling the  evaluation of the existence  of
serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by the imports of
the good concerned, for the last thirty­six (36) months for
which information is available, such as: 
(i) a description of the serious injury, or threat thereof; 
(ii) information relative  to production, sales in  the 
domestic  market and  foreign sales, capacity and 
capacity utilization, productivity, employment,
inventories of the  domestic  industry, of the like  or
directly competitive good or goods; 
(iii) the  production cost  structure  of the  domestic 
industry for the  good  or the  like  or directly

costs of the imported  good  enabling a reasonable 
comparison between the price of the domestic and 
imported  good  in  the  same  level of
commercialization; and 
(vi) any other information that supports the application 
of the safeguard measure; 
(f) an enumeration  and  description  of alleged  causes of the

classification, the  deadline  for the  final determination, and the  name, 
address, telephone and  electronic mail  address of the  competent 
investigating authority.
Confidential Information
4. Any information provided  by the  parties to an investigation 
classified as confidential, subject to prior justification, will be treated as
such by the competent investigating authority. Information which shall be 
considered confidential due to its nature includes such information which,
if disclosed, would  provide  a  significant advantage for a competitor, commercial or otherwise, or could have a significantly negative impact on 
the person providing the information, in accordance with the provisions of
each Party’s domestic legislation.
Evidence of Injury and Causation
5. For the purpose of determining the serious injury, or threat thereof,
to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the 
competent investigating  authority shall analyze, among  other  matters,
information relative  to  the  increased  imports of the  good  under 
investigation, in absolute  and  relative  terms, the share  of the  domestic 
market taken by the  increased  imports, the  changes in the  sales, production and  productivity levels, the  utilization of capacity, exports, changes in  prices and  inventories, capital generating  capacity, profits or
losses, wages and employment. None of these isolated factors, nor several 
of them in  conjunction, will necessarily be  sufficient for reaching a 
decisive conclusion.
6. The  competent investigating  authority shall  not make an 
affirmative  determination of serious injury, or threat thereof, unless the 
investigation demonstrates, on the  basis of objective  evidence, the 
existence of a  clear causal link  between increased  imports of the  good 
concerned and serious injury, or threat thereof. Where factors other than
increased imports are causing injury to the domestic industry at the same 
time, such injury shall not be attributed to increased imports.
Deliberation and Report
7. Before  making  an affirmative  determination in a  safeguard 
procedure under this Chapter, the competent investigating authority shall 
have  a maximum term of six (6) months, commencing from the date of
initiation of the  procedure,  to gather, receive,  examine  and  verify the 
relevant information, hold a public  hearing, and  provide the opportunity 
for all interested parties to prepare and submit their views, and prepare the 
corresponding report.
8. The  report  shall contain all relevant information, including 
evidence  of serious injury, or threat thereof, caused  by the increased 
imports, the precise description of the good concerned and the measure to 
be  adopted, the  proposed  date  for the  introduction of the  measure, its
expected  duration and, if applied,  the  schedule  for its progressive 
liberalization.
ARTICLE 8.5: NOTIFICATION AND CONSULTATION 
1. A Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing upon: 
(a)  initiating a safeguard procedure under this Chapter,
(b) adopting a provisional safeguard measure under Article 8.7 
(Provisional Safeguards); or
(c)  adopting the determination to apply or extend a safeguard 
measure.
2. On request of a  Party whose  good  is subject to a  safeguard 
procedure  under  this Chapter, the  Party conducting  that procedure shall 
enter into consultations with the other Party to review a notification under 
paragraph 1 or any public notice or report that the competent investigating 
authority has issued in connection with the procedure.
ARTICLE 8.6 : GLOBAL ACTIONS 
1. Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of
GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.
2. This Agreement does not confer  any additional rights or
obligations upon the  Parties regarding  actions taken pursuant  to  Article 
XIX  of GATT 1994  and  the  WTO  Agreement on Safeguards. When a 
Party decides to adopt a safeguard  measure  in  accordance with Article
XIX of GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, that Party 
may exclude imports of an originating good from the other Party if such 
imports are not a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof.
3. Where the Party’s imports represent less than 5  per  cent (5%) of
the  total volume  of imports of that good, such imports shall not be 
considered part of the substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof.
4. No Party may apply, with respect to the same  good, at the same 
time: 
(a)  a safeguard measure under this Chapter; and 
(a)  a measure under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the WTO 
Agreement on Safeguards.
ARTICLE: 8.7 :  PROVISIONAL SAFEGUARDS 
1. In critical circumstances where any delay may result in irreparable 
injury  to  a  domestic  industry producing  a  like  or directly competitive 
good, the Party applying a safeguard measure in accordance with Article 
8.2  (Imposition of a  Safeguard  Measure)  may adopt a  provisional 
safeguard  measure  pursuant to a  preliminary determination  that  clear 
evidence exists demonstrating that the increased imports of the  imported 
good  have  caused,  or threaten to cause,  serious injury to a  domestic 
industry producing a like or directly competitive good. Immediately after 
adopting  the provisional safeguard  measure,  the affected  Party  may 
request consultations in  accordance with  paragraph 2  of Article  8.5 
(Notification and Consultation).
2. A provisional safeguard measure may take any of the forms set out 
in  paragraph 2  of Article  8.2 (Imposition of a Safeguard Measure). The

and  eighty (180) days. Where the  competent investigating authority has
determined that increased imports have not caused or threatened to cause 
serious injury to the  domestic  industry producing  a  like  or directly 
competitive good, the guarantees or the perceived funds arising from the 
imposition of provisional measures shall  be promptly  released  or
refunded, as the case may be. 
ARTICLE 8.8 : COMPENSATION 
1. A Party applying  a safeguard  measure  for an  overall period 
beyond two (2) years shall, in consultation with the other Party, provide 
mutually­agreed  trade liberalizing  compensation in the  form of
concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to
the  value  of the additional duties expected  to result from the  measure 
during the period of extension of the measure beyond the aforementioned 
two (2) years. The  Party  applying  the safeguard  measure shall  provide 
opportunity for such consultations no later than thirty (30) days after the 
decision to extend the measure. Such consultations shall take place prior
to the effective date of the extension.
2. If the  Parties are  unable  to reach  agreement  on compensation 
within  thirty (30) days of the  commencement of consultations, the 
exporting  Party may suspend  the  application of substantially equivalent 
concessions to the trade of the Party applying the safeguard measure. 
3. The exporting Party shall notify the other Party in writing in the 
English language at least thirty (30) days before suspending concessions

3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to customs
duties and  charges of any kind  imposed  on or in connection with

than laws, regulations, procedures and  practices regarding  government 
procurement covered by this Chapter.
ARTICLE 9.5 : VALUATION OF PROCUREMENTS 
The following provisions shall apply in determining the value of a 
procurement for purposes of implementing this Chapter: 
(a)  valuation shall take into account all forms of remuneration,
including  any premiums, fees, commissions and interest

(b) the selection of a valuation method by a government body 
shall not be made, nor shall any procurement requirement 
be  divided, with the  intention of avoiding the  application 
of this Chapter; and 
(c)  in cases where an intended procurement specifies the need 
for option clauses, the basis for valuation shall be the total 
value of the maximum permissible procurement, inclusive 
of optional purchases.
ARTICLE 9.6 : RULES OF ORIGIN 
For the  purposes of covered  procurement, no Party may apply 
rules of origin to goods imported or supplied from the other Party that are 
different from the rules of origin the Party applies at the same time in the
normal course of trade to imports or supplies of the same goods from the 
same Party.
ARTICLE 9.7 : OFFSETS 
A procuring entity shall not impose, seek or consider offsets in the 
qualification and  selection of suppliers, goods or services, or in the

ARTICLE 9.8  :  PUBLICATION  OF  INFORMATION  ON  PROCUREMENT
MEASURES 
Each Party shall promptly publish any  law, regulation, judicial 
decision, administrative  ruling  of general application, procedure 
(including standard contract clauses), and any modifications or additions
to  this information  regarding  government procurement covered  by this
Chapter, in an officially designated electronic medium listed in Annex 9B
(Officially Designated  Electronic  Media  for the  Publication of
Information on  Government  Procurement), and  in such a  manner  as to 
enable  the  other  Party and  suppliers to become acquainted  with them. Each Party shall be prepared, upon request, to explain such information to 
the other Party.
ARTICLE 9.9 : PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF INTENDED PROCUREMENT
1. For each procurement covered by this Chapter, a procuring entity

as otherwise provided in Article 9.13. This notice shall be published in an 
officially designated  electronic  medium  listed  in Annex  9B (Officially 
Designated  Electronic  Media  for the  Publication of Information on 
Government Procurement). Each such notice shall be  accessible during 
the entire period established for tendering for the relevant procurement.
2. Each notice of intended procurement shall include a description of
the  intended  procurement, any conditions that suppliers must fulfil  to 
participate  in the procurement, the  name  of the  procuring  entity issuing 
the  notice, the  address and contact where  suppliers  may obtain all 
documents relating to the procurement, the time limits for submission of
tenders and the dates for delivery of the goods or services to be procured.
3. Each Party shall encourage its procuring  entities to publish, as
early as possible  in  the fiscal year, information regarding  the  procuring 
entity’s indicative procurement plans published in an officially designated 
electronic medium listed  in Annex 9B (Officially Designated Electronic 
Media for the Publication of Information on Government Procurement). Where  such information is published,  a  procuring  entity may apply
Article 9.10 (Time Limits for the Tendering Process) for the purpose of
establishing shorter time limits for tendering.
ARTICLE 9.10 : TIME LIMITS FOR THE TENDERING PROCESS
1. A  procuring  entity shall prescribe  time  limits for the  tendering 
process that allows sufficient time  for suppliers to prepare  and submit 
responsive tenders, taking into account the nature and complexity of the 
procurement. A  procuring  entity shall provide  no less than  twenty­one 
(21) days between the date on which it publishes the  notice of intended 
procurement and the deadline for submitting tenders.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph  1, where  there  are  no qualification 
requirements for suppliers, a procuring entity may establish a time limit of
less than twenty­one (21) days, but in no case less than ten (10) days, in 
the following circumstances: 
(a)  where the procuring entity has published a separate notice 
containing  the  information specified  in  paragraph 3  of
Article  9.9  (Publication of Notice  of Intended 
Procurement) in an officially designated electronic medium 
listed  in  Annex  9B (Officially Designated  Electronic 
Media for the Publication  of Information  on Government 
Procurement) at least  twenty­one (21) days and not more 
than twelve (12) months in advance; 
(b) in  the  case  of the  second  or subsequent publication of
notices for procurement of a recurring nature; 
(c)  where a  state  of urgency duly substantiated  by the 
procuring  entity renders the  time  limit specified  in 
paragraph 1 impracticable; or
(d) where  the  procuring  entity has published  a  notice of
intended procurement  by electronic means in an officially 
designated  electronic  medium listed  in  Annex 9B
(Officially Designated  Media  for the  Publication of
Information on Government Procurement).
ARTICLE 9.11  :  TENDER DOCUMENTATION  AND  TECHNICAL 
SPECIFICATIONS
Tender Documentation
1. A  procuring  entity shall provide  interested suppliers with tender 
documentation that includes all the information necessary to permit 
suppliers to prepare  and submit responsive  tenders.  The  documentation 
shall include  all the  criteria  that the  procuring  entity will consider  in
awarding  the  contract, including  all cost factors, and  the  weights or, where appropriate, the relative values that the procuring entity will assign 
to these criteria in evaluating tenders.
2. To the  extent possible,  a  procuring  entity should make  available 
relevant tender  documentation on the internet or a  comparable  publicly 
available computer­based telecommunications network openly accessible 
to all suppliers. Where a procuring entity does not publish all the tender 
documentation by electronic  means, the  entity shall, on request of any 
supplier, promptly make the  documentation available  in written form to 
the supplier.
Technical Specifications
3. Technical specifications laying  down  the  characteristics of the 
goods or services to be procured shall not be prepared, adopted or applied 
with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to 
trade between the Parties.
4. Technical specifications prescribed  by a  procuring  entity shall, where appropriate, be: 
(a)  expressed  in terms of performance requirements rather 
than design or descriptive characteristics; and 
(b) based  on  international standards, where  applicable; 
otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognized 
national standards or building codes.
5. There  shall be  no requirement or reference  to  a  particular 
trademark  or trade name,  patent, design  or type, specific origin  or
producer or supplier unless there is no sufficiently precise or intelligible 
way of otherwise describing the procurement requirements and provided 
that, in such cases, words such as “or equivalent”  are  included  in the 
tender documentation.
6. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would 
have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the 
preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a  specific 
procurement from a person that may have  a  commercial interest in that 
procurement.
7. Where, during  the  course  of a  procurement, a  procuring  entity 
modifies any part of the tender documentation referred to in paragraph 1,
including the criteria or technical requirements thereof, it shall transmit all 
such modifications in writing: 
(a)  to all suppliers that are participating in the procurement at 
the time the criteria was modified, if the identities of such
suppliers are  known, and  in  all other  cases, in the same 
manner the original information was transmitted; and 
(b) in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and re­ 
submit their tenders, as appropriate. 
ARTICLE 9.12 : QUALIFICATION OF SUPPLIERS 
1. In the process of qualifying suppliers, a procuring entity shall not 
discriminate between domestic suppliers and suppliers of the other Party.
2. Any conditions for participation  in  open tendering  procedures
shall be no less favourable to suppliers of the other Party than to domestic 
suppliers.
3. The  process of, and  the  time  required  for, registering  and/or
qualifying suppliers shall not be used in order to  exclude suppliers of the 
other  Party, or from being  considered  for a  particular  intended 
procurement.
4. Qualification procedures shall be consistent with the following: 
(a)  Any condition  for participation  in  the  procurement,
including financial guarantees, technical qualifications and 
information necessary for establishing the legal, financial, commercial and technical capacity of suppliers, as well as
the verifications of qualifications, shall be limited to those 
which are essential to ensure the firm’s capability to fulfil 
the  contract  in question. The  legal, financial, commercial 
and technical capacity of a supplier shall be judged both on 
the basis of that supplier’s global business activity and its
activity in the territory of the  procuring  entity taking  due 
account of the  legal relationship  between the supply 
organizations.
(b) A  procuring  entity shall promptly communicate  to any 
supplier  that has applied  for qualification its decision on 
whether that supplier is qualified. Where a procuring entity 
rejects an application for qualification or ceases to 
recognize a  supplier as qualified,  that  procuring  entity 
shall, on request of the supplier, promptly provide it with a 
written explanation.
5. Nothing  in  this Article  shall preclude  a  procuring  entity from 
excluding a supplier from a procurement on grounds such as bankruptcy 
or false declaration, provided  that such  an action is consistent with the 
national treatment provisions of this Chapter.
ARTICLE 9.13 : LIMITED TENDERING PROCEDURES 
1. A  procuring  entity  shall award  contracts by means of open 
tendering procedures, in the course of which any interested supplier may 
submit a tender.
2. Provided  that the  tendering  procedure  is not  used  to avoid 
competition or to protect domestic  suppliers, a procuring  entity  may 
award  contracts by means other  than open tendering  procedures in the 
following circumstances, where applicable: 
(a)  when no tenders were  submitted  in response  to  a  prior
notice or invitation  to  participate,  or in the  absence of
tenders that conform to the  essential requirements in  the 
tender  documentation provided  in a  prior invitation to 
tender, including any conditions for participation, on 
condition that the requirements of the  initial procurement 
are not substantially modified in the contract as awarded; 
(b) when, for works of art, or for reasons connected with the 
protection of exclusive  rights, such as patents or
copyrights, or proprietary information, or where there is an 
absence of competition for technical reasons, the goods or
services can be supplied only by a particular supplier  and 
no reasonable alternative or substitute exists; 
(c)  for additional deliveries by the  original supplier that are 
intended  either  as replacement parts, extensions, or
continuing  services for existing equipment, software,
services or installations, where a change of supplier would 
compel the  procuring  entity to procure  goods or services
not meeting  requirements of interchangeability with 
existing equipment, software, services, or installations; 
(d) for goods purchased on a commodity market; 
(e)  when  a  procuring  entity procures a  prototype  or a  first 
good  or service  that is developed  at its request in the 
course  of, and  for, a  particular  contract for research, experiment, study or original development. When such 
contracts have been fulfilled, subsequent procurements of
such goods or services shall be subject to the principles and 
procedures laid down in this Chapter; 
(f) where  additional construction services that were  not 
included  in  the  initial contract but that were  within  the 
objectives of the original tender documentation  have, due 
to unforeseeable circumstances, become  necessary to 
complete  the  construction services described therein. However, the  total value  of contracts awarded  for
additional construction services may not exceed  50  per 
cent (50%) of the amount of the initial contract; 
(g) for new construction services consisting of the repetition of
similar services which conform to a basic project for which 
an initial contract was awarded  following  an open 
procurement method, and  for which the  procuring  entity 
has indicated  in the  notice of intended  procurement 
concerning  the  initial service, that a  limited  procurement 
method might be used in awarding contracts for such new 
services; 
(h) in  so far  as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of
extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by 
the  procuring  entity, the  goods or services could  not  be 
obtained in time by means of an open tendering procedure 
and the use of an open tendering procedure would result in 
serious injury to the  procuring  entity, or the  procuring 
entity's program responsibilities or the Party; 
(i) for purchases made under  exceptionally advantageous
conditions which only arise  in  the very short term in  the 
case  of unusual disposals such as those  arising  from 
liquidation, receivership or bankruptcy and not for routine 
purchases from regular suppliers; or
(j) in the case of a contract awarded to a winner of a design 
contest, provided that: 
(i) the contest has been organized in a manner that is
consistent with the  principles of this Chapter, notably as regards the  publication of a  notice of
intended procurement; and 
(ii) the participants are judged by an independent jury 
with a view to a design contract being awarded to a 
winner.
3. A  procuring  entity shall maintain  a  record  or prepare  a  written 
report on the  contract  awarded  under  these  provisions, containing  the 
name  of the  procuring  entity, the  value  and  kind  of goods or services
procured, and the specific justifications for use of tender procedures other 
than open tendering procedures, as provided in paragraph 2.
ARTICLE 9.14 : EVALUATION OF TENDERS 
The tender evaluation process shall be fair and non­discriminatory, and shall have a mechanism to eliminate any potential conflict of interest
between persons administering the process and suppliers participating in 
the process.
ARTICLE 9.15 : INFORMATION ON AWARDS 
1. Subject to Article  9.21  (Non­Disclosure of Information), a 
procuring  entity shall promptly inform suppliers participating in  a 
tendering  procedure  of its contract award  decision. The  award notice
should include at least the following information: 
(a)  the name of the procuring entity; 
(b) a description of the goods or services procured; 
(c)  the name of the winning supplier; 
(d) the date of award; 
(e)  the value of the contract award; and 
(f) where the procuring entity has not used an open tendering 
procedure, an indication of the circumstances according to 
Article 9.13 (Limited Tendering Procedures) justifying the 
procedures used. 
2. A procuring entity shall, on request from an unsuccessful supplier 
of the  other  Party which participated  in the  relevant tender, promptly 
provide  pertinent information concerning reasons for the rejection of its
tender, unless the  release  of such information would  impede law 
enforcement or otherwise be  contrary to the  public  interest or would 
prejudice the legitimate  commercial interest of particular  enterprises, public or private, or might prejudice fair competition between suppliers. 
ARTICLE 9.16 : MODIFICATIONS AND RECTIFICATIONS TO COVERAGE
1. Each Party may make rectifications of a purely formal nature to its
coverage  under  this Chapter, or minor amendments to  its Schedules in 
Annex 9A (Government Procurement Schedules), provided that it notifies
the other Party in writing and that Party does not object in writing within 
thirty (30) days of the  notification. A Party that makes such a 
rectification or minor amendment need  not provide  compensatory 
adjustments to the other Party.
2. Where a Party proposes to make a modification to its Schedules in 
Annex 9A (Government Procurement  Schedules) when the  business or
commercial operations or functions of any of its procuring entities or part 
thereof is constituted  or established  as an  enterprise  with  a legal entity 
separate  and distinct from the  Government of a  Party, regardless of
whether or not the Government holds any shares or interest in such a legal 
entity, it shall notify the  other  Party. The  proposed removal of such an 
entity or modification shall become effective  thirty (30) days from the 
date of notification. The other Party shall not be entitled to compensatory 
adjustments.
ARTICLE 9.17 : TRANSPARENCY 
The  Parties shall apply all procurement laws, regulations, procedures and  practices consistently, fairly and equitably so that their
corporate governance structures provide  transparency to potential 
suppliers.
ARTICLE 9.18 : ELECTRONIC PROCUREMENT

of enabling suppliers to access information on procurement opportunities
in its territory.
3. Each Party shall, to the  extent possible,  make  procurement 
opportunities that are available to the public accessible to suppliers via the 
internet or a  comparable  publicly available  computer­based 
telecommunications network  openly accessible to all suppliers.  To the 
extent possible,  each Party shall make  available relevant documentation 
by the same means.
4. For the purposes of this Chapter, the Parties shall endeavour to use 
English as the language for publishing the notice for each case of intended 
procurement. The notice shall contain at least the following information: 
(a)  the subject matter of the contract; 
(b) the time­limits set for the submission of tenders; and 
(c)  the  addresses and  contact from which documents relating 
to the contracts may be requested. 
ARTICLE 9.19 : CHALLENGE PROCEDURES 
1. In the event of a complaint by a supplier of a Party that there has
been a breach of this Chapter in the context of procurement by the other
Party, that Party may encourage the supplier to first seek resolution of its
complaint in consultation with the procuring entity of the other Party.
2. Each Party shall provide  suppliers of the  other  Party with non­ discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective procedures to challenge 
alleged breaches of this Chapter arising in the context of procurements in 
which they have, or have had, an interest.
3. Each Party shall provide  its challenge procedures in writing  and 
make them generally available. 
4. Challenges shall be  heard  by a  court or by an impartial and 
independent review body with no interest in  the  outcome  of the 
procurement and the members of which are secure from external influence
during the term of appointment.
5. A Party’s total liability for any breach of this Chapter  or
compensation for loss or damages suffered shall be limited to the costs for
tender preparation reasonably incurred by the supplier for the purpose of
the procurement.
ARTICLE 9.20 : EXCEPTIONS 
1. Nothing  in this Chapter shall be  construed  to  prevent any Party 
from taking  any action or not disclosing  any  information which it 
considers necessary for the  protection of its essential security  interests
relating to the procurement of arms, ammunition or war materials, or to 
procurement indispensable  for national security or for national  defence
purposes.
2. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a 
manner  which would  constitute  a  means of arbitrary or unjustifiable 
discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or a 
disguised restriction on international trade, nothing  in this Chapter shall 
be construed to prevent any Party from imposing or enforcing measures: 
(a)  necessary to protect public morals, order or safety; 
(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; 
(c)  necessary to protect intellectual property; or
(d) relating to the products or services of handicapped persons, of philanthropic institutions or of prison labour.
ARTICLE 9.21 : NON­DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

shall not disclose  confidential information  if such disclosure  would 
prejudice legitimate commercial interests of a particular person or might 
prejudice fair competition between suppliers, without the  formal 
authorization of the person that provided the information to the Party.
2. Nothing  in this Chapter shall be  construed  as requiring  a  Party,
including  its procuring  entities, to disclose  confidential information  if
such disclosure would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary 
to the public interest.

and security in paragraph 1  do not require  treatment in addition to  or
beyond  that which is required  by the  customary international law

substantive rights.
(a)  The  obligation to  provide fair and equitable  treatment
includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil 
or administrative adjudicatory proceedings.

requires each Party to provide the level of police protection

subsidies or grants, or to  any conditions attached  to  the  receipt or
continued  receipt of such subsidies or grants, whether  or not  such 
10­6 Customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of States
that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regards to this Article, customary

of the  other  Party or investment  of an investor of the  other  Party  to

transferable  in accordance with Article  10.11  (Transfers) and  made
without delay.
3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, any measure of expropriation 
relating  to land, which shall be  as defined  in  the  existing  domestic 
legislation of the expropriating Party on the date of entry into force of this

difficulties or threat thereof, a Party may adopt or maintain restrictions on 
payments or transfers related  to  investments. It  is recognized  that

any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is an investment

control over its investment.

in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does
not decrease  the  conformity of the  measure,  as it existed 
immediately before  the  amendment, with Article  10.3 
(National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most­Favoured­Nation 
Treatment), Article  10.7 (Performance Requirements) and 
Article 10.13 (Senior Management and Board of Directors).

Nation Treatment) and Article  10.13 (Senior Management and Board of
Directors) shall not apply to subsidies or grants provided by a Party or to 
any conditions attached  to the  receipt or continued  receipt of such 
subsidies or grants, whether  or not such subsidies or grants are offered

Party, including government supported loans, guarantees and insurance.
5. Article  10.3  (National Treatment) and  Article  10.4  (Most­ Favoured­Nation Treatment) do not apply to any measure  that is an

ARTICLE 10.15 :  DENIAL OF BENEFITS 
Subject to prior notification and  consultation  according  to  the 
procedures set out in Article 17.4 (Consultations), a Party may deny the 
benefits of this Chapter  to an investor of the  other  Party that is an

non­Party, or of the  denying  Party, and  has no  substantive  business
operations in the territory of the other Party.
ARTICLE 10.16: SUBROGATION 
1. If a Party or a designated agency of a Party makes a payment to 
any of its investors under  a  guarantee, a contract  of insurance or other

transferred right or claim shall not  be  greater  than the  original right or
claim of the investor.
2. Where  a  Party or a designated  agency of a  Party has made a 
payment to an investor of that Party and has taken over rights and claims

of the  former  under  this Chapter  which  causes loss or damage  to  the 
investor or its investment.

by consultations and negotiations.
3. Where  the  dispute  cannot be  resolved  as provided  for under 
paragraph 2  within  six  (6) months from the  date  of a  request for
consultations and negotiations, then, unless the disputing investor and the 
disputing Party agree otherwise, or if the investor concerned  has already 
submitted  the  dispute  for resolution  before  the  courts or administrative 
tribunals of the  disputing  Party, or if the  dispute is already otherwise 
subject to other  binding  dispute  settlement proceedings (excluding 
proceedings for interim measures of protection referred to in paragraph 5 
below), the investor concerned may submit the dispute for settlement to:
(a)  ICSID  for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to 
Articles 28 or 36 of the ICSID Convention, if both Parties

obligation under this Chapter causing loss or damage to the 
disputing investor or its investment;

investor and, where a claim is submitted on behalf
of an enterprise,  the  name,  address, and  place of
incorporation of the enterprise; 
(ii) nominates either paragraph 3(a), 3(b) or 3(c) of this
Article as the forum for dispute settlement (and, in

any preliminary objection (including, where applicable, seeking reasonable costs and 
legal fees incurred) to the dispute settlement forum concerned on jurisdictional grounds
or on grounds that the claimant's claim is frivolous.
10­11 The request for  consultations and  negotiations and the notice of intent should  be
referred to the competent authorities of the disputing Party, as follows:
For Peru: Dirección General de Asuntos de Economía Internacional, Competencia e Inversión Privada

(v) states the  approximate  amount of loss or damage 
allegedly caused  to the  disputing  investor or its
investment.
5. Neither  Party shall prevent the  disputing  investor from seeking 
interim measures of protection, not involving the payment of damages or
resolution of the substance of the matter in dispute  before the  courts or
administrative tribunals of the  disputing Party, prior to the institution of
proceedings before  any of the  dispute  settlement  fora referred  to  in 
paragraph 3, for the preservation of its rights and interests.
6. Neither  Party shall give  diplomatic  protection, or bring  an 
international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its investors and

conciliation or arbitration under this Article, unless such other Party has
failed to abide  by and  comply with the  award rendered  in such dispute.
Diplomatic  protection, for the  purposes of this paragraph, shall  not 
include informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating 
settlement of the dispute.

expenses derived from their participation in the arbitration or conciliation

under this Chapter.

restructuring  violates Article  10.3  (National Treatment) or Article  10.4 
(Most­Favoured­Nation Treatment).
3. Subject to paragraph 2, an investor of the  other  Party may not 
submit a claim under this Chapter that a restructuring of debt issued by a 
Party breaches an obligation under this Chapter (other  than Article 10.3

two hundred  and seventy (270) days have  elapsed  from the  date  of the 
events giving rise to the claim.

the Party’s competent authorities shall, within a reasonable period of time

domestic laws and regulations, inform the  applicant of the  decision 
concerning the application. At the request of the applicant, the competent 
authorities of the  Party shall provide,  without  undue  delay, information 
concerning the status of the application. This obligation shall not apply to 
authorization requirements that are  within  the scope  of paragraph 2  of
Article 11.7 (Non­Conforming Measures).
2. With a  view  to ensuring  that measures relating  to qualification 
requirements and  procedures, technical standards  and  licensing 
requirements do not constitute  unnecessary barriers to trade in services,
each Party shall endeavour to ensure, as appropriate for individual sectors,
that such measures are: 
(a)  based  on  objective  and transparent criteria,  such as
competence and the ability to supply the service; 
(b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality 
of the service; and 
(c)  in the  case  of licensing  procedures, not  in themselves a 
restriction on the supply of the service.

(or the results of any similar negotiations undertaken in other multilateral 
fora in which both Parties participate) enter into effect, this Article shall

services suppliers, and subject to the requirements of paragraph 4, a Party 
may recognize the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or
licences or certifications granted  in  a  particular country, including  the 
other  Party and  non­Parties. Such recognition, which may be  achieved 
through harmonization or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or
arrangement with the  country concerned or may be  accorded 
autonomously.
2. Where  a  Party recognizes, autonomously or by agreement or
arrangement, the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or
licenses or certifications granted in the territory of a non­Party, nothing in 
Article  11.4  (Most­Favoured­Nation Treatment) shall be  construed  to 
require the Party to accord such recognition to the education or experience 
obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted  in  the 
territory of the other Party.
3. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type 
referred  to in  paragraph 1, whether  existing  or future,  shall afford 
adequate opportunity for the other Party, if the other Party is interested, to 
negotiate  its accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to 
negotiate  comparable  ones with it. Where  a  Party accords recognition 
autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to 
demonstrate that education, experience, licences or certifications obtained 
or requirements met in that other Party’s territory should be recognized.
4. A Party shall not accord recognition in  a  manner which would 
constitute a means of discrimination between countries in the application 
of its standards or criteria for the authorization, licensing or certification 
of services suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.
5. Annex 11A (Professional Services) applies to measures adopted or
maintained  by a  Party relating  to the  licensing  or certification of
professional service suppliers as set out in that Annex.
ARTICLE 11.10 : TRANSFERS AND PAYMENTS

delay a transfer or payment through the equitable, non­discriminatory and 
good faith application of its laws relating to: 
(a)  bankruptcy, insolvency or the  protection of the  rights of
creditors; 
(b) issuing, trading or dealing in securities, futures, options, or
derivatives; 
(c)  financial reporting  or record  keeping  of transfers when 
necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory

ARTICLE 11.11  :  RESTRICTIONS  TO  SAFEGUARD  THE BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS 
1. In the event of serious balance of payments and external financial 
difficulties or threat thereof, a Party may adopt or maintain restrictions on 
cross­border  trade in services, including  payments or transfers for
transactions of cross­border  trade in services. It is recognized  that 
particular pressures on the balance of payments of a Party in the process
of economic  development may necessitate  the  use  of restrictions to 
ensure, inter alia, the  maintenance of a  level  of financial reserves
adequate  for the  implementation of its programme  of economic 
development.
2. The restrictions referred to in paragraph 1 shall: 
(a)  be  consistent with the  Articles of Agreement of the 
International Monetary Fund; 
(b) avoid  unnecessary damage to the  commercial, economic 
and financial interests of the other Party; 
(c)  not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances
described in paragraph 1; 
(d) be temporary and  be phased  out progressively as the 
situation specified in paragraph 1 improves; 
(e)  be applied on a national treatment basis and such that the 
other  Party is treated  no less favourably than any non­ Party.
3. Any restrictions adopted or maintained under paragraph 1, or any 
changes therein, shall be promptly notified to the other Party.
4. The  Party adopting  any restrictions under  paragraph 1  shall 
commence  consultations with the  other  Party in order  to review  the 
restrictions adopted by it.

benefits of this Chapter to: 
(a)  a service supplier of the other Party if the service supplier
is an enterprise owned or controlled  by persons of a non­ Party and  such enterprise  has no  substantive  business
operations in the territory of the other Party; or

is an enterprise  owned  or controlled  by persons of the 
denying  Party and  such enterprise  has no substantive 
business operations in the territory of the other Party.
ARTICLE 11.13 : TRANSPARENCY 
1. Each Party shall publish promptly or otherwise  make publicly

be published. 
2. Each Party shall maintain or establish appropriate  mechanisms
for responding  to inquiries from interested  persons regarding its
regulations relating to the subject matter of this Chapter 11­9
.
ARTICLE 11.14 : IMPLEMENTATION

convenes under  Article 16.1  (The  Free Trade Commission) of this
Agreement, or as otherwise agreed, to review the implementation of this

services. Among other  issues, the  Parties may  consult with a view to 
determining  the  feasibility of removing  any remaining  citizenship  or
permanent residency requirements for the  supply of services in  the 
territory of each Party. Such consultations may also include consideration 
of the  development of procedures that  could contribute  to  greater 
transparency of measures described in paragraph 1(c) and paragraph 2 of
Article 11.7 (Non­Conforming Measures).
11­9 The Parties’ implementation of their obligations to establish appropriate mechanisms
for small administrative agencies may need  to take into account resource and  budget
constraints.

Chapter  or a  particular  case  arising  under  paragraph 2  of
Article 12.2 (General Obligations) unless:

information or technical advice.
ARTICLE 17.12 : INITIAL REPORT 
1. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the Panel shall base its report

Panel shall lapse unless the Parties agree otherwise. If the authority of the 
Panel has lapsed  and  the  Parties have  not reached  an agreement on the 
settlement of the dispute, nothing in this provision shall prevent a Party 
from instituting new proceedings relating to the same matter.
2. The Parties may agree to terminate the proceedings before a Panel 
at any time by jointly notifying the chairperson of the Panel to this effect.
ARTICLE 17.16 : IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPORT

3. Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Parties from, at any time,
agreeing to resolve the dispute in a manner that departs from any findings, determinations or recommendations of the panel.
ARTICLE 17.17 : NON­IMPLEMENTATION–SUSPENSION OF BENEFITS 
1. If a  Panel  has made a determination  of the  type  described in 
Article 17.13 (Final Report) and the Parties are unable to reach agreement 
on a resolution pursuant to Article 17.16 (Implementation of the Report)
within thirty (30) days of receiving the final report, or such other period 
as the  disputing  Parties agree,  the  Party complained  against shall enter 
into negotiations with the complaining Party with a  view to developing 
mutually acceptable compensation. This compensation shall be paid from 
the  moment the  Parties agree  to  it until the  Party complained  against 
complies, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.
2. If the disputing Parties:
(a)  are  unable  to agree  on compensation within  thirty (30)
days after the period for developing such compensation has
begun, or
(b) have  agreed on compensation or on a resolution pursuant 
to Article  17.16  (Implementation of the Report), and  the 
complaining Party considers that the other Party has failed 
to observe the terms of the agreement,
the complaining Party may at any time thereafter provide written notice to 
the Party complained against that it intends to suspend the application, to 
that Party, of benefits of equivalent effect. The  notice shall specify the 
level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend 17­2
. The complaining 
Party may begin suspending  benefits thirty (30) days after  the  date  on 
which it provides written notice under this paragraph, or seven (7) days
after the Panel issues its determination under paragraph 3, as the case may 
be. 
3. If the Party complained against considers that: 
(a)  the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly 
excessive; or,
(b) it has eliminated  the  non­conformity that the  Panel  has
found,
it may, within thirty (30) days after the complaining Party provides notice
under  paragraph 2, request that the  original  Panel  be  reconvened  to 
consider the matter. The Party complained against shall deliver its request 
in writing to the complaining Party. The Panel shall reconvene as soon as
possible after delivery of the request and shall present its determination to 
the disputing Parties within sixty (60) days after it reconvenes. Where the 
original Panel cannot hear the matter for any reason, a new Panel shall be 
appointed  pursuant to the  procedures set out in  Article  17.9  (Panel 
Selection). If the Panel determines that the level of benefits proposed to 
be  suspended  is manifestly excessive,  it shall determine  the level of
benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect.
4. The  complaining  Party may suspend  benefits up to the  level the 
Panel  has determined  under  paragraph 3  or, if the  Panel  has not 
determined  the  level, the  level the  complaining Party has proposed  to 
suspend under paragraph 2, unless the Panel has determined that the Party 
complained against has eliminated the non­conformity.
17­2 For greater certainty, the phrase the level of benefits that the Party proposes to 
suspend refers to the level of concessions under the Agreement the suspension of which 
a complaining  Party considers will have an effect equivalent to that of the disputed 
measure, and shall be restricted to benefits granted to the Party complained against under 
this Agreement.
5. If the  Panel  decides that the  Party complained  against has
eliminated  the  non­conformity, the complaining Party shall promptly 
reinstate any benefits such Party has suspended under paragraph 3.
6. In considering what benefits to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2: 
(a)  a complaining Party should first seek to suspend benefits in 
the same sector or sectors as that affected by the measure 
or other matter that the Panel has found to be inconsistent 
with the obligations of this Agreement; and 
(b) a  complaining Party that considers it is not practicable  or
effective to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors
may suspend benefits in other sectors.
7. The suspension of benefits shall be  temporary and shall only be 
applied until such time as: 
(a)  the Party eliminates the non­conformity that the Panel has
found; or
(b) a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.
ARTICLE 17.18 : COMPLIANCE REVIEW 
1. In those cases where suspension of benefits have been applied, and 
the Party complained against considers that: 
(a)  has eliminated  the  non­conformity  that the  Panel has
found; or
(b) has complied  with any mutually satisfactory solution 
reached; or
(c)  the level of benefits suspended is manifestly excessive 
it may refer  the  matter to the  Panel  by providing  written notice to the 
complaining Party. The Panel shall issue its report on the matter within 
thirty (30) days, and  within  fifteen (15) days in the  case  of perishable 
goods, after the Party complained against provides notice. 
2. If the  Panel  decides that the  Party complained  against has
eliminated  the  non­conformity, the complaining Party shall promptly 
reinstate  any  benefits suspended  under  Article  17.17  (NonImplementation—Suspension of Benefits).
3. If the Panel determines that the level of benefits suspended by the 
complaining Party is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of
benefits that  it  considers to be  of equivalent effect, with  which the 
complaining Party shall comply.
ARTICLE 17.19 : FIVE­YEAR REVIEW 
The Commission shall review the  operation and effectiveness of
Articles 17.16  (Implementation of the  Report) and  17.17  (NonImplementation—Suspension of Benefits) every  five  (5) years, unless
otherwise agreed by the Parties.

1. For purposes of Chapters 2 through 7, Article XX  of the GATT
1994  and  its interpretative  notes are  incorporated  into and made part of
this Agreement, mutatis  mutandis. The  Parties understand  that the 
measures referred  to in Article  XX(b) of the  GATT 1994  include 
environmental measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life 
or health, and that Article XX(g) of the GATT 1994 applies to measures
relating  to the  conservation of living  and  non­living  exhaustible  natural 
resources.
2. For purposes of Chapter  10  (Investment), Chapter  11  (Cross­ Border Trade in Services), Chapter  12  (Temporary Entry for Business

referred  to in Article  XIV(b) of the GATS  include  environmental 
measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health.
ARTICLE 18.2 : ESSENTIAL SECURITY 
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed: 
(a)  to require  a  Party to furnish or allow  access to any 
information the disclosure of which it determines to be 
contrary to its essential security interests; or
(b) to preclude a  Party from applying  measures that it 
considers necessary for the  fulfillment of its obligations
with respect to the  maintenance  or restoration of
international peace or security, or the protection of its own 
essential security interests.
ARTICLE 18.3 : TAXATION 
1. Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall 
apply to taxation measures.

between the Parties, the competent authorities under that convention shall 
have sole responsibility for determining whether any inconsistency exists
between this Agreement and that convention.

. An  investor that seeks to invoke Article  10.10 
(Expropriation and  Nationalisation) with respect to a  taxation measure 
must first refer to the competent authorities described in paragraph 4, at 
the time that it gives notice under  Article  10.17 (Investor­State Dispute 
Settlement), the  issue  of whether  that taxation  measure  involves an 
expropriation. If the  competent authorities do not  agree  to consider  the 
issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not 
an expropriation within  a  period  of six (6) months of such referral, the 
investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 10.17 (Investor­ State Dispute Settlement).
4. For the purposes of this Article, competent authorities means: 
(a)  for Singapore,  Chief Tax Policy Officer, Ministry of
Finance, or his successor or such other  public officer  as
may be designated by Singapore; and 
(b) for Peru, Ministerio de  Economía  y Finanzas, or his
successor or such other public officer as may be designated 
by Peru.
ARTICLE 18.4 : DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

(b)  taxation measures which are consistent with internationally recognised tax

(c)  taxation measures which are applied  on a non­discriminatory basis, as
opposed to being targeted at investors of a particular nationality or specific
individual taxpayers, are less likely to constitute expropriation. A taxation 
measure should  not constitute expropriation if, when the investment is
made, it was already in force, and information about the measure was made
public or otherwise made publicly available.
