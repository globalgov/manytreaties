For the purpose of monitoring the functioning of this Agreement and for the period of 10 years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall annually exchange import statistics for the period covering the most recent calendar year available. The period may be extended by the Committee on Trade in Goods established pursuant to Article 22.3 for another five years.

2.   The exchange of import statistics referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover, to the extent possible, data pertaining to the period covering the most recent calendar year available, including value and volume, based on the nomenclature of the Party, of imports of goods of the other Party benefitting from preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement and those that do not receive preferential tariff treatment.

ARTICLE 2.33

Special measures concerning the management of preferential tariff treatment

1.   The Parties recognise that breaches of their customs legislation relating to the preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement could adversely affect the domestic industry and agree to cooperate on preventing, detecting and combating such breaches in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 3 and the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Japan on Co-operation and Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters, done at Brussels on 30 January 2008 (hereinafter referred to as ‘CMAA’).

2.   A Party may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraphs 4 to 7, temporarily suspend the preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement for the goods concerned which are related to the systematic breaches referred to in subparagraph (a), if the Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective, compelling and verifiable information, that:

(a)

systematic breaches in its customs legislation related to the preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement for a certain good have been committed; and

(b)

the other Party has systematically and unjustifiably refused or has otherwise failed to conduct the cooperation referred to in paragraph 1 in relation to the systematic breaches referred to in subparagraph (a).

3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the temporary suspension shall not be applied to traders who fulfil the compliance criteria agreed by the Parties through the consultations referred to in paragraph 4.

4.   The Party which has made the finding referred to in paragraph 2 shall, without undue delay, notify the other Party of that finding with sufficient information to justify the initiation of consultations, including a summary of essential facts related to subparagraphs 2(a) and (b), and enter into consultations with the other Party in the Committee on Trade in Goods with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties and agreeing on the compliance criteria with regard to the requirements of this Agreement and the relevant customs legislation.

5.   The Party which has made the finding referred to in paragraph 2 shall, before a final decision is made, inform all interested parties of its intention to apply a temporary suspension, and shall ensure that they have a full opportunity for defending their interests. A temporary suspension shall not be applied to interested parties, provided that they objectively and satisfactorily demonstrate to the Party which has made the finding that they are not involved in the systematic breaches referred to in subparagraph 2(a).

6.   Following the processes referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, if the Parties have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within six months of the notification, the Party which has made the finding may decide to suspend temporarily the preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement for the goods concerned, duly taking into account the exception provided for in paragraph 3. A temporary suspension shall be notified to the other Party without undue delay.

7.   A temporary suspension shall be applied only for the period necessary to counteract the breaches and no longer than six months. If a Party has made a finding that the conditions that gave rise to the initial suspension persist at the expiry of the temporary suspension, that Party may decide to renew the temporary suspension, after notifying the other Party of such a finding with sufficient information to justify the renewal. Any temporary suspension shall be terminated on a date no later than two years from the initial suspension unless it has been demonstrated to the Committee on Trade in Goods that the conditions that gave rise to the initial suspension still persist at the expiry of the period of each renewal.

8.   The applied temporary suspensions shall be subject to periodic consultations in the Committee on Trade in Goods.

9.   The Party which has made the finding referred to in paragraph 2 or 7 shall publish, in accordance with its internal procedures, notices to importers about any notification and decision concerning temporary suspensions referred to in paragraphs 4 to 7.

A temporary suspension shall not apply to traders other than the traders referred to in paragraph 3 and the interested parties referred to in paragraph 5, provided that they objectively and satisfactorily demonstrate to the Party which has made the finding referred to in paragraph 2 or 7 that they are not involved in the systematic breaches referred to in subparagraph 2(a).

(b)

‘serious injury’ means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry;

(c)

‘threat of serious injury’ means serious injury that is clearly imminent in accordance with the investigation referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 5.4. A determination of the existence of a threat of serious injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility; and

(d)

SECTION B

Bilateral safeguard measures

ARTICLE 5.2

Application of bilateral safeguard measures

1.   If, as a result of the elimination or reduction of a customs duty in accordance with Article 2.8, an originating good from one Party is being imported into the other Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to a domestic industry, the other Party may adopt the measures provided for in paragraph 2 to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry of the other Party and to facilitate the adjustment of the domestic industry.

2.   Bilateral safeguard measure may consist of:

(a)

the suspension of any further reduction of the rate of customs duty on the originating good provided for in Chapter 2; or

(b)

the increase of the rate of customs duty on the originating good to a level not exceeding the lesser of:

(i)

most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect on the day when the bilateral safeguard measure is applied; and

(ii)

most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 5.3

Conditions and limitations

1.   No bilateral safeguard measure shall be maintained except to the extent and for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate the adjustment of the domestic industry, provided that such period of time does not exceed a period of two years. However, a bilateral safeguard measure may be extended, provided that the total duration of the bilateral safeguard measure, including such extensions, does not exceed four years.

2.   Bilateral safeguard measures may only be applied during the transition period.

3.   In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the expected duration of a bilateral safeguard measure exceeds one year, the Party maintaining the bilateral safeguard measure shall progressively liberalise the bilateral safeguard measure at regular intervals during the period of application.

4.   No bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied to the import of a particular originating good which has already been subject to such a bilateral safeguard measure for a period of time equal to the duration of the previous bilateral safeguard measure or one year, whichever is longer.

5.   Upon the termination of a bilateral safeguard measure, the rate of customs duty for the originating good subject to the measure shall be the rate which would have been in effect but for the bilateral safeguard measure.

ARTICLE 5.4

Investigation

1.   A Party may apply a bilateral safeguard measure only after an investigation has been carried out by its competent authority (18) in accordance with the same procedures as those provided for in Article 3 and subparagraph 2(c) of Article 4 of the Agreement on Safeguards.

2.   The investigation shall in all cases be completed within one year following its date of initiation.

3.   In the investigation to determine whether the increased imports of an originating good have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry, the competent authority which carries out the investigation shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of that domestic industry. Those factors include, in particular, the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the originating good in absolute and relative terms, the share of the domestic market taken by the increased imports of the originating good, and the changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment.

4.   The determination that increased imports of an originating good have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry shall not be made unless the investigation demonstrates, on the basis of objective evidence, the existence of a causal link between the increased imports of the originating good and the serious injury or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry. In this determination, factors other than the increased imports of the originating good which are also causing injury to the domestic industry at the same time shall be taken into consideration.

ARTICLE 5.5

Notification

1.   A Party shall immediately notify the other Party in writing when it:

(a)

initiates an investigation referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 5.4 relating to serious injury, or threat of serious injury, and the reasons for it;

(b)

makes a finding of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, caused by increased imports; and

(c)

takes a decision to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure.

2.   The notifying Party referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide the other Party with all pertinent information, which shall include:

(a)

in the case of a notification referred to in subparagraph 1(a), the reason for the initiation of the investigation, a precise description of the originating good subject to the investigation and its subheading under the Harmonized System, the expected duration of the investigation and the date of initiation of the investigation; and

ARTICLE 5.6

Consultations and compensations

1.   A Party proposing to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure shall provide adequate opportunity for prior consultations with the other Party with a view to reviewing the information arising from the investigation referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 5.4, exchanging views on the bilateral safeguard measure and reaching an agreement on compensation as provided for in this Article.

2.   A Party proposing to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure shall provide the other Party with mutually agreed adequate means of trade compensation in the form of concessions of customs duties, the value of which is substantially equivalent to that of the additional customs duties expected to result from the bilateral safeguard measure.

3.   If the Parties are unable to agree on the compensation within 30 days after the commencement of the consultations, the Party to whose originating good the bilateral safeguard measure is applied shall be free to suspend the application of concessions of customs duties under this Agreement, the value of which is substantially equivalent to that of the additional customs duties resulting from the bilateral safeguard measure. The Party exercising the right of suspension may suspend the application of concessions of customs duties only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects and only while the bilateral safeguard measure is maintained.

4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, the right of suspension referred to in that paragraph shall not be exercised for the first 24 months during which a bilateral safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the bilateral safeguard measure has been taken as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that such a safeguard measure conforms to the provisions of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 5.7

Provisional bilateral safeguard measures

1.   In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a Party may apply a provisional bilateral safeguard measure, which shall take the form of a measure set out in subparagraph 2(a) or (b) of Article 5.2, pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports of an originating good of the other Party have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry of the Party proposing to apply the provisional bilateral safeguard measure.

2.   A Party shall notify the other Party in writing of its proposed provisional bilateral safeguard measure no later than at the date of application thereof. Consultations between the Parties on the application of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be initiated immediately after the provisional bilateral safeguard measure is applied. The notification shall contain evidence of the existence of critical circumstances, evidence of serious injury or threat of serious injury caused by the increased imports of the originating good, a precise description of the originating good subject to the proposed provisional bilateral safeguard measure and its subheading under the Harmonized System, and a precise description of the proposed provisional bilateral safeguard measure.

3.   The duration of a provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall not exceed 200 days. During that period, the pertinent requirements of Article 5.4 shall be met. The duration of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be counted as part of the period referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 5.3.

4.   Paragraph 5 of Article 5.3 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to a provisional bilateral safeguard measure. The customs duty imposed as a result of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be refunded if the subsequent investigation referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 5.4 does not determine that the increased imports of the originating good subject to the provisional bilateral safeguard measure have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to a domestic industry.

In cases where scientific evidence is insufficient, the importing Party may provisionally adopt emergency measures on the basis of available pertinent information, including that from the relevant international organisation. The importing Party shall review the emergency measure with a view to minimising its negative effect on trade by either repealing that measure or replacing it by a permanent measure.

ARTICLE 6.14

Equivalence

1.   The importing Party shall accept sanitary and phytosanitary measures of the exporting Party as equivalent if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that its measures achieve the importing Party's appropriate level of protection. For that purpose, reasonable access shall be given, upon request, to the importing Party for inspection, testing and other relevant procedures.

2.   The Parties shall, on request of either Party, enter into consultations with the aim of achieving arrangements determining the equivalence of specified sanitary and phytosanitary measures.

3.   In determining the equivalence of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, the Parties shall take into account the relevant guidance of the WTO Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, in particular its Decision on the Implementation of Article 4 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (21) and international standards, guidelines and recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius, OIE or IPPC.

4.   Where equivalence has been determined, the Parties may agree on alternative import conditions and simplified certificates, taking into account international standards, guidelines or recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius, OIE or IPPC.

CHAPTER 7

TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE

ARTICLE 7.1

Objectives

The objectives of this Chapter are to facilitate and to increase trade in goods between the Parties by:

(a)

ensuring that technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade;

(b)

enhancing joint cooperation between the Parties, including on the implementation of the TBT Agreement; and

(c)

pursuing appropriate ways to reduce unnecessary negative effects on trade by measures within the scope of this Chapter.

ARTICLE 7.2

Scope

1.   This Chapter applies to the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures of central government bodies, as defined in the TBT Agreement, that may affect trade in goods between the Parties.

2.   Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to encourage the observance of the provisions of Articles 7.5 to 7.11 by local government bodies within its territory on the level directly below that of the central government, which are responsible for the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures.

3.   This Chapter does not apply to:

(a)

purchasing specifications prepared by a governmental body for its production or consumption requirements; or

(b)

sanitary and phytosanitary measures as defined in Annex A to the SPS Agreement.

ARTICLE 7.3

Incorporation of certain provisions of the TBT Agreement

1.   The Parties affirm their rights and obligations under the TBT Agreement.

2.   Articles 2 to 9 of the TBT Agreement and Annexes 1 and 3 to the TBT Agreement are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis.

3.   Where a dispute arises regarding a particular measure of a Party which the other Party alleges to be exclusively in breach of the provisions of the TBT Agreement referred to in paragraph 2, that other Party shall, notwithstanding paragraph 1 of Article 21.27, select the dispute settlement mechanism under the WTO Agreement.

ARTICLE 7.4

Definitions

For the purposes of this Chapter, the terms and definitions set out in Annex 1 to the TBT Agreement apply.

ARTICLE 7.5

Technical regulations

1.   The Parties recognise the importance of good regulatory practices with regard to the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, in particular of the work carried out by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade on good regulatory practices. In this context, each Party undertakes to:

(a)

when developing a technical regulation:

(i)

assess, in accordance with its laws and regulations or administrative guidelines, the available regulatory or non-regulatory alternatives to the proposed technical regulation that may fulfil its legitimate objective, in order to ensure that the proposed technical regulation is not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil its legitimate objective, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the TBT Agreement; nothing in this provision shall affect the rights of each Party to prepare, adopt and apply measures without delay where urgent problems including safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise;

(ii)

endeavour to systematically carry out impact assessments for technical regulations with significant effect on trade, including an assessment of their impact on trade; and

(iii)

specify, wherever appropriate, technical regulations based on product requirements in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and

(b)

review, without prejudice to paragraph 3 of Article 2 of the TBT Agreement, adopted technical regulations at appropriate intervals, preferably not exceeding five years, in particular with a view to increasing their convergence with relevant international standards. In undertaking this review, each Party shall, inter alia, take into account any new development in the relevant international standards and whether the circumstances giving rise to divergences of that Party's technical regulations from any relevant international standard continue to exist. The outcome of this review shall be communicated and explained to the other Party on its request.

2.   When a Party considers that its technical regulation and a technical regulation of the other Party that have the same objectives and product coverage are equivalent, that Party may request in writing, providing detailed reasons, that the other Party recognise those technical regulations as equivalent. The requested Party shall give positive consideration to accepting those technical regulations as equivalent, even if they differ, provided that it is satisfied that the technical regulation of the requesting Party adequately fulfils the objectives of its own technical regulation. If the requested Party does not accept a technical regulation of the requesting Party as equivalent, the requested Party shall, on request of the requesting Party, explain the reasons for its decision.

3.   On request of a Party that has an interest in developing a technical regulation similar to a technical regulation of the other Party, the requested Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the requesting Party with relevant information, including studies or documents, except for confidential information, on which it has relied in developing its technical regulation.

4.   Each Party shall uniformly and consistently apply requirements relating to the placement of products on the market which are established in technical regulations applicable to its whole territory. If a Party has substantiated reasons to believe that any of these requirements are not applied uniformly and consistently in the territory of the other Party, and that this situation leads to significant impact on bilateral trade, that Party may notify the other Party of those substantiated reasons with a view to clarifying the issue, and, if appropriate, addressing it in a timely manner by the contact point referred to in Article 7.14 or by other appropriate bodies established under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 7.6

International standards

1.   For the purposes of applying this Chapter and the TBT Agreement, standards issued by international organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the United Nations Sub-Committee of Experts on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UNSCEGHS), and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) shall be considered as relevant international standards as referred to in this Chapter, Articles 2 and 5 of the TBT Agreement and Annex 3 to the TBT Agreement, provided that in their development, the principles and procedures set out in the Decision of the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with Relation to Articles 2 and 5 of the TBT Agreement and Annex 3 to the TBT Agreement (22) have been followed, except when such standards or relevant parts of them would be ineffective or inappropriate for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued.

2.   With a view to harmonising standards on as wide a basis as possible, the Parties shall encourage regional or national standardising bodies within their territories to:

(a)

play a full part, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation by relevant international standardising bodies of international standards;

(b)

use relevant international standards as a basis for the standards they develop, except where such international standards would be ineffective or inappropriate, for instance because of an insufficient level of protection or fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems;

(c)

avoid duplication of, or overlap with, the work of international standardising bodies; and

(d)

review their standards which are not based on relevant international standards at appropriate intervals, preferably not exceeding five years, with a view to increasing their convergence with relevant international standards.

3.   When developing technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures:

(a)

each Party shall use relevant international standards, guides or recommendations, or the relevant parts of them, to the extent provided for in paragraph 4 of Article 2 and in paragraph 4 of Article 5 of the TBT Agreement, as a basis for its technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and avoid deviations from the relevant international standards or additional requirements when compared to those standards, except when the Party developing the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure can demonstrate, based on relevant information, including available scientific or technical evidence, that such international standards would be ineffective or inappropriate for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued, as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 2 and paragraph 4 of Article 5 of the TBT Agreement; and

(b)

if a Party does not use relevant international standards, guides or recommendations, or the relevant parts of them, as referred to in paragraph 1, as a basis for its technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures, that Party shall, on request of the other Party, explain the reasons why it considers such international standards to be ineffective or inappropriate for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued, as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 2 and paragraph 4 of Article 5 of the TBT Agreement, and provide the relevant information, including available scientific or technical evidence on which this assessment is based, as well as identify the parts of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure concerned which in substance deviate from the relevant international standards, guides or recommendations.

4.   Each Party shall encourage its regional or national standardising bodies within its territory to cooperate with the relevant standardising bodies of the other Party in international standardising activities. Such cooperation may take place in international standardising bodies of which both Parties or standardising bodies of both Parties are members. Such bilateral cooperation could aim, inter alia, at promoting the development of international standards, facilitating the development of common standards for both Parties in areas of shared interest where there are no international standards, in particular as regards new products or technologies, or further enhancing the exchange of information between the standardising bodies of the Parties.

ARTICLE 7.7

Standards

1.   The Parties affirm their obligations under paragraph 1 of Article 4 of the TBT Agreement to ensure that regional or national standardising bodies within their territories accept and comply with the Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards in Annex 3 to the TBT Agreement.

2.   The Parties recall that, pursuant to the definition of a standard in Annex 1 to the TBT Agreement, compliance with standards is not mandatory. Where compliance with a standard is required in a Party through incorporation of, or reference to, that standard in a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, the Party shall, in developing the draft technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, comply with the transparency obligations set out in paragraph 9 of Article 2 or paragraph 6 of Article 5 of the TBT Agreement, and in Article 7.9.

3.   Each Party shall encourage, subject to its laws and regulations, its regional or national standardising bodies to ensure adequate participation of interested persons within the territory of that Party in the standard development process and to allow persons of the other Party to participate in consultation procedures, which are available to the general public, on terms no less favourable than those accorded to its own persons.

4.   The Parties undertake to exchange information on:

(a)

each Party's use of standards in support of demonstrating or facilitating compliance with technical regulations;

(b)

their standard setting processes, in particular the manner and extent to which international or regional standards are used as a basis for their regional or national standards; and

(c)

cooperation agreements or arrangements on standardisation with third parties or international organisations.

ARTICLE 7.8

Conformity assessment procedures

1.   With respect to the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, subparagraphs 1(a)(i), 1(a)(ii) and 1(b) of Article 7.5 also apply, mutatis mutandis, to conformity assessment procedures.

2.   In conformity with paragraph 1.2 of Article 5 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall ensure that conformity assessment procedures are not stricter or are not applied more strictly than is necessary to give the importing Party adequate confidence that products conform with the applicable technical regulations or standards, taking into account the risks associated with products, including the risks that non-conformity would create.

3.   The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures. Such mechanisms may include:

(a)

mutual recognition agreements for the results of conformity assessment procedures with respect to specific technical regulations conducted by bodies located in the territory of the other Party;

(b)

cooperative and voluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies located in the territories of the Parties;

(c)

plurilateral and multilateral recognition agreements or arrangements to which both Parties are participants;

(d)

the use of accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies;

(e)

government designation of conformity assessment bodies, including conformity assessment bodies located in the other Party;

(f)

recognition by a Party of results of conformity assessment procedures conducted in the territory of the other Party; and

(g)

manufacturer's or supplier's declaration of conformity.

4.   The Parties shall exchange information regarding the mechanisms covered by paragraph 3. A Party shall, on request of the other Party, provide information on:

(a)

the mechanisms referred to in paragraph 3 and similar mechanisms with a view to facilitating the acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures;

(b)

factors, including assessment and management of risk, considered when selecting appropriate conformity assessment procedures for specific products; and

(c)

accreditation policy, including on international standards for accreditation, and international agreements and arrangements in the field of accreditation, including those of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), to the extent possible and used by a Party in a specific area.

5.   With regard to those mechanisms each Party shall:

(a)

use, whenever possible and in accordance with its laws and regulations, a supplier's declaration of conformity as assurance of conformity with the applicable technical regulations;

(b)

use accreditation with authority derived from government or performed by government, as appropriate, as a means to demonstrate technical competence to qualify conformity assessment bodies;

(c)

if accreditation is established by law as a necessary separate step to qualify conformity assessment bodies, ensure that accreditation activities are independent from conformity assessment activities and that there are no conflicts of interest between accreditation bodies and the conformity assessment bodies they accredit; the Parties may comply with this obligation by means of the separation of conformity assessment bodies from accreditation bodies; (23)

(d)

consider joining or, as applicable, not prohibit testing, inspection and certification bodies from joining, international agreements or arrangements for the facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results; and

(e)

if two or more conformity assessment bodies are authorised by a Party to carry out conformity assessment procedures required for placing a product on the market, not prohibit economic operators from choosing among conformity assessment bodies.

6.   The Parties shall cooperate in the field of mutual recognition in accordance with the Agreement on Mutual Recognition between the European Community and Japan, done at Brussels on 4 April 2001. The Parties may also decide, in accordance with relevant provisions of that Agreement, to extend the coverage as regards to the products, the applicable regulatory requirements and the recognised conformity assessment bodies.

ARTICLE 7.9

Transparency

1.   When developing a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure which may have a significant effect on trade, each Party shall:

(a)

carry out consultation procedures, subject to its laws and regulations, which are available to the general public and make the results of such consultation procedures and any existing impact assessments publicly available;

(b)

allow persons of the other Party to participate in consultation procedures which are available to the general public on terms no less favourable than those accorded to its own persons;

(c)

take into account the other Party's views when carrying out consultation procedures which are available to the general public and, on request of the other Party, provide written responses in a timely manner to the comments made by that Party;

(d)

in addition to subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 7.5, make publicly available the results of the impact assessment on a proposed technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, if carried out, including of the impact on trade; and

(e)

endeavour to provide, on request of the other Party, a summary in English of the impact assessment referred to in subparagraph (d).

2.   Each Party shall, when making notifications in accordance with paragraph 9.2 of Article 2 or paragraph 6.2 of Article 5 of the TBT Agreement:

(a)

allow in principle at least 60 days from the date of notification for the other Party to provide written comments to the proposal, except where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise and, where practicable, give appropriate consideration to reasonable requests for extending the comment period;

(b)

provide the electronic version of the full notified text together with the notification;

(c)

provide, in case the notified text is not in one of the official WTO languages, a detailed and comprehensive description of the content of the measure in the notification format, as well as, if already available, a translation of the notified text in one of the official WTO languages;

(d)

reply in writing to written comments received from the other Party on the proposal, no later than the date of publication of the final technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure;

(e)

provide information on the adopted final text through an addendum to the original notification;

(f)

allow a reasonable interval (24) between the publication of technical regulations and their entry into force for economic operators of the other Party to adapt; and

(g)

ensure that the enquiry points established in accordance with Article 10 of the TBT Agreement provide information and answers in one of the official WTO languages to reasonable enquiries from the other Party or from interested persons of the other Party on adopted technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures.

3.   Each Party shall, on request of the other Party, provide information regarding the objectives of, and rationale for, a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that the Party has adopted or is proposing to adopt.

4.   Each Party shall ensure that all adopted technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures are publicly and freely available on official websites and, if already available, in English.

ARTICLE 7.10

Market surveillance

1.   For the purposes of this Article, ‘market surveillance’ is a public authority function separate from and carried out after conformity assessment procedures, and means activities conducted and measures taken by public authorities on the basis of procedures of a Party to enable that Party to monitor or address compliance of products with the requirements set out in its laws and regulations.

2.   Each Party shall, inter alia:

(a)

exchange information with the other Party on market surveillance and enforcement activities, for example on the authorities responsible for market surveillance and enforcement, or on measures taken against dangerous products;

(b)

ensure the independence of market surveillance functions from conformity assessment functions with a view to avoiding conflicts of interest; (25) and

(c)

ensure that there are no conflicts of interest between market surveillance authorities and the persons concerned, subject to control or supervision, including the manufacturer, the importer and the distributor.

ARTICLE 7.11

Marking and labelling

1.   The Parties note that a technical regulation may include or deal exclusively with marking or labelling requirements. Accordingly, if a Party develops marking or labelling requirements in the form of a technical regulation, that Party shall ensure that such requirements are not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade and are not more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil legitimate objectives as referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the TBT Agreement.

2.   In particular, the Parties agree that, if a Party requires marking or labelling of product in the form of a technical regulation:

(a)

information required for such marking or labelling of products shall be limited to what is relevant for persons concerned, including consumers, users of the product or authorities, for indicating the product's compliance with regulatory requirements;

(b)

a Party shall not require any prior approval, registration or certification of markings or the labels of products as a precondition for placing on its market products that otherwise comply with its mandatory technical requirements, unless necessary to fulfil its legitimate objective;

(c)

if that Party requires the use of a unique identification number for marking or labelling of products, it shall issue such number to the persons concerned, including the manufacturer, the importer and the distributor, without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis;

(d)

provided that it is not misleading, contradictory or confusing, or that the Party's legitimate objectives are not compromised, the Party shall permit the following in relation to the information required in the country of destination of the goods:

(i)

information in other languages in addition to the language required in the country of destination of the goods;

(ii)

international nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or graphics; and

(iii)

information in addition to that required in the country of destination of the goods;

(e)

the Party shall accept that labelling and corrections to labelling take place in customs warehouses at the point of import as an alternative to labelling in the exporting Party unless such labelling is required to be carried out by approved persons for reasons of public health or safety; and

(f)

the Party shall, unless it considers that legitimate objectives under the TBT Agreement are compromised thereby, endeavour to accept non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than physically attached to the product.

ARTICLE 7.12

Cooperation

1.   The Parties shall strengthen their cooperation in the field of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures with a view to increasing the mutual understanding of their respective systems and facilitating access to their respective markets. The Parties recognise that existing regulatory cooperation dialogues are important means to strengthen such cooperation.

2.   The Parties shall seek to identify, develop and promote trade facilitating initiatives of mutual interest.

3.   The initiatives referred to in paragraph 2 may include:

(a)

improving the quality and effectiveness of their respective technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures, and promoting good regulatory practices through regulatory cooperation between the Parties, including the exchange of information, experience and data;

2.   Within the framework of its postal legislation or by other customary means, each Party shall set out the scope of the universal service obligation, fully taking into account the needs of the users and national conditions, including market forces, of that Party.

3.   Each Party shall ensure that a supplier of postal and courier services in its territory which is subject to a universal service obligation under its laws and regulations does not engage in the following practices:

(a)

excluding the business activities of other enterprises by cross-subsidising, with revenues derived from the supply of the universal service, the supply of express mail services (EMS) (48) or any non-universal service in a way which constitutes a private monopolisation in contravention of Article 3 of the Law Concerning Prohibition of Private Monopoly and Maintenance of Fair Trade (Law No. 54 of 1947) of Japan or an abuse of a dominant market position in contravention of the competition law of the European Union respectively; (49) or

(b)

unjustifiably differentiating among customers, such as large volume mailers or consolidators, where like conditions prevail with respect to charges and the provisions concerning acceptance, delivery, redirection, return and the number of days required for delivery for the supply of a service subject to a universal service obligation.

2.   If a Party requires a licence, it shall make publicly available:

(a)

all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and

(b)

the terms and conditions of licences.

3.   If a licence application is rejected by the competent authority, it shall upon request inform the applicant of the reasons for the rejection of the licence. Each Party shall establish an appeal procedure through an independent body available to applicants whose licence has been rejected. That procedure shall be transparent, non-discriminatory, and based on objective criteria.

ARTICLE 8.40

Independence of the regulatory body

Each Party shall ensure that:

4.   Nothing in this Sub-Section shall be construed as requiring a Party:

(a)

to authorise a service supplier of the other Party to establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate or supply telecommunications transport networks or services other than as provided for in this Agreement; or

(b)

to establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate or supply telecommunications transport networks or services not offered to the public generally, or to oblige a service supplier under its jurisdiction to do so.

ARTICLE 8.42

Approaches to regulation

1.   The Parties recognise the value of competitive markets to deliver a wide choice in the supply of telecommunications services and to enhance consumer welfare, and that economic regulation may not be needed if there is effective competition. Accordingly, the Parties recognise that regulatory needs and approaches differ market by market, and that a Party may determine how to implement its obligations under this Sub-Section.

2.   In that respect, the Parties recognise that a Party may:

(a)

engage in direct regulation either in anticipation of an issue that the Party expects may arise or to resolve an issue that has already arisen in the market; or

(b)

rely on the role of market forces, particularly with respect to market segments that are competitive or that have low barriers to entry, such as services provided by suppliers of telecommunications services that do not own network facilities.

3.   For greater certainty, a Party that refrains from engaging in regulation in accordance with subparagraph 2(b) remains subject to the obligations under this Sub-Section. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Party from applying regulation to telecommunications services.

ARTICLE 8.44

Access and use

1.   Each Party shall ensure that any service supplier of the other Party is accorded access to, and use of, public telecommunications transport networks and services on terms and conditions which are reasonable, non-discriminatory and no less favourable than those which the supplier of those public telecommunications transport networks and services provides for its own like services under like circumstances.

4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, a Party may take such measures as are necessary to ensure the security and confidentiality of messages subject to the requirement that those measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade in services.

5.   Each Party shall ensure that no condition is imposed on access to, and use of, public telecommunications transport networks and services other than as necessary to:

(a)

safeguard the public service responsibilities of suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks and services, in particular their ability to make their networks or services available to the public generally; or

If a Party requires a supplier of public telecommunications transport services to offer its public telecommunications transport services for resale, that Party shall ensure that such supplier does not impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of its public telecommunications transport services.

ARTICLE 8.47

Enabling use of network facilities and interconnection

1.   The Parties recognise that enabling use of network facilities (53) and interconnection should in principle be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiation between the suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services concerned.

2.   Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of public telecommunications transport networks or services in its territory has a right and, if requested by a supplier of public telecommunications transport networks or services of the other Party, an obligation to negotiate interconnection for the purpose of providing public telecommunications transport networks or services. Each Party shall provide its regulatory authority with the power to require, where necessary, a supplier of public telecommunications transport networks or services to provide interconnection with suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services of the other Party.

3.   A Party shall not adopt or maintain any measure which obliges suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services enabling use of network facilities or providing interconnection to offer different terms and conditions to different suppliers for like services or imposes obligations that are not related to the services provided.

under terms, conditions (including with respect to technical standards, specifications, quality and maintenance) and rates which are non-discriminatory and no less favourable than those provided for its own like services under like circumstances, and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for its own like services, for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers, or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;

(b)

in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including with respect to technical standards, specifications, quality and maintenance) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the suppliers need not pay for network components or facilities that they do not require for the service to be provided; and

(c)

upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.

4.   Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services of the other Party with the opportunity to interconnect their facilities and equipment with those of a major supplier through:

(a)

a reference interconnection offer or another standard interconnection offer containing the rates, terms and conditions that the major supplier offers generally to suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services; or

(b)

the terms and conditions of an interconnection agreement in effect.

5.   Each Party shall ensure that the procedures applicable for interconnection with major suppliers in its territory are made publicly available.

6.   Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory make publicly available either their interconnection agreements or their reference interconnection offers.

7.   Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory that acquire information from another supplier of public telecommunications transport networks or services in the process of negotiating arrangements on, and as a result of, the use of network facilities or interconnection, use that information solely for the purpose for which it was supplied and respect at all times the confidentiality of information transmitted or stored.

8.   Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory enable the use of network facilities, which may include, inter alia, network elements and associated facilities, to suppliers of public telecommunications transport networks or services of the other Party on terms and conditions (including in relation to rates, technical standards, specifications, quality and maintenance) which are transparent, reasonable, non-discriminatory (including with respect to timeliness) and no less favourable than those provided for their own like services under like circumstances. (54)

ARTICLE 8.49

Regulatory authority

1.   Each Party shall ensure that its regulatory authority is legally distinct, and functionally independent (55) from any supplier of telecommunications services, telecommunications networks or telecommunications network equipment.

2.   A Party that retains ownership or control of a supplier of public telecommunications transport networks or services shall ensure effective structural separation of the regulatory function of telecommunications from activities associated with the ownership or control.

3.   Each Party shall provide its regulatory authority with the power to regulate the telecommunications sector, and to carry out the task assigned to it including enforcement of the measures relating to the obligations under this Sub-Section.

The regulatory authority shall not request more information than that which is necessary to perform its tasks and shall treat the information obtained from those suppliers in accordance with the laws and regulations of that Party relating to business confidentiality.

ARTICLE 8.50

Universal service

1.   Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligations it wishes to maintain. Those obligations are not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided that they are administered in a transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.

2.   All suppliers of telecommunications services should be eligible to provide universal service. Universal service suppliers shall be designated through a transparent, non-discriminatory and not unduly burdensome mechanism.

3.   The regulatory authority of a Party may determine whether a mechanism is required in order to compensate the net cost of the suppliers designated to provide universal service, taking into account the market benefit, if any, accruing to those suppliers, or to share the net cost of the universal service obligations.

ARTICLE 8.51

Authorisation to provide telecommunications networks and services

1.   Each Party shall authorise the provision of telecommunications networks or services, to the extent possible, upon simple notification or registration without requiring a prior explicit decision by its regulatory authority. The rights and obligations resulting from such authorisation shall be made publicly available in an easily accessible form.

2.   If necessary, a Party may require a licence for the right of use for radio frequencies and numbers, in particular in order to:

(a)

avoid harmful interference;

(b)

ensure technical quality of service; and

(c)

safeguard efficient use of spectrum.

3.   If a Party requires a licence, that Party shall make publicly available:

(a)

all the licensing criteria and a reasonable period of time normally required to reach a decision on a licence; and

(b)

the terms and conditions of individual licences.

4.   Each Party shall notify an applicant of the outcome of its application without undue delay after a decision on the licence has been taken. In case a decision is taken to deny an application for or revoke a licence, each Party shall make known to the applicant, in principle in writing, upon request, the reasons for the denial or revocation. In that case, the applicant shall be able to have recourse to an appeal body as referred to in Article 8.54.

5.   Each Party shall ensure that any administrative fees imposed on suppliers of telecommunications networks or services are objective, transparent and commensurate with the administrative costs of its regulatory authority. Those administrative fees do not include payments for rights to use scarce resources and mandated contributions to universal service provision.

ARTICLE 8.52

Allocation and use of scarce resources

1.   Each Party shall carry out any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources related to telecommunications, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, in an open, objective, timely, transparent, non-discriminatory and not unduly burdensome manner.

2.   Each Party shall make publicly available the current state of allocated frequency bands, but shall not be required to provide detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses.

3.   Measures by a Party allocating and assigning spectrum and managing frequency are not per se inconsistent with Articles 8.7 and 8.15. Accordingly, each Party retains the right to establish and apply spectrum and frequency management policies that have the effect of limiting the number of suppliers of public telecommunications transport services, provided that the Party does so in a manner consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement. That right includes the ability to allocate frequency bands, taking into account current and future needs and spectrum availability.

ARTICLE 8.53

Transparency

Each Party shall ensure that its measures relating to access to, and use of, public telecommunications transport networks and services are made publicly available, including measures relating to:

(a)

tariffs and other terms and conditions of service;

(b)

specifications of technical interfaces;

(c)

bodies responsible for the preparation, amendment and adoption of standards affecting the access and use;

(a)

a standstill period between the contract award decision and the conclusion of a contract in order to give sufficient time to unsuccessful suppliers to assess whether it is appropriate to initiate a review procedure; or

In this regard, if the review body of the Party is not a court and a supplier believes that there has been a breach of the domestic laws and regulations implementing the obligations under this Chapter, the supplier may bring the matter before a court, including with a view to seeking compensation, in accordance with judicial procedures of the Party.

notify the other Party in writing; and

(b)

include in the notification a proposal for appropriate compensatory adjustments to the other Party to maintain a level of coverage comparable to that existing prior to the modification.

4.   Notwithstanding subparagraph 3(b), a Party does not need to provide compensatory adjustments if the modification concerns a procuring entity over whose procurement the Party has effectively eliminated its control or influence.

5.   In the event the Committee on Government Procurement established by Article XXI of the GPA adopts criteria pursuant to subparagraphs 8(b) and (c) of Article XIX of the GPA, those criteria shall be applicable also within the context of this Article.

6.   If the other Party objects that:

(a)

an adjustment proposed in accordance with subparagraph 3(b) is inadequate to maintain a comparable level of mutually agreed coverage; or

the intended modification referred to in paragraph 4 concerns a procuring entity over whose procurement the Party has not effectively eliminated its control or influence,

it shall submit an objection in writing to the Party intending to modify its commitments within 45 days from the date of receipt of the notification referred to in subparagraph 3(a) or be deemed to have accepted the adjustment or modification.

7.   The following changes to a Party's commitments under Part 2 of Annex 10 shall be considered a rectification:

(a)

a change in the name of a procuring entity;

a merger of two or more procuring entities listed in the same paragraph of Part 2 of Annex 10;

(c)

the separation of a procuring entity listed in Part 2 of Annex 10 into two or more procuring entities that are added to the procuring entities listed in the same paragraph of that Part; and

9.   The other Party may, within 45 days from the date of receipt of the notification pursuant to paragraph 8, submit an objection in writing to the Party intending to rectify its commitments. The Party submitting an objection shall set out the reasons why it believes the intended rectification is not a change provided for in paragraph 7, and describe the effect of the intended rectification on the mutually agreed coverage provided for in this Agreement. If no such objection is submitted in writing within 45 days from the date of receipt of the notification, the intended rectification shall be deemed to have been accepted.

10.   If the Party objects to the intended modification or rectification, or to the proposed compensatory adjustment, the Parties shall seek to resolve the issue through consultations. If no agreement between the Parties is reached within 150 days from the date of receipt of the notification of the objection, the Party intending to modify or rectify its commitments may have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 21 to determine whether the objection is justified.

2.   For the purposes of this Chapter, ‘geographical indications’ means indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that Party's territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.

3.   Geographical indications of a Party listed in Annex 14-B shall be protected by the other Party under this Agreement if they fall within the types of goods that the other Party protects in accordance with its laws and regulations as listed in Annex 14-A.

ARTICLE 14.23

1.   Each Party shall establish or maintain a system for the registration (87) and protection of geographical indications in its territory.

2.   The system referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain at least the following elements:

(a)

an official means to make available to the public the list of registered geographical indications;

(b)

an administrative process to verify that a geographical indication to be registered as referred to in subparagraph (a) identifies a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that Party's territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin;

(c)

an opposition procedure that allows the legitimate interests of third parties to be taken into account; and

(d)

a procedure for the cancellation (88) of the protection of a geographical indication, taking into account the legitimate interests of third parties and the users of the registered geographical indications in question. (89)

ARTICLE 14.24

Lists of geographical indications

1.   Following the completion of an opposition procedure and an examination of the geographical indications of the European Union listed in Section A of Part 1 and Section A of Part 2 of Annex 14-B, Japan shall recognise that those indications are geographical indications within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 22 of the TRIPS Agreement and that they have been registered by the European Union under the system referred to in Article 14.23. Japan shall protect those geographical indications in accordance with this Sub-Section.

2.   Following the completion of an opposition procedure and an examination of the geographical indications of Japan listed in Section B of Part 1 and Section B of Part 2 of Annex 14-B, the European Union shall recognise that those indications are geographical indications within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 22 of the TRIPS Agreement and that they have been registered by Japan under the system referred to in Article 14.23. The European Union shall protect those geographical indications in accordance with this Sub-Section.

ARTICLE 14.25

Scope of protection of geographical indications

1.   Subject to Article 14.29 each Party shall, in respect of geographical indications of the other Party listed in Annex 14-B, provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent in its territory: (90)

(a)

the use of a geographical indication identifying a good for a like good (91) not meeting the applicable requirement of specifications of the geographical indication even if:

(i)

the true origin of the good is indicated;

(ii)

the geographical indication is used (92) in translation or transliteration (93); or

(iii)

the geographical indication is accompanied by expressions such as ‘kind’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘imitation’, or the like;

(b)

the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than the true place of origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin or nature of the good; and

(c)

any other use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of Article 10bis of the Paris Convention.

2.   Each Party may determine the practical conditions under which the homonymous geographical indications will be differentiated from each other in its territory, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled.

3.   If a Party intends to protect, pursuant to an international agreement, a geographical indication of a third country which is homonymous with a geographical indication of the other Party which is protected under this Agreement, the former Party shall inform no later than on the date of the publication for opposition, the other Party of the opportunity to comment, provided that such opposition procedure for the relevant geographical indication of the third country to be protected commences after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

4.   In the opposition procedure and examination referred to in Article 14.24, each Party may consider the following grounds on which that Party shall not be required to protect a name as a geographical indication in Annex 14-B:

(a)

that name conflicts with the name of a plant variety or an animal breed and as a result is likely to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the good; and

(b)

that name is the term customary in common language as the common name for the good concerned.

5.   Notwithstanding the specifications of geographical indication referred to in subparagraph 1(a), for a period of seven years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the protection provided for under this Sub-Section for a particular geographical indication of the European Union as listed in Annex 14-B shall not preclude, with regard to the good identified with such geographical indication, the possibility that operations comprised of grating, slicing and packaging, including cutting into portions and inner packaging, could be carried out within the territory of Japan, provided that such good is destined for the Japanese market and not for the purpose of re-exportation.

6.   The Parties shall review the implementation of the provisions of paragraph 5 no later than three years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution before the end of the seven-year period referred to in that paragraph.

ARTICLE 14.26

Scope of the use of geographical indications

1.   Any person may use any geographical indication protected under this Sub-Section provided that such use is related to the goods as identified by that geographical indication and in compliance with the scope of protection under this Agreement.

2.   Once a geographical indication of a Party is protected under this Agreement in the other Party, the legitimate use of such protected name shall not be subject to any user registration or further charges in the other Party.

ARTICLE 14.27

Relationship with trademarks

1.   If a geographical indication is protected under this Sub-Section, each Party shall refuse to register a trademark the use of which would be likely to mislead as to the quality of the good, provided that an application to register the trademark is submitted after the applicable date for protection of the geographical indication in the territory concerned (94) as referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3. Trademarks registered in breach of this paragraph shall be invalidated.

2.   For geographical indications referred to in Article 14.24 and listed in Annex 14-B on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the applicable date for protection shall be the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

3.   For geographical indications referred to in Article 14.30 and not listed in Annex 14-B on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the applicable date for protection shall be the date on which the amendment to Annex 14-B enters into force.

4.   The Parties acknowledge that the existence of a prior conflicting trademark in a Party would not completely preclude the protection under this Agreement of a subsequent geographical indication for like goods in that Party. (95)

5.   If a trademark has been applied for or registered in good faith, or if rights to a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith, in a Party, before a geographical indication is protected under this Agreement in that Party, measures adopted to implement this Sub-Section shall not prejudice the eligibility for or the validity of the registration of the trademark, or the right to use the trademark, on the basis that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, the geographical indication.

ARTICLE 14.28

Enforcement of protection

Each Party shall authorise its competent authorities to take appropriate measures ex officio or on request of an interested party in accordance with its laws and regulations to protect geographical indications listed in Annex 14-B.

Goods produced in the former Party and concerned by such uses shall bear clear and visible indication of the true geographical origin.

2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of Article 14.25, except when paragraph 4 of Article 24 of the TRIPS Agreement is applicable, a Party shall prevent maintaining the prior use in its territory of a particular geographical indication of the other Party listed in Annex 14-B identifying wine, spirit or other alcoholic beverage for a like good in connection with goods or services after a transitional period of a maximum of five years from the date of the protection by the former Party of the said geographical indication. Goods produced in the former Party and concerned by such uses shall bear clear and visible indication of the true geographical origin.

3.   Each Party may determine the practical conditions under which such use referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 will be differentiated from the geographical indication in its territory, taking into account the need to ensure that consumers are not misled.

4.   The transitional period referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply if the use of the geographical indication for the good concerned which is produced in the territory of the other Party as referred to in paragraph 1 does not comply with the relevant laws and regulations as listed in Annex 14-A applicable in the territory of that Party.

5.   Nothing in this Sub-Section shall prejudice the right of any person to use, in the course of trade, that person's name or the name of that person's predecessor in business, except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.

Amendment of the lists of geographical indications

1.   The Parties agree on the possibility to amend the lists of geographical indications in Annex 14-B in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 14.53 after having completed the opposition procedure and after having examined the geographical indications as referred to in Article 14.24 to the satisfaction of both Parties.

2.   Paragraph 4 of Article 14.25 applies as regards the addition of a name to be protected as a geographical indication in Annex 14-B.

That request shall be notified simultaneously to the Party complained against.

may be applied to sectors that are subject to dispute settlement in accordance with Article 21.2 other than the sector or sectors in which the panel has found nullification or impairment, in particular if the complaining Party is of the view that such suspension is effective in inducing compliance.

That request shall be notified simultaneously to the complaining Party. The original panel shall notify to the Parties its decision on the matter no later than 30 days after the date of submission of the request.

That request shall be notified simultaneously to the Party complained against. The decision of the panel shall be notified to the Parties no later than 45 days after the date of submission of the request. If the panel decides that the measure notified in accordance with paragraph 1 is consistent with the relevant covered provisions, the suspension of concessions or other obligations, or the application of the compensation or alternative arrangement, shall be terminated no later than 15 days after the date of the decision.
