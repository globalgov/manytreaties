2. Notwithstanding Article 2(2)(b), materials originating in the Community within the meaning of this Protocol shall be considered as materials originating in Israel and it shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone working or processing.

Article 4

Wholly obtained products

1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained either in the Community or in Israel:

(a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;

(b) vegetable products harvested there;

(c) live animals born and raised there;

(d) products from live animals raised there;

(e) products obtained by hunting or fishing there;

- which are registered or recorded in a Member State of the Community or in Israel,

- which sail under the flag of a Member State of the Community or of Israel,

1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained in the Community or in Israel are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed there when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II, in conjunction with the Notes in Annex I, are fulfilled.

These conditions indicate, for all products covered or not by the Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of these products, and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list for that product, is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 and except as provided in Article 12(4), non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list for a given product, should not be used in the manufacture of this product may nevertheless be used, provided that:

(b) where, in the list, one or several percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials, such percentages are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.

This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply except as provided in Article 6.

Article 6

Insufficient working or processing operations

The following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:

f) simple assembly of parts to constitute a complete product;

g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);

h) slaughter of animals.

Article 7

Unit of qualification

1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.

Accordingly, it follows that:

(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;

(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.

2. Where, under general rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.

Article 8

Accessories, spare parts and tools

Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.

Article 9

Sets

Sets, as defined in general rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.

Article 10

Neutral elements

In order to determine whether a product originates in the Community or in Israel it shall not be necessary to establish whether the electrical energy, fuel, plant and equipment as well as machines and tools used to obtain such product, or whether any goods, used in the course of production which do not enter and which were not intended to enter into the final composition of the product, are originating or not.

TITLE III

TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS

Article 11

Principle of territoriality

The conditions set out in Title II relative to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or in Israel. For this purpose, the acquisition of originating status shall be considered as interrupted when goods which have undergone working or processing in the Party concerned have left the territory of this Party, except as provided in Articles 12 and 13.

Article 12

Working or processing carried out outside one of the Parties

1. The acquisition of originating status in one of the Parties under the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing carried out outside this Party and subsequently reimported there, provided that:

(b) it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(i) the reimported goods result from the working or processing of the exported materials; and

(ii) the total added value acquired outside the Party concerned through the application of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the final product for which originating status is claimed.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the conditions set out in Title II relative to the acquisition of originating status shall not apply in respect of working or processing carried out outside the Party concerned. Nevertheless, where, in the relevant list of Annex II, a rule giving the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used is applied in determining the originating status of the final product concerned, the total value of the non-originating materials used in the Party concerned and the total added value acquired outside this Party through the application of this Article taken together shall not exceed the percentage given.

3. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, "total added value" shall mean all costs accumulated outside the Party concerned, including all the value of the materials added there.

4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the relevant list rule and which can only be considered as sufficiently worked or processed as a result of the application of the general tolerance in Article 5(2).

5. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.

Article 13

Reimportation of goods

Goods exported from the Community or Israel to a third country and subsequently returned, shall be considered as never having left the concerned Party if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(a) the goods returned are the same goods as those exported; and

(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.

Article 14

Direct transport

1. The preferential treatment provided for under the Agreement applies only to products or materials which are transported between the territories of the Community and Israel without entering any other territory. However, goods originating in the Community or in Israel and constituting one single consignment which is not split up may be transported through territory other than that of the Community or Israel with, should the occasion arise, transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that the goods have remained under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or of warehousing and that they have not undergone operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.

Products originating in the Community or in Israel may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the Community or that of Israel.

(i) giving an exact description of the products;

(ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships used; and

(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or

c) failing these, any substantiating documents.

Article 15

Exhibitions

1. Products sent from one of the Parties for exhibition in a third country and sold after the exhibition for importation in another Party shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement on condition that the products meet the requirements of this Protocol entitling them to be recognised as originating in the Community or in Israel and provided that it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(a) an exporter has consigned these products from one of the Parties to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;

(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in another Party;

The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the nature of the products and the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.

3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.

TITLE IV

DRAWBACK OR EXEMPTION

Article 16

Prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties

1. Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the Community or in Israel within the meaning of this Protocol for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in any of the Parties to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.

2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in any of the Parties to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use in this Party.

3. The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.

4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 7(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 8 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 9 when such items are non-originating.

5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which the Agreement applies.

TITLE V

PROOF OF ORIGIN

Article 17

General requirements

1. Originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, on importation into one of the Parties, benefit from the Agreement upon submission of either:

(a) a movement certificate EUR.1, a specimen of which appears in Annex III; or

(b) in the cases specified in Article 22(1), a declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV, given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified (hereinafter referred to as the "invoice declaration").

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating products within the meaning of this Protocol shall, in the cases specified in Article 27, benefit from this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to above.

Article 18

Procedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.

2. For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex III.

These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which the Agreement is drawn up, in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If they are handwritten, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

4. The movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Member State of the European Community if the goods to be exported can be considered as products originating in the Community within the meaning of Article 2(1) of this Protocol. The movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of Israel if the goods to be exported can be considered as products originating in Israel within the meaning of Article 2(2) of this Protocol.

5. When the provisions of Article 3 are applied, the customs authorities of the Member State of the Community or of Israel may issue movement certificates EUR.1 under the conditions laid down in this Protocol if the goods to be exported can be considered as originating products within the meaning of this Protocol and provided that the goods covered by the movement certificates EUR.1 are in the Community or in Israel.

In these cases movement certificates EUR.1 shall be issued subject to the presentation of the proof of origin previously issued or made out. This proof of origin must be kept for at least three years by the customs authorities of the exporting State.

6. The issuing customs authorities shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check which they consider appropriate.

The issuing customs authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

7. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in the part of the certificate reserved for the customs authorities.

8. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country when the products to which it relates are exported. It shall be made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

Article 19

Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding Article 18(8), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

(a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or

(b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.

2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in this application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.

3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file.

4. Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with one of the following phrases:

5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the "Remarks" box of the movement certificate EUR.1.

Article 20

Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with one of the following words:

"DUPLIKAT",

"DUPLICATA",

"DUPLICATO",

"DUPLICAAT",

"DUPLICATE",

"ΑΝΤΙΓΡΑΦΟ",

"DUPLICADO",

"SEGUNDA VIA",

"KAKSOISKAPPALE",

"

>PIC FILE= "L_2000147EN.005602.TIF">".

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2, the date of issue and the serial number of the original certificate shall be inserted in the "Remarks" box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.

4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.

Article 21

Replacement of certificates

1. It shall at any time be possible to replace one or more movement certificates EUR.1 by one or more other certificates provided that this is done by the customs office responsible for controlling the goods.

2. The replacement certificate shall be regarded as a definite movement certificate EUR.1 for the purpose of the application of this Protocol, including the provisions of this Article.

3. The replacement certificate shall be issued on the basis of a written request from the re-exporter, after the authorities concerned have verified the information supplied in the applicant's request. The date and serial number of the original movement certificate EUR.1 shall be given in box 7.

Article 22

Conditions for making out an invoice declaration

1. An invoice declaration as referred to in Article 17(1)(b) may be made out:

(a) by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23;

(b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed ECU 6000.

2. An invoice declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in one of the Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

3. The exporter making out an invoice declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

4. An invoice declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex IV, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. The declaration may also be handwritten; in such a case, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.

5. Invoice declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript.

However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 23 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting country a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any invoice declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.

6. An invoice declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported (or exceptionally after exportation). If the invoice declaration is made out after the products to which it relates have been declared to the customs authorities in the importing country, this invoice declaration must bear a reference to the documents already submitted to these authorities.

Article 23

Approved exporter

1. The customs authorities of the exporting country may authorise any exporter, hereinafter referred to as "approved exporter", who makes frequent shipments of products under this Agreement, and who offers to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of those products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol, to make out invoice declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned.

2. The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.

3. The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the invoice declaration.

4. The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.

5. The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, does not fulfil the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.

Article 24

Validity of proof of origin

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting country, and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.

An invoice declaration shall be valid for four months from the date it was made out by the exporter and must be submitted within the said period to the customs authorities of the importing country.

2. Movement certificates EUR.1 and invoice declarations which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to reasons of force majeure or exceptional circumstances.

3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations where the products have been submitted to them before the said final date.

Article 25

Submission of proof of origin

Movement certificates EUR.1 and invoice declarations shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice declaration. They may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of the Agreement.

Article 26

Importation by instalments

Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing country, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of general rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or heading Nos 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.

Article 27

Exemptions from formal proof of origin

1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a formal proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration C2/CP3 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.

2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.

3. Furthermore, the total value of these products must not exceed ECU 500 in the case of small packages or ECU 1200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.

Article 28

Preservation of proof of origin and supporting documents

1. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the documents referred to in Article 18(3).

3. The customs authorities of the exporting country issuing a movement certificate EUR.1 shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in Article 18(2).

4. The customs authorities of the importing country shall keep for at least three years the movement certificates EUR.1 and the invoice declarations submitted to them.

Article 29

Discrepancies and formal errors

1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in a movement certificate EUR.1, or in an invoice declaration, and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the movement certificate EUR.1, or the invoice declaration, null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.

2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a movement certificate EUR.1, or an invoice declaration, should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.

Article 30

Amounts expressed in ecus

1. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting country equivalent to the amounts expressed in ecus shall be fixed by the exporting country and communicated to the other Parties.

When the amounts exceed the corresponding amounts fixed by the importing country, the latter shall accept them if the products are invoiced in the currency of the exporting country.

If the goods are invoiced in the currency of another Member State of the Community the importing State shall recognise the amount notified by the country concerned.

2. Up to and including 30 April 2000, the amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the amounts expressed in ecus as at 1 October 1994.

For each successive period of five years, the amounts expressed in ecus and their equivalents in the national currencies of the States shall be reviewed by the Association Council on the basis of the exchange rates of the ecu as at the first working day in October in the year immediately preceding that five-year period.

When carrying out this review, the Association Council shall ensure that there will be no decrease in the amounts to be used in any national currency and shall furthermore consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in ecus.

TITLE VI

ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION

Article 32

Verification of proof of origin

1. Subsequent verification of movement certificates EUR.1 and of invoice declarations shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reasonable doubt as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing country shall return the movement certificate EUR.1, and the invoice, if it has been submitted, or the invoice declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting country giving, where appropriate, the reasons of substance or form for an inquiry.

They shall forward, in support of the request for subsequent verification, any documents and information that have been obtained suggesting that the information given on the movement certificate EUR.1 or the invoice declaration is incorrect.

4. If the customs authorities of the importing country decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, they shall offer to release the products to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.

5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification within a maximum period of 10 months. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as originating products and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

Where the cumulation provisions of Article 3(2) and Article 18(4) were applied, the reply shall include a copy (copies) of the movement certificate(s) or invoice declaration(s) relied upon.

6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in the case of force majeure or in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.

Article 33

Dispute settlement

Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 32 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Customs Cooperation Committee.

In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing State shall be under the legislation of the said State.

Article 34

Penalties

Penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.

Article 35

Free zones

1. The Member States and Israel shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a movement certificate EUR.1, which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and that they do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.

2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or in Israel are imported into a free zone under cover of an EUR.1 certificate and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter's request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.

ANNEX I

INTRODUCTORY NOTES

Preliminary remarks

The rules established in the present list are only applicable to products covered by the Agreement.

Note 1

1.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number, or chapter number, used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rule in columns 3 or 4 only applies to the part of that heading or chapter as described in column 2.

1.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of product in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in columns 3 or 4 applies to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified within headings of the chapter or within any of the headings grouped together in column 1.

1.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.

1.4. Where, for any entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 has to be applied.

Note 2

2.1. The working or processing required by a rule in column 3 has to be carried out only in relation to the non-originating materials used. The restrictions contained in a rule in column 3 likewise apply only to the non-originating materials used.

2.2. Where a rule states that "materials of any heading" may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression "manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No...." means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.

2.3. If a product made from non-originating materials which has acquired originating status during manufacture by virtue of the change of heading rule or its own list rule is used as a material in the process of manufacture of another product, then the rule applicable to the product in which it is incorporated does not apply to it.

For example::

An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from "other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging" of heading No 7224.

If this forging has been forged in the country concerned from a non-originating ingot then the forging has already acquired origin by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. It can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or another. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.

2.4. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer origin. Thus if a rule says that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.

2.5. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.

Example:

The rule for fabrics of ex Chapter 50 to Chapter 55 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other or both.

2.6. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also note 5.2 below in relation to textiles.)

Example:

The rule for prepared food of heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals or their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not produced from cereals.

However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular material specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.

Example:

In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.

2.7. Where in a rule in the list two or more percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.

Note 3

3.1. The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres and is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, the term "natural fibres" includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.

3.2. The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.

3.3. The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.

3.4. The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings Nos 5501 to 5507.

Note 4

4.1. Where for a given product in the list a reference is made to this note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product, which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (See also notes 4.3 and 4.4).

4.2. However, this tolerance may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:

- silk

- wool

- coarse animal hair

- fine animal hair

- horsehair

- cotton

- paper-making materials and paper

- flax

- true hemp

- jute and other textile bast fibres

- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave

- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres

- synthetic man-made filaments

- artificial man-made filaments

- synthetic man-made staple fibres

- artificial man-made staple fibres.

Example:

A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the yarn.

Example:

A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the fabric.

Example:

Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.

Example:

If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.

Example:

A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight taken together does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the textile materials in the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.

4.3. In the case of fabrics incorporating "yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped" this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.

4.4. In the case of fabrics incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two films of plastic film, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.

Note 5

5.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials with the exception of linings and interlinings which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up products concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.

5.2. Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely, whether or not they contain textiles.

Example:

If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.

5.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

Note 6

6.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the "specific processes" are the following:

(a) vacuum distillation;

(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(1);

(c) cracking;

(d) reforming;

(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;

(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;

(g) polymerisation;

(h) alkylation;

(i) isomerisation.

6.2. For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the "specific processes" are the following:

(a) vacuum distillation;

(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;

(c) cracking;

(d) reforming;

(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;

(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid (oleum) or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;

(g) polymerisation;

(h) alkylation;

(i) isomerisation;

(k) (in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only) desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);

(l) (in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only) deparaffining by a process other than filtering;

(m) (in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only) treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of heading No ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolorisation) in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;

(n) (in respect of fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only) atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C by the ASTM D 86 method;

(o) (in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only) treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge.

6.3. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.

on mutual assistance between administrative authorities in customs matters

Article 1

Definitions

For the purposes of this Protocol:

(a) "customs legislation" shall mean provisions adopted by the Parties and governing the import, export, transit of goods and their placing under any customs procedure, including measures of prohibition, restriction and control;

(b) "customs duties" shall mean all duties, taxes, fees or other charges which are levied and collected in the territories of the Parties, in application of customs legislation, but not including fees and charges which are limited in amount to the approximate costs of services rendered;

(c) "applicant authority" shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been appointed by a Party for this purpose and which makes a request for assistance in customs matters;

(d) "requested authority" shall mean a competent administrative authority which has been appointed by a Party for this purpose and which receives a request for assistance in customs matters;

(e) "personal data" shall mean all information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.

Article 2

Scope

1. The Parties shall assist each other, within their competences, in the manner and under the conditions laid down in this Protocol, in ensuring that customs legislation is correctly applied, in particular by the prevention, detection and investigation of operations in breach of that legislation.

2. Assistance in customs matters, as provided for in this Protocol, shall apply to any administrative authority of the Parties which is competent for the application of this Protocol. It shall not prejudice the rules governing mutual assistance in criminal matters. Nor shall it cover information obtained under powers exercised at the request of the judicial authorities, unless those authorities so agree.

Article 3

Assistance on request

1. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall furnish it with all relevant information which may enable it to ensure that customs legislation is correctly applied, including information regarding operations noted or planned which are or could be in breach of such legislation.

2. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall inform it whether goods exported from the territory of one of the Parties have been properly imported into the territory of the other Party, specifying, where appropriate, the customs procedure applied to the goods.

3. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall take the necessary steps to ensure that a special watch is kept on:

(a) natural or legal persons of whom there are reasonable grounds for believing that they are breaching or have breached customs legislation;

(b) places where goods are stored in a way that gives grounds for suspecting that they are intended to supply operations contrary to customs legislation;

(c) movements of goods notified as possibly giving rise to breaches of customs legislation;

(d) means of transport for which there are reasonable grounds for believing that they have been, are or may be used in operations in breach of customs legislation.

Article 4

Spontaneous assistance

The Parties shall provide each other, in accordance with their laws, rules and other legal instruments, with assistance if they consider that to be necessary for the correct application of customs legislation, particularly when they obtain information pertaining to:

- operations which constitute, or appear to them to constitute breaches of such legislation and which may be of interest to other Parties,

- new means or methods employed in realising such operations,

- goods known to be subject to breaches of customs legislation.

Article 5

Delivery/notification

At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall in accordance with its legislation take all necessary measures in order:

- to deliver all documents,

- to notify all decisions,

falling within the scope of this Protocol to an addressee, residing or established in its territory. In such a case Article 6(3) shall apply.

Article 6

Form and substance of requests for assistance

1. Requests pursuant to this Protocol shall be made in writing. Documents necessary for the execution of such requests shall accompany the request. When required because of the urgency of the situation, oral requests may be accepted, but must be confirmed in writing immediately.

2. Requests pursuant to paragraph 1 shall include the following information:

(a) the applicant authority making the request;

(b) the actions to be undertaken;

(c) the object of and the reason for the request;

(d) the laws, rules and other legal elements involved;

(e) indications as exact and comprehensive as possible on the natural or legal persons being the target of the investigations;

(f) a summary of the relevant facts and of the enquiries already carried out, except in cases provided for in Article 5.

3. Requests shall be submitted in an official language of the requested authority or in a language acceptable to such authority.

4. If a request does not meet the formal requirements, its correction or completion may be demanded; the ordering of precautionary measures may, however, take place.

Article 7

Execution of requests

1. 1. In order to comply with a request for assistance, the requested authority or, when the latter cannot act on its own, the administrative department to which the request has been addressed by this authority, shall proceed, within its competence and available resources, as though it were acting on its own account or at the request of other authorities of that same Party, by supplying information already possessed, by carrying out appropriate enquiries or by arranging for them to be carried out.

2. Requests for assistance will be executed in accordance with the laws, rules and other legal instruments of the requested Party.

3. Officials of the requesting Party, authorised to investigate breaches of customs legislation may, in particular cases and with the agreement of the requested Party, be present respectively in the Community or in Israel, when its officials are investigating breaches which are of concern to the requesting Party and may ask that the requested Party review relevant books, registers and other documents or data-media and supply copies thereof or provide any information relating to the breach.

Article 8

Form in which information is to be communicated

1. The requested authority shall communicate results of enquiries to the applicant authority in the form of documents, certified copies of documents, reports and the like.

2. The documents provided for in paragraph 1 may be replaced by computerised information produced in any form for the same purpose.

Article 9

Exceptions to the obligation to provide assistance

1. The Parties may refuse to give assistance as provided for in this Protocol, where to do so would:

(a) be likely to prejudice the sovereignty of a Member State of the Community or of Israel which has been asked for assistance under this Protocol; or

(b) be likely to prejudice public policy, security or other essential interests; or

(c) involve currency or tax regulations other than regulations concerning customs duties; or

(d) violate an industrial, commercial or professional secret.

2. Where the applicant authority asks for assistance which it would itself be unable to provide if so asked, it shall draw attention to that fact in its request. It shall then be left to the requested authority to decide how to respond to such a request.

3. If assistance is withheld or denied, the decision and the reasons therefore must be notified to the applicant authority without delay.

Article 10

Obligation to observe confidentiality

1. Any information communicated in whatsoever form pursuant to this Protocol shall be of a confidential nature. It shall be covered by the obligation of official secrecy and shall enjoy the protection extended to like information under the relevant laws of the Party which received it and the corresponding provisions applying to the Community authorities.

2. Personal data may only be transmitted if the level of personal protection afforded by the legislations of the Parties is equivalent. The Parties shall ensure at least a level of protection based on the principles of Council of Europe Convention No 108 of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.

Article 11

Use of information

1. Information obtained shall be used solely for the purposes of this Protocol and may be used within each Party for other purposes only with the prior written consent of the administrative authority which furnished the information and shall be subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not impede the use of information in any judicial or administrative proceedings subsequently instituted for failure to comply with customs legislation.

Article 12

Experts and witnesses

An official of a requested authority may be authorised to appear, within the limitations of the authorisation granted, as expert or witness in judicial or administrative proceedings regarding the matters covered by this Protocol in the jurisdiction of another Party, and produce such objects, documents or authenticated copies thereof, as may be needed for the proceedings. The request for an appearance must indicate specifically on what matters and by virtue of what title or qualification the official will be questioned.

Article 13

Assistance expenses

The Parties shall waive all claims on each other for the reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to this Protocol, except, as appropriate, for expenses to experts and witnesses and to interpreters and translators who are not public service employees.

Article 14

Implementation

1. The application of this Protocol shall be entrusted to the competent services of the Commission of the European Communities and, where appropriate, the customs authorities of the Member States of the Community on the one hand and to the central customs authorities of Israel on the other hand. They shall decide on all practical measures and arrangements necessary for its application, taking into consideration rules in the field of data protection. They may recommend to the competent bodies amendments which they consider be made to this Protocol.

2. The Parties shall consult each other and subsequently keep each other informed of the detailed rules of implementation which are adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol.

Article 15

Complementarity

1. This Protocol shall complement and not impede the application of any agreements on mutual assistance which have been concluded or may be concluded between individual or several Member States of the Community and Israel. Nor shall it preclude more extensive mutual assistance granted under such agreements.

2. Without prejudice to Article 11, these agreements do not prejudice Community provisions governing the communication between the competent services of the Commission and the customs authorities of the Member States of any information obtained in customs matters which could be of Community interest.

For the Government of Israel

AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS

between the Community and Israel relating to Protocol 1 and concerning imports into the Community of fresh cut flowers and flower buds falling within subheading 060310 of the Common Customs Tariff

A. Letter from the Community

Sir,

The following was agreed between the Community and Israel:

Protocol 1 provides for the elimination of customs duties on imports into the Community of cut flowers and flower buds, fresh, falling within subheading 060310 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Israel, subject to a limit of 19500 tonnes.

Israel undertakes to abide by the conditions laid down below for imports into the Community of roses and carnations which qualify for the elimination of this tariff:

- the price level of imports into the Community must be at least equal to 85 % of the Community price level for the same products over the same periods,

- the Israeli price level shall be determined by recording the prices of the imported products, on representative Community import markets,

- the Community price level shall be based on the producer prices recorded on representative markets of the main producer Member States,

- price levels will be recorded on a fortnightly basis and weighted by the respective quantities. This provision is valid for Community prices and for Israeli prices,

- for both Community producer prices and the import prices of Israeli products, a distinction shall be made between large-flowered and small-flowered roses and between unifloral and multifloral carnations,

- if the Israeli price level for any one type of product is below 85 % of the Community price level, the tariff preference shall be suspended. The Community shall reinstate the tariff preference when an Israeli price level equal to 85 % or more of the Community price level is recorded.

Israel further undertakes to maintain the traditional breakdown of trade between roses and carnations.

Should the Community market be disturbed by a change in this breakdown, the Community reserves the right to determine the proportions in line with traditional trade patterns. In such cases, an appropriate exchange of views could take place.

I should be obliged if you would confirm that your Government is in agreement with the contents of this letter.

Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

On behalf of the Council of the European Union

B. Letter from Israel

Should the Community market be disturbed by a change in this breakdown, the Community reserves the right to determine the proportions in line with traditional trade patterns. In such cases, an appropriate exchange of views could take place.

I should be obliged if you would confirm that your Government is in agreement with the contents of this letter."

I have the honour to confirm that my Government is in agreement with the contents of your letter.

Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS

between the Community and Israel regarding the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements

A. Letter from the Community

Sir,

The Agreement reached between the European Community and Israel does not contain any provisions regarding the new regime applied on the import of oranges into the Community. The Parties will continue negotiations on this matter in order to find a solution before the beginning of the marketing year 1995/1996, i.e. 1 December. In this context, the Community has agreed that Israel will not be treated less favourably than other Mediterranean partners.

By 1 December 1995, if an accord has not been reached regarding the entry price for oranges, the Community will take all necessary measures to guarantee to Israel an adequate and acceptable entry price for both Parties, which will enable the importation of 200000 tonnes of oranges from Israel, a figure which will imply a reduction of 30 % from the actual tariff quota for oranges from Israel.

In addition, the Community will adopt the appropriate measures to allow the import into the Community of traditional Israeli non-Annex II processed agricultural products covered by concessions in the new Agreement.

Similarly, if necessary, Israel will take parallel measures to ensure the import of traditional Community exports of agricultural products for the 1995/1996 season.

I should be grateful if you would kindly inform me whether the Government of Israel is in agreement with the contents of this letter.

Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

On behalf of the Council of the European Union
