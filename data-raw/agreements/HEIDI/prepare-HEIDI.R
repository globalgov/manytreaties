# manypkgs includes several functions that should help cleaning
# and standardising your data.
# Please see the vignettes or website for more details.

# Stage three: Connecting data
# Next run the following line to make IEADB available
# within the package.
manypkgs::export_data(HEIDI, datacube = "agreements",
                      URL = "https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/en/data/heidi")
# This function also does two additional things.
# First, it creates a set of tests for this object to ensure
# adherence to certain standards. You can hit Cmd-Shift-T (Mac)
# or Ctrl-Shift-T (Windows) to run these tests locally at any point.
# Any test failures should be pretty self-explanatory and may require
# you to return to stage two and further clean, standardise, or wrangle
# your data into the expected format.
# Second, it also creates a documentation file for you to fill in.
# Please make sure that you cite any sources appropriately and fill
# in as much detail about the variables etc as possible.
