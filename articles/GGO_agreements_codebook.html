<p>This document provides a brief overview of the coding rationale for key variables in the list of international agreements provided in <code>manytreaties::agreements$GGO</code>.</p>
<p>Note that this dataset was constructed as a complement to datasets such as the International Environmental Agreements Database (<code>manytreaties::agreements$IEADB</code>) and the Design of Trade Agreements Database (<code>manytreaties::agreements$DESTA</code>). As such, it is neither complete in observations nor variables, yet offers more specificity and some additional entries compared to such other datasets.</p>
<p>Work on this dataset was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) <a href="https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188976" class="external-link">Grant Number 188976</a>: “Power and Networks and the Rate of Change in Institutional Complexes” (PANARCHIC).</p>

<p><em>Geneva, Switzerland</em></p>
<em><a href="mailto:james.hollway@graduateinstitute.ch" class="email">james.hollway@graduateinstitute.ch</a></em>
</center>
<p>The variables are as follows: treatyID, Title, Begin, End, Signature, Force, Term, Grounds, TypeDomain, TypeAgree, TypeAmbit, TypeGeo, TypeSubject, Location, Depository, Published, Secretariat, Website, TitleAlt, Language, Languages, Text, TextURL, Coder, Comments, Source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="title-titlealt">Title, TitleAlt<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#title-titlealt"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the title of the treaty or agreement. We interpret an agreement broadly to include not only formal treaties, such as treaties, conventions, or declarations, but also other types of international agreements such as memoranda of understanding, resolutions, protocols, and amendments. We generally use the title of the agreement as listed on the treaty text itself, or as listed in the source from which the treaty was identified.</p>
<p>In some situations an agreement might be known by several different titles. These situations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When treaties are recorded in different languages, or there are multiple valid versions of the treaty, translation or transliterations can result in similar but different titles</li>
<li>When treaties are recorded with different titles in different sources or databases (or versions of the database), through translation or standardisation efforts</li>
<li>When treaties are recorded with different titles by different parties to the treaty, for example a bilateral agreement might be recorded under different names by each party when they deposit it</li>
</ul>
<p>In such situations, the shorter or more common title is generally preferred for the <code>Title</code> variable, so long as it is unambiguous. If only the longer version of the title mentions the parties, subject, or other distinguishing information, then this title will be used as the <code>Title</code> variable. Any alternative titles are included in the <code>TitleAlt</code> variable, using commas to separate multiple alternative titles if necessary.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="exclusion">Exclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exclusion"></a>
</h3>
<p>While we strive to include a comprehensive list of international agreements, including agrements that are not formal treaties, for instance, but that can be filtered out by users if they wish (see <code>TypeAgree</code>), there are some agreements that we do not include. For the main part, it is because the information contained is not substantive, but rather procedural or administrative.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclude protocols of signature, accession, or confirmation (unless they come with substantive changes) -&gt; these are dealt with in memberships data</li>
<li>Exclude protocols of application or implementation, dealt with in entry into force date or (usually) as additional text</li>
<li>Exclude amendments that are minor or technical, e.g. correcting typos, changing names, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that exchanges of letters or similar documents that form part of a treaty are included.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#differentiation"></a>
</h3>
<p>In some cases treaties with exactly the same title are in fact different treaties. This might be because they were signed on different dates, or because they were signed by different parties. In other cases, treaties with different titles are actually the same treaty – signed on the same date by the same parties. We differentiated such entries as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirmed duplicates were removed from the dataset</li>
<li>confirmed non-duplicates were retained in the dataset but distinguished from each other by adding distinguishing information, such as the year or subject, to the treaty title(s).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="deduplication">Deduplication<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deduplication"></a>
</h3>
<p>In other cases, treaties with very similar titles are actually the same treaties. This is more challenging to determine. We approach this deduplication task as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We first identify potential duplicates by searching for agreements that are concluded with the same date of signature</li>
<li>From this list, we disregard those agreements that clearly concern different regions or subjects</li>
</ul>
<p>With the list of remaining potential duplicates, we then check the texts of the treaties themselves, if available, or the sources from which they were identified. We also use Google to search for the treaty title and date of signature, to see if there are any sources that clarify whether these are the same or different treaties. We use the following heuristics to assist with this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge duplications representing multiple translations</li>
<li>Similar treaty titles that refer to different articles, appendices, or annexes are retained separately</li>
<li>Keep agreements referring to different parties</li>
<li>Merge agreements that refer to the same parties but use different names for them, e.g. “the Government of X” and “the State of X”</li>
<li>Merge agreements that are identifical except one mentions the parties and the other does not</li>
<li>If we have other information that differs, such as different information for entry into force, this will cause a further check</li>
<li>If Google returns (only) the same information, then this is a suggestion that these are duplicates</li>
<li>We also note that some states or dyads have a history of concluding a set of agreements on related topics on the same day, e.g. China and Kazakhstan, and so this is also taken note of</li>
<li>If there is a document combining multiple amendments on the same day to the same treaty, and also a listing separating out the amendments, then the combined amendment will be retained</li>
<li>Merge duplications where substantive similarities and no treaty texts (or not for both) to indicate that they are different agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that agreements that are amendments or protocols to existing treaties are retained, as these are often important in their own right.</p>

<p>A bilateral treaty that is an agreement will have the following treatyID: "FRA-TON[DEZ]_1980A“. This is a combination of the parties to the agreement (FRA-TON), the activity described in the treaty, which is here”Delimitation of Economic Zone (DEZ)", with the year of signature (1980), followed by the type (A = Agreement).</p>

It is composed of the parties (RUS-USA), the subject abbreviation from treaty title”Fishing for King Crab (FKC)“, the year of signature of the amendment (1967), and the type (E) which refers to Amendment.

<p>Famous multilateral treaties have a simplified treatyID with a known abbreviation. For example, the United Nations Convention On The Law Of The Sea will have the following treatyID: “UNCLOS1982A”. This is the known abbreviation (UNCLOS), the signature year (1982) and the treaty type (A).</p>
<p>Protocols or amendments of the known treaties will have this treatyID format: “J09H_1990E2:MARPOL1973A”. It indicates the acronym (J09H), the signature year of this specific amendment (1990), the type of treaty (E), its number (2), and the treatyID of the “mother” treaty (MARPOL1973A).</p>

</h3>
<p>These are the dates when an agreement is deemed to have begun or ended. Where more precise information is available, we code also the date of signature, the date when the agreement entered into force, and the date when the agreement terminated.</p>
<p>Dates are coded using the messydates system. This implements ISO’s extended date/time format. As such, some dates are only entered as a year or are annotated with a question mark if the source is uncertain. For more details see <a href="https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/" class="external-link">messydates</a>.</p>
<p>Agreements that are known to still be in force at the time that the data was collected or checked have an end date <code>9999-12-31</code>. However, an <code>NA</code> in this field simply means that we could not verify the status of the agreement at the time of coding.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="grounds">Grounds<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#grounds"></a>
</h3>
<p>Where the agreement has been terminated, we code the grounds for termination. The grounds for a treaty’s termination is coded as one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Sunset</em>: the treaty terminates at the end of a specified period</li>
<li>
<em>Success</em>: the treaty terminates when its main purpose has been fulfilled</li>
<li>
<em>Recession</em>: the parties mutually agree to dissolve the treaty</li>
<li>
<em>Substitution</em>: the parties mutually agree to substitute the old treaty with a new one</li>
<li>
<em>Renunciation</em>: a party renounces its rights arising from the treaty</li>
<li>
<em>Withdrawal</em>: a party withdraws from the treaty</li>
<li>
<em>Extinction</em>: the treaty ends when one of the party state’s existence comes to an end</li>
<li>
<em>Other</em>: to be explained in the comments</li>
</ul>
<p>As this coding is incomplete, it is currently only available for a subset of the agreements. For more details, please reach out to the maintainer.</p>

<p>The domain is a simple character/string variable that indicates the main domain of the agreement. At the moment this is a fairly coarse coding, containing the following categories: . We have many more agreements for environment, trade, and health than the others.</p>

<em>Agreement</em>: This is a full agreement between the parties</li>
<li>
<em>Protocol</em>: This is a protocol to an existing agreement</li>
<li>
<em>Amendment</em>: This is an amendment to an existing agreement or protocol</li>
<li>
<em>MOU</em>: This is a memorandum of understanding, which is generally a non-binding agreement</li>

<em>Resolution</em>: This is a resolution, generally adopted by an international organisation</li>
<li>
<em>Regulation</em>: This is a regulation, generally adopted by an international organisation</li>
<li>
<em>Report</em>: This is a strategy document, generally adopted by an international organisation</li>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="typeambit">TypeAmbit<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#typeambit"></a>

<p>The ambit of the agreement is coded as one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Bilateral</em>: This is an agreement between (strictly) two parties</li>
<li>
<em>Trilateral</em>: This is an agreement between (strictly) three parties</li>

<p>We code geographical region more specifically than in some other datasets. We code the region descriptively and as a character string, which affords the opportunity to search by regular expression such as “America” to get “Northern America”, “Southern America”, “Central America”, and “Caribbean America”. Note that we use the adjectival form, e.g. “Southern Africa”, to distinguish the region from the country “South Africa”. We use “Central” to describe areas in the middle of the continent, if applicable. The data includes the following regions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Northern America</em></li>
<li><em>Southern America</em></li>
<li><em>Central America</em></li>
<li><em>Caribbean America</em></li>
<li><em>Northern Europe</em></li>
<li><em>Eastern Europe</em></li>
<li><em>Southeastern Europe</em></li>
<li><em>Southern Europe</em></li>
<li><em>Western Europe</em></li>

<li><em>Southern Africa</em></li>
<li><em>Western Africa</em></li>
<li><em>Central Africa</em></li>
<li><em>Oceania</em></li>
</ul>
<p>However, we code not only regions but also specific geographical features, such as rivers, seas, and oceans. Codes that appear more than 8 times include:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">#&gt; Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `Region`.</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; Unknown or uninitialised column: `Region`.</span></span>

<h3 id="typesubject">TypeSubject<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#typesubject"></a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to the <code>Region</code>, we also code the subject of the agreement. We code this as a one- or two-keyword description of the subject matter of the agreement. For example, “Water Energy”. This is a character/string variable, so users can search or filter as they wish. Filtering by regular expression is therefore possible, e.g. “Water|Energy” to get all agreements that mention either water or energy. So this could include agreements on water, energy, water and energy, water and pollution, or nuclear and energy, for instance.</p>

<p>This is the name of the city where the agreement was concluded. This has been drawn from the title of the agreement in some cases, or from the treaty text itself, or metadata available from the source from which the treaty was identified.

Since second locations are relatively rare, this will appear only in the <code>Comments</code> for now.</p>

<h3 id="secretariat-website">Secretariat, Website<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#secretariat-website"></a>
</h3>
<p>Where applicable, we code the name of the secretariat or international organisation that administers the agreement. This is drawn from the treaty text itself, or metadata available from the source from which the treaty was identified. Where available, we also provide a link to the website of the agreement or its secretariat.</p>

<h3 id="text-texturl">Text, TextURL<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#text-texturl"></a>
</h3>
<p>We have collected the text of many agreements where available. Texts for the agreements are formatted and stored in .txt files in the ‘data_raw/agreements/GGO/TreatyText’ folder within the package. The <code>Text</code> variable denotes if the corresponding text has been stored in the folder. Where possible, we provide a link to the source from which the text was obtained.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="language-languages">Language, Languages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#language-languages"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>Language</code> variable indicates the language in which the treaty text is available as a two-letter code, e.g. “en”. We retain the English language version wherever available to facilitate analysis. However, some agreements are available in other languages; these are listed in <code>Languages</code> as a pipe separated vector.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="coder-comments-source">Coder, Comments, Source<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#coder-comments-source"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>Coder</code> variable is a comma separated vector of the surnames of those who have added or verified data for each entry/observation. Where special conditions arise, the <code>Comments</code> variable offers a free text area for explanations or recording how the coding has changed from version to version. The <code>Source</code> variable should contain only links or bibliographic information for the sources used to add or verify information.</p>
